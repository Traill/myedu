			<h1 class="orange">About <span class="logo">Trail<b>Head</b></span></h1>

			<p> Trailhead is your own personal conference scheduler. To make it
			easier for you to find presentations that you care about you can
			search for people or topics and browse connections between
			articles. Whatever you find interesting you can add to your own
			schedule and download it as a pdf or add it to your calendar.</p>
			
			<p> So dive in and click away! Search for a topic you like and use
			the graph to browse between related talks. Any time you find
			something that interesting, go ahead and add it to your schedule, to
			get your own personal exquisite conference program.</p>
			
			<p> Should you later decide to add or drop a few talks, despair
			not. Trailhead let you save your schedule to come back later. All
			you need is to copy the link at the top right corner.

			<h1 class="orange"> Other use</h1>

			<p><b>Search: </b> Trailhead let you work with advances search
			features. You can select more crierions to search nodes in the
			graph. The filters are saved in the panel and you can select and
			unselect them.  </p>

			<p><b>Schedule: </b> When you're happy witht the schedule you have
			built in the panel, you can either download a pdf with all the
			information about the talks you selected, or an ical file. An ical
			file let you add events in your favorite calendar app. If you want
			to sync it with your iphone you should follow these steps: </p> <p>

			<ol class="listContent">

				<li>Create a new calendar on your computer that sync with your iphone.</li>
				<li>Add the ical events on this calendar.</li>
				<li>Connect your iphone and sync. </li>
			<ol>
			</p>

			<p>Or you can also simply send the ical file by mail on open the
			file on your iphone mail app. If you later make some changes, you
			can easily remove the old schedule in your calendar and add the new
			dates and times to your calendar</p>

			<h1 class="orange"> How does it work?</h1>


			<p>The graph you are looking at is generated by comparing the
			closeness of a bit more than 600 papers submitted to the 2012 ISIT
			in Boston. They are currently rated based on a naive bayesian
			textual comparison of the similarity of the word frequences of the
			submittet research.</p>

			<p>This project is developed with the help of a series of great
			tools. The graph is based on <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>, a
			javascript library for creating SVG graphics. The javascript
			interface is based on <a
				href="https://github.com/unscriptable/curl">Curl</a>, <a
				href="http://radio.uxder.com">Radio</a> and many more. Check
			the code out on <a href="http://github.com/traill">Github</a> for a
			full overview. If you have any ideas on how to improve this project
			or just really like it, please write and tell us at <a
