      "Content":"This course is aimed to PhD students who wish to learn the symbolic programming language \"Mathematica\" in order to model and analyze experimental results. It will give the necessary practice of Mathematica to start using it in real situations. The syntax of Mathematica expressions will be studied in details. The course is based on notebooks that are executed interactively on PC. Many examples and exercises will be fully explained. How to obtain solutions of linear or non-linear algebraic or differential systems will be shown with worked out exercises. The use of the graphical capabilities of Mathematica to present experimental or calculated results will be emphasized."
