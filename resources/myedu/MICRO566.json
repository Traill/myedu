      "Contenu":"This lecture will start with the general description of disordered materials. These materials are quite common as oxides and other large-gap semiconductors in micro-electronic applications. The effect of disorder at the atomic scale on electronic states and electronic transport properties will be discussed. Optical characteristics of such material will be given, in relationship with device applications. Then the device physics of various devices  based on disordered semiconductors will be presented:  first solar cells will be discussed and especially the relation between the material properties (absorption behavior and charge transport) on the cell efficiency. Finally other examples of large-area devices such as photo-detectors, particle sensors and Thin-Film Transistors (for flat panel displays and flat panel imagers) will be presented; the physics of these devices and some fabrication aspects will also been discussed.[br/]",
      "Objectifs d'apprentissage":"The students will be introduced to the fundamental physical concepts involved in the description of optical and electronic transport properties of amorphous and disordered semiconductors. These materials are found in many large-area applications (macroelectronics) including solar cells, photo-detectors, flat panel displays, imagers, etc. Device physics of these main applications will be introduced."
