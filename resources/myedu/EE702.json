      "Content":"[li] Module 1: General Overview about SoC: MPSoC, homogeneous vs. heterogeneous. Current co-design frameworks of SoC for FPGAs and examples of actual SoC platforms.[br/][li] Module 2: Design of complete MPSoCs: Synthesizable processors, types of integrated memo-ries. Utilization of compiler/assembler for co-design and basic I/O.[br/][li] Module 3: Connection of custom VHDL blocks and Intellectural Property (IP) blocks in SoCs: Integration of own VHDL modules and IP blocks, connectivity of the blocks to on-chip buses and accessing the modules using C code in included processing cores.[br/][li] Module 4: Multi-programming: Integration of multiple processing cores in a single FPGA to create an MPSoC platform and how to program it.[br/][li] Module 5: Interconnection: Definition of SoC interconnects for FPGA-based implementations through hierarchies of buses and packet-based interconnects or Network-on-Chip (NoC).[br/][li] Module 6: Interaction with a personal computer (PC): Advanced communication buses be-tween FPGA-PC in real time (PCI, plug&play, etc.) and device controllers in Windows/Linux.[br/][br/]",
