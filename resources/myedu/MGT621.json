      "Content":"The course will introduce to the basic theory to examine how decisions and behaviors affect the supply and demand for goods and services, which dertemines prices; and how prices in turn determine the supply and demand of goods and services. The course will cover the basic assumptions and definitions, modes of operation, market failures, opportunity costs. It will go deeper to some cases of applied microeconomics dealing with innovation, consumer choices and firm strategies.",
