      "Learning outcomes":"Linear signal modeling and prediction has been a topic of intense theoretical and applied research in the last 30 years. It is at the core of modern speech analysis and synthesis techniques, as well as of many communication systems, to name the two principal application fields. There are however processes in biology, economy, astronomy, hydrology, ..., which are not well described by a linear model. This has triggered in the last 15 years a lot of interest for nonlinear models. Also, chaos theory, which has received much attention recently, is closely linked to nonlinear modeling. The purpose of this course is to introduce the students to the main issues in nonlinear modeling and prediction, and to indicate them the current research directions in this field.",
