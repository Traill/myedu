      "Learning outcomes":"The objective of the course is to expose PhD students to experimental measurement techniques and principles applied in front end research of condensed matter and nanophysics. The course is a block course of lectures with integrated lab instructions (36 hours) taking place during one week at the Max-Planck-Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany. Besides providing a solid background, it will focus on the crucial details which will make cutting edge experiments work, details which are usually not taught in text books",
