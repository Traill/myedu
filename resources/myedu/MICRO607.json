The course offers high-specialized lectures in the mornings, and hands-on experiences or visits to high-tech companies in the afternoons.[br/]A maximum of 30 students is accepted for the course. This number is set by the laboratories capacities: 6 students per laboratory. [br/]",
      "Content":"The course include lectures and laboratories on the following subjects: Micro-Optics, MEMS, 3D micro-machining, Microrobotics, Nanomaterials, Self-assembly processes, AFM, SEM, TEM... Other subjects are treated, which change every year. Each lecture lasts 2 hours and is given by a different professor. Students may choose 2 laboratories out of 5, each one lasting two af-ternoons. In addition, shorter workshops are  organized on micromachining, microrobotic, microassembly and microactuators.[br/]Two visits to High-Tech companies are organized.  [br/]",
