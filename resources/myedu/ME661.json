Mechanics of porous media play an important role in many branches of engineering, including material science, biomechanics and the petroleum industry, as well as in (geo-) mechanics.[br/]The objective of this interdisciplinary course is to formulate realistic analysis of the behaviour of multiphase porous material (solid, miscible and immiscible fluids) submitted to multiphysics phenomena (mechanics, hydraulic and thermal).[br/][br/]The course includes two main parts:[br/][br/]1) the constitutive behaviour of the porous solid matrix; and,[br/]2) the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical processes in saturated and unsaturated porous materials.[br/][br/]The constitutive behaviour for deformable porous media takes into account the non-linear thermo-elasto-visco-plastic aspects including hardening.[br/]The thermo-hydro-mechanical interactions are analysed using continuum mechanics theory, as they occur in soil and rock mechanics as well as in trabecular bone and porous membrane biomechanics.[br/]One of the challenges is to combine the non-linear behaviour of the solid matrix with the multiphysics processes occurring in the porous materials.",
