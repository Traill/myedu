      "Learning outcomes":"Much of the increase in business efficiency over the past 10-20 years can be attributed to technological applications such as bar-coding, RFID, computerized inventory systems, EDI, Internet ordering and exchange of forecasting information.  These technologies have made it possible to link business units within a single organization and distinct businesses that form component parts of a global supply chain.  While the potential of such technologies is enormous, so are the challenges involved in seamlessly integrating across organizations.[br/]\tThis seminar will examine supply chain research that focuses on the management of technological applications, with papers to be pulled from prestigious journals such as Management Science, Journal of Operations Management, Production and Operations Management and Decision Sciences.  The seminar will examine both effective management practices gleaned from the literature and research methodologies that have been employed.  In addition, one or two class periods will be spent analyzing and de-constructing supply chains of companies selected by the students in order to understand the component parts and interactions",
