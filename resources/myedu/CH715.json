      "Learning outcomes":"Centered around multiscale phenomena, Multiscale Modeling and Simulation (MMS) is an interdisciplinary numerical tool focusing on the fundamental modeling and computational principles underlying various numerical methods. Connections between various scales are currently achieved either by a parametrization or by a 'zoom-out' or 'coarse-graining' procedure.[br/]",
      "Content":"Several domains of modern computational science are converging on complex problems in the general field of nano-materials. Our strategy will be to build every more approximate method on the basis of the previous more accurate one. We will focus, in particular, on links between QM electronic-structure calculations at the finest molecular scale and equilibrium and non-equilibrium MM simulations to address mesoscopic system properties, using error control across the different scales. Indeed, at each scale, approximations are performed, that introduce uncertainty and bridging from one scale to another gives rise to additional uncertainty. Only error control will allow to propagate the QM accuracy, up the chain of methods, to successively increasing spatial and temporal scales. This means that, at every level of the successive methodologies, the accuracy has to be controlled on the same models and properties which have been treated with the previous more accurate tool.[br/]",
