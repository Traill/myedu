      "Learning outcomes":"The main goal of this course is to give the student a solid introduction into approaches, methods, and instrumentation used in biomedical research. A major focus is on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and related methods, but other imaging modalities will be increasingly covered",
      "Content":"Introduction (Bloch equations; Components of an MRI systems; Peamplifier, ADC;Longitudinal interference)[br/]MRI basics (Spin-warp imaging, slice selection, EPI;Fourier image reconstruction, zero-filling apodization; -space imaging strategies - what defines contrast;Gbbs ringing and other artefacts)[br/]Hardware of imaging (Gradient coils - eddy currents; Shimming: Theory of coil design, spherical harmonics; field mapping and shim methods)[br/]Localization methods for MRS (ISIS, PRESS, STEAMl;Chemical shift displacement error;Water suppression methods, fat suppression methods, dynamic range)[br/]Multinuclear MRS in an inhomogenous RF field (Localization methods (PT, DEPT, HH);Decoupling, WALTZ, adiabatic decoupling;Adiabatic RF pulses;Absolute quantification (water, external, internal))[br/]Moving magnetization (Artifact recognition - bases of artifacts; 2nd moment nulling, PC flow imaging, TOF; Triggering and synchronization)[br/]Diffusion MR(Stejskal-tanner, b value, Einstein-stokes relationship; Restricted vs. hindered diffusion; q-space imaging; DTI and fiber tracking)[br/]Perfusion imaging(Pulsed arterial spin labeling, FAIR, EPISTAR;Continuous arterial spin labeling)[br/]Magnetization transfer(MTC imaging, Solomon equations;Saturation transfer experiments)[br/]Rf coils(Theory of matching;Coil design surface coil TEM coil;Diel effects, coil loading and efficiency)[br/]Imaging sequences (STEAM, SE, FSE (CPMG), FLASH, SSFP)[br/]fMRI(BOLD effect, SE vs GE imaging;Pharmacological MRI;Biophysical basis)[br/]Modeling (Tracer kinetics;Uptake curves)",
      "Keywords":"spin physics, MRI, RF engineering",
      "Note":"Above program is preliminary and for the first year only. May change to include other modalities as well in future years",
      "Required prior knowledge":"Course(s) attended, equivalent to  the teaching of \"fundamentals of biomedical imaging\" or practical exposure to the topics covered in this cours as part of the PhD for at least 6 months. In other words, the student should be familiar with the basics of the imaging methodologies covered. "
