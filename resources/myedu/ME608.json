      "Content":"The following topics are covered:[br/]- Problem solutions in terms of series and asymptotic series[br/]- Ordering parameters and asymptotic analysis[br/]- Asymptotic approximation of integrals (methods of stationary phase and of steepest descent applied to Fourier inversions, etc.)[br/]- Singular perturbations - Matched asymptotic expansions (generalized boundary layer approximation) with examples (correction to Stokes drag of a sphere, etc.)[br/]- Multi-scale methods with examples (flows with \"slow\" streamwise evolution such as developed flow in a tube with variable properties, waves evolving in slowly varying media, etc.)[br/]",
