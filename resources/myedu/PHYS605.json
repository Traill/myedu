      "Learning outcomes":"Important progress has been achieved in the past few years in the basic understanding of photonic crystals which may lead to new breakthroughs in fields such as integrated optics, all optical communications systems and quantum information processing. The meeting will focus on bidimensional photonic crystal structures where physical understanding, modeling and development of new concepts for integrated optics devices have seen the most promising evolution over the last two years.[br/]Key issues that will be addressed include: modeling tools and their specificities and limitations, writing and etching tools for different material systems, comparison between wave guide and membrane approaches, new concepts and functionalities for passive and active devices (add/drop and input/output couplers, lasers), use of photonic crystals in the transmission mode (superlens, superprism), tunable photonic crystals, high Q cavities with photonic crystals for fundamental physics (Purcell effect, quantum optics, single photon sources ), non-linear optics in photonic crystals.[br/] ",
