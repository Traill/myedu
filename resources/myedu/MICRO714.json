The course aims to provide a theoretical background of microfluidics effects and concepts. After revising the fundamental equations that govern liquid flow in microchannels, most popular electrohydrodynamic effects (electroosmosis), as well as the effect of electrical or magnetic fields on microparticles suspended in solution will be discussed. Multiphase flow is also a topic in actual lab-on-a-chip developments that will be adressed in this course.
