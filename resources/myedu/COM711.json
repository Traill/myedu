      "Learning outcomes":"The goal of Computer vision is to process images acquired with cameras in order to produce a representation of objects in the world. Although there already exists a number of working systems that perform parts of this task in specialized domains,  the generic \"Vision Problem\" is far from being solved. No existing  system can come close to emulating the capabilities of a human.[br/][br/]The  aim of this  course is  to teach  the students  how to  reason in rigorous manner on Computer Vision  related problems. We will focus on a few subsets and study them  in depth. We will try to understand what makes Computer Vision so hard,  what is the state-of-the-art, and what are promising directions for future research.[br/][br/]",
