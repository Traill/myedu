      "Learning outcomes":"This class will provide an intensive introduction to quantitative research in the field of management of technology.  The course will include both discussion of major research methods and an intensive introduction to doing quantitative analysis.  Students will learn how to use common quantitative techniques including ANOVA, linear OLS regression, instrumental variables, hazard rate models, logistic regression.  Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis will be covered.  Problems of endogeneity and sample selection will be considered.  The course will provide knowledge of which tools are appropriate for what conditions.",
