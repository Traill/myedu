      "Learning outcomes":"Media security, while being a subset of data security, is of special interest for two main reasons. First, security applications involving media content are particularly rich in their technical challenges and business opportunities. Second, media content, as opposed to generic data, is intended for human consumption and therefore bears a perceptual dimension. Specifically, it is mostly the content, and not the data, that needs to be authenticated and/or protected. This brings additional degrees of freedom, as well as constraints on how such type of data can be secured."
