      "Learning outcomes":"The objective of the course is to teach PhD students the basic concepts of non-cooperative game theory (Nash equilibrium, subgame-perfect equilibrium, Bayesian equilibrium, perfect Bayesian equilibrium), so as to provide them with the appropriate tools for applications. ",
      "Content":"The course is divided into four parts: 1. Strategic form games; 2. Extensive form games with perfect information and repeated games; 3. Static games with incomplete information; 3. Dynamic games with imperfect and/or incomplete information ",

      "Required prior knowledge":"No prior knowledge of game theory is required to follow the course. However, familiarity with the basic concepts of analysis and probability is likely to be useful to the students.   "
