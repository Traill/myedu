      "Learning outcomes":"The course will introduce modern magnetic resonance experiments used to determine biomolecular structure and dynamics in solution. The objective is to explain the multi-nuclear techniques that lead to resonance assignment and structure calculation. The ways to validate an NMR structure and compare it with predictions from homology modelling based on sequence similarities will be explained. The students will become acquainted with the use of magnetic resonance in structural biology, learn how to assign NMR signals, calculate structural restraints, and study dynamic properties, including chemical exchange. These steps are essential for the study of structure-function relationships of biological macromolecules, an integral part of diverse chemical and biological research efforts. At the end of the course, the focus will be placed on hyperpolarisation, a sensitivity enhancement technique that is likely to become increasingly useful for biochemists.[br/]",
