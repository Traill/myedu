      "Learning outcomes":"The course teaches the acquisition of a methodology of designing experiments for optimal quality of the results and of the number of experiments. Specifically the objectives are:[br/][br/][li]To transfer to the student the conceptual basis for designing, performing and analyzing statistical design of experiments[br/][li]To let the student understand the methodology of response surface, with the mathematical concepts that allow the evaluation and the optimization of a matrix of experiments[br/][li]To develop a principle of know-how to evaluate, optimize and analyze design of experiments[br/][li]To develop conceptual understanding of the design of experiments that allows the PhD student to collaborate with statisticians",
