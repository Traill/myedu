      "Learning outcomes":"The aim of this course is to provide a presentation of main ideas, principles and theoretical bases of photovoltaic solar energy conversion. The parameters for application of photovoltaic energy conversion devices, including the electromagnetic and solar spectrum, basics of climatology as relevant for solar energy conversion and other environmental considerations will be  given attention. Fundamental concepts in photovoltaics technology, solid state photonics, electrochemistry and photochemistry will be presented and the exemplary case of molecular photovoltaic systems (dye sensitized nanocrystalline solar cells) more particularly studied. Materials of significance for photovoltaics and electrochemistry for  energy applications will be identifed, together with the structures of devices. Short hands-on experiments and demonstrations in research labs will help students grasping the physical phenomena taking place in systems of interest and understanding advanced strategies applied in technological developments.",
