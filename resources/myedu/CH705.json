      "Content":"The content will depend each year on the demand from the EPFL research groups in chemistry and biology to cover the current \"hot\" topics in advanced mass spectrometry applied to organic chemistry, metabolomics, proteomics and structural biology.Course program includes: mass spectrometry basics, bottom-up and top-down mass spectrometry for peptide and protein analysis, including characterization of post-translational modifications, protein quantification, protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions with a focus on modern MS/MS techniques - electron capture/transfer dissociation. The course includes practical work in mass spectrometry laboratories in the Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry Laboratory and Mass Spectrometry Service Facility of the EPFL.",
