      "Learning outcomes":"Inherent in the task of managers is decision making in a number of forms. In this course we address some fundamental issues in understanding and researching managerial decision making in the context of technology management and strategy.[br/][br/][li] the role of managerial decision making in an organizational context[br/][li] the nature of decision making as a human and organizational activity[br/][li] rational, behavioral, organizational, political, and other theoretical perspectives on the managerial decision-making process[br/][li] the different characteristics of decision making contexts and processes at the operational and strategic level of organizations [br/][li] the design of the distribution of decision making in organizations[br/][li] decision making in technology choice and implementation ",
      "Content":"Class #1[br/][br/]We begin this class with an exercise in managerial decision making and  subsequently analyze the exercise as a prelude to discussing the managerial decision making theories we consider in the course.[br/][br/]We then develop a perspective on the role and nature of managerial decision-making in organizations as human systems. We consider the fundamental elements of the Theory of Rational Decision Making (as elaborated in economic and decision analysis theory) as the intended \"ideal\" for managerial decision-making. We also consider the challenges and limitations in the implementation of rational decision making that are recognized in Cognitive Theories of managerial decision-making.[br/][br/]Readings:[br/]- Sanchez and Heene, Chapters 1 and 4: \"Designing and Managing [br/]   Organizations as Open Systems for Value Creation\"[br/]- Scott,  \"Organizations as Rational Systems\"[br/]- Bross,  \"Nature of Decision\"[br/]- Radner, \"Normative Theory of Individual Decision: An Introduction\"[br/]- Tversky and Kahneman, \"Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\"[br/][br/][br/]Class #2[br/]In this class we examine Behavioral, Organizational, Political, and Normative-Affective Theories of Managerial Decision Making and their implications for research into decisions affecting technology strategy and management.[br/]Readings:[br/]- Simon, \"A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice\"[br/]- Simon, \"Decision Making and Problem Solving\"[br/]- March and Shapira, \"Behavioral Decision Theory and Organizational Decision Theory\" [br/]- March and Shapira, \"Managerial Perspectives on Risk and Risk-Taking\"[br/]- March, \"The Business Firm as Political Coalition\"[br/]- Cohen, March, and Olsen, \"A Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice\"[br/]- Etzioni, \"Normative-Affective Factors: Toward a New Decision-Making Model\"[br/][br/][br/]Class #3[br/] [br/]In this class we examine the particular influences and challenges of Managerial Decision Making in strategic decision contexts. We consider the cognitive challenges and behavioral influences of strategic decision environments characterized by high levels of uncertainty and associated perceptions of risk in making decisions. We also consider managerial tendencies that arise in such contexts, and the kinds of management decision processes likely to arise under significant uncertainty and risk.[br/][br/]Readings:[br/]- Sanchez and Heene, Chapter 10 - \"Managing Managerial Cognition\"[br/]- Sanchez, \"Preparing for an Uncertain Future: Managing Organizations for [br/]   Strategic Flexibility\"[br/]- Salancik and Pfeffer, \"Who Gets Power -- And How They Hold on to It\"[br/]- Leonard and Strauss, \"Putting Your Company's Whole Brain to Work\"[br/]- Mintzberg et al., \"The Structure of 'Unstructured' Decision Processes\"[br/]- Schwenk, \"Cognitive Simplification Processes in Strategic Decision Making\"[br/]- Shrivastava, \"Variations in Strategic Decision-Making Processes\"\t[br/][br/][br/]Class #4[br/][br/]In this class we listen to and discuss some student presentations of the Decision Making Process Design assignment. [br/][br/]We also examine a selection of current research articles in technology management and strategy to clarify and evaluate their approaches to representing and researching managerial decision-making in the context of technology management and strategy decisions.[br/][br/]Decision Making Process Design Assignment:[br/]Class participants will be asked to prepare a process design for making a series of important decisions in a company. Students should submit a 5-page analysis of the process and be prepared to present up to 5 PowerPoint slides explaining their decision process designs.[br/]",
