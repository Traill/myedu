      "Learning outcomes":"A major function of the brain is to organise motor output and behaviour in a purposeful goal-oriented manner. One form of motivation is driven by rewards. Usually it is necessary to do something specific in order to obtain a reward, and during reward-based learning animals as-sociate specific sensory inputs with prediction of award availability. In this course we will study the current hypotheses of reward-based associative learning and how this might be imple-mented in the mammalian brain. Having learnt basic rules of how to obtain rewards, in any given situation an animal must make decisions on what it should do. Reward-based learning and decision making therefore are closely linked and we shall examine their neural bases.[br/]",
      "Content":"The course will combine formal presentations together with informal discussions that aim to develop new ideas. We will focus on experimental neurophysiology of: 1. Dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain, which are thought to be involved in reward prediction errors. 2. Neural correlates of decision making in behaving monkeys and rodents based on tactile stimuli.[br/]",
      "Note":"Maximum 10 students will be able to attend this class.[br/]",
      "Required prior knowledge":"This is an advanced neuroscience course.[br/]"
