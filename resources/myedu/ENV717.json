      "Learning outcomes":"Providing the students with some more in-depth background on landscape and ecosystem assessments, in particular on how to measure biological changes in ecosystems. The students will get acquainted with different approaches used in field ecology to measure changes in biological populations and communities. They will learn about the constraints related to various ecological measurements and how to select the appropriate methodology regarding ecological questions. The course will also give the students the opportunity to do a field study, including data collection on vegetation and soil,and statistical multivariate analyses.There will be a focus on ecosystems sensitive to human activities.",
