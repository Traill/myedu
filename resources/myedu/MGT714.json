      "Learning outcomes":"This course is as a Ph.D. seminar in entrepreneurship.  The focus is on theory building and empirical testing of the factors shaping the identification, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities and the creation of new organizations.  The objective of the course is to give students an introduction to the major theoretical threads and controversies in the field. It will also examine the methodologies that are important to research in this area. Students will learn about various perspectives, examine different methodologies, explore some original empirical research, make connections between theory and empirical research, and practice critiquing and identifying insight in research.  These skills are important preconditions to developing one's own original ideas."
