      "Learning outcomes":"The aim of the course is to provide the students with some selected topics in various areas of electromagnetic compatibility. As part of the final examination, each graduate student will be assigned a mini research project, and will be expected to develop and present a lecture on this topic. The graduate student lectures will be presented to the instructor and interested classmates. Each lecture will last approximately 30 minutes.  Each student will present the talk as a PowerPoint presentation, or equivalent, and these (or a written report) will be made available to the class to support their lecture. ",
