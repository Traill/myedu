Over the past decade, seeing the brain at work has had a tremendous impact on neurosciences and medicine. The essentials of signal and image processing methods that lead to successful interpretation of functional brain imaging data are described, with a particular emphasis on multivariate techniques that jointly consider signals from various spatial positions.
