      "Content":"After a summary in basic accelerator physics, new concepts will be discussed of accelerators for research and application. This includes proposed machines for High Energy Physics which are hadron colliders with very high energies (VHLC), electron-positron linear colliders (EuroTeV, CLIC), neutrino factories and muon colliders. The advantages and challenges of the different concepts will be compared. [br/]In a second step, accelerators will be discussed which are more oriented towards applied research, as neutron spallation sources and synchrotron light sources. In the latter group also the most recent developments in the field of Free Electron Lasers (FELs) are included.[br/]Finally new developments of accelerators for medical applications are discussed.[br/][br/]The second element of this course will be an introduction to the techniques of accelerator design. A computer code will be made available to the candidates that allows designing an accelerator magnet structure and to evaluate its performance with regard to linear and nonlinear particle dynamics. It is planned that the candidates work out a project in groups that concludes with a written report on these theoretical studies.[br/][br/]",
