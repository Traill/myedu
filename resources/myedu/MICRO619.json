Application of micro- and nanotechnology to the development of distributed, scaled micro-power systems, PowerMEMS, will produce systems that hopefully save energy and preserve the environment. [br/]The course will cover the main aspects related to application of micro and nanotechnology for generation of power and energy conversion with a strong focus on energy harvesting and scavenging. The student will acquire knowledge on the benefits of micro and nanotechnology for power generation and energy conversion, on the main types of PowerMEMS devices and on the maturity of these different technologies.
