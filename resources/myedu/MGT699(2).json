      "Learning outcomes":"The Swiss Program for Beginning Doctoral Students in Economics consists of a mathematics review (two days, optional) as well as sequences in microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics. In each sequence, leading international academics teach four week-long courses.[br/][br/]Each course includes formal lectures of three hours per day as well as exercise review sessions. Course weeks start on Monday at 10:30h and end on Friday at noon. Returning to their home universities in the periods between the course weeks, participants review and prepare the material covered in class, solve mandatory homework problem sets, and study for the midterm and final exams. On successful completion of the program, participants are awarded a Certificate. "
