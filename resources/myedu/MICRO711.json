      "Learning outcomes":"The course aims to provide basic knowledge about RF MEMS and their role in communications applications. The technology, device architecture and principle, design, simulation and modeling, are presented with examples from state-of-the-art. Designs of RF ICs with MEMS, resulting in novel functionality and performance, are presented. A particular focus is on the MEMS resonator technology and its hybridization with CMOS. The scaling of MEMS resonators is particularly discussed. The lecture also adresses packaging and reliability issues of RF MEMS de-vices. Finally, the potential of Carbon Nanotube technology for RF NEMS is discussed.",
