      "Learning outcomes":"The penetration of renewable energy sources (RERs) in the various levels of electrical power grids has exponentially increased in the last decade. The inherent decentralized nature of RERs is resulting in a progressive change of operation and control philosophies of both grids and sources. Within this context, the decentralization of energy sources and the increase of so-called micro-grids gave rise to a systematic use of active power converters. In order to improve the efficiency of energy conversion systems and the quality of the injected power to the grid, one has to implement innovative methods for synchronizing the power converters to single phase or three phase networks. As a matter of facts, in the application field of electric drives connecting generators and/or motors to networks of various sizes, the industry requires more and more robustness regarding network unbalance and sags, involving a special development effort on the control itself.[br/]This lecture aims at offering an extensive overview of modern control methods for the connection of power inverters to any kind of grids. The covered topics refer to single and three phase networks synchronization, current control and application in real networks. A large part of the course is expected to take place in computer labs in order to improve the understanding of the covered topics.[br/]",
