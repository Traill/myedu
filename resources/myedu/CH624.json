[br/]In particular, symmetry theory, diffraction theory, direct methods (including charge flipping), the heavy atom-method, refinement and data treatment shall be taught at a moderately advanced level, [br/]but without requiring prior knowledge. Some importance shall be given to proficiency in using the International Tables for Crystallography, the pertinent data bases, the crystallographic literature and preparing CIF-files."
