      "Objectifs d'apprentissage":"The objectives of this course are to present the major elements of traffic operations and to develop basic skills in applying the fundamentals of traffic analysis and control. By the end of this course, students should be able to start applying these skills to model different aspects of congestion in urban transportation systems and develop elegant control strategies to improve mobility in cities. The students are also prepared for further study in this field. The course does not cover all aspects of traffic engineering, operations and control.  The kinds of recipes found in handbooks, for example, are de-emphasized.  Priority is given instead to logic; i.e., ways of thinking about problems that commonly arise in transportation operations so as to obtain suitable solutions.  The ideas covered here are those that, by virtue of their grounding in physical reality, are most likely to stand the test of time."
