Students will read, present, and discuss results from the most recent major cryptology conferences (such as Crypto and Eurocrypt) and explore ways to improve those results. A particular focus will be the study and development of new results related to cryptographic hash functions with properties that can be proved based on common mathematical hardness assumptions or on properties of underlying block ciphers. The course is intended to stimulate students in their own research.",
