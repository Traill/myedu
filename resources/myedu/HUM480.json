      "Learning outcomes":"Social and political change, but also economic growth, improvements in productivity and the diffusion of technological innovations, can only be properly understood in their broader context, including social organization, economic relations and political culture. The aim of the first module of the EPFL Minor in Area and Cultural Studies is therefore to introduce the students to the societies and civilizations of Asia and the Middle East and to unravel some of the major issues affecting the social, cultural and political landscapes of these countries.",
      "Content":"The course will start with three sessions devoted to the theoretical framework of area and cultural studies, in order to provide the relevant tools deriving from cultural studies that will be used in the Minor. Three geographical areas will then be covered: East Asia, South Asia and the Middle East. The course will concentrate on contemporary processes and issues within single nations or sub-regions but it will also address, to some extent, cross-border exchanges and influences. Each session will explore a specific issue of particular relevance to the nation or the region considered. The classes will usually be divided into a two-hour lecture and a one-hour discussion, using also some reading material to be circulated in advance.",
