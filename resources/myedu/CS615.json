      "Learning outcomes":"The Internet has changed the way people perceive computers, communicate and do business. A key component of many successful Internet applications is a scalable, high-performance, and highly-available distributed system.  For example, large clusters of computers provide services for popular Web sites. Moreover, As the planetary-scale services and the cloud computing paradigm grow in importance, it becomes necessary to understand the networked systems underpinnings that will enable the future applications. This is a networked systems course with an experimental systems viewpoint: the course will discuss the architecture and teach the understanding of the performance of real systems. The syllabus for this research-oriented course is driven by published papers, both classic and current. After completing the course, the students should be able to engage in doctoral-level research in this field. Paper evaluations that demand critical reasoning will be a part of the grade. Students will also be expected to present up to two research papers and they will be graded on the quality of the presentation. There will be a midterm and a final group project report, with a goal of publishing the best projects in top conferences (with additional work).[br/]",
