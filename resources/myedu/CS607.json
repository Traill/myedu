      "Learning outcomes":"The aim of machine learning is to extract knowledge from data. The algorithm may be informed by incorporating prior knowledge of the task at hand. The amount of information varies from fully supervised to unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. This course will present some of the core advanced methods in the field for structure discovery, classification and non-linear regression. This is an advanced class in Machine Learning; hence, students are expected to have some background in the field. The class will be accompanied by practical session on computer, using the mldemos software (http://mldemos.epfl.ch) that encompasses more than 30 state of the art algorithms.",
