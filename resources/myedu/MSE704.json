      "Learning outcomes":"Understand the principles of 3D surface (SEM) and volume (SEM/FIB and TEM) reconstruction by electron microscopy. Know the possibilities and limitations of the different techniques for materials science applications.[br/][br/]Introduction: [br/]Electron microscopes deliver only 2D information in a single image. The 3rd dimension is often left to the interpretation by the observer. Different techniques have been developed to use 2 or more images to reconstruct the 3rd dimension. To investigate and analyze the complex structures produced by micro- and nano-technology 3D electron microscopy is offering power-ful methods. The resolution of modern electron microscopes and the possibility to choose between different signals make them versatile tools for the exploration of the micro- and nano-cosmos.[br/]",
