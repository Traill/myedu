      "Learning outcomes":"This doctoral course presents the foundational features of the philosophy of science as a fundamental approach to building \"warranted belief\" -- i.e., to theory building -- in the field of management studies, with special reference to theoretical issues, empirical challenges, and research topics in the area of technology management and strategy. The course is intended to serve as the foundation for further courses in research methods, and to assist doctoral in developing defensible dissertation research designs.   [br/]Two assignments undertaken during the October and November and 2012 classes provide opportunities to apply the concepts presented in the course to the analysis of important research papers in the field of technology strategy and management. In addition, two assignments in February and March 2013 will give students opportunities to define and present actual or possible dissertation research designs and to receive and respond to constructive feedback on their proposed research designs. [br/]\tThe course will have 64 hours of seminar time, divided into eight full-day class meetings, four of which will be in October/November 2012 and four of which will be in February/March 2013.[br/]",
      "Content":"Class #1, 29 October 2012, 9am-5pm [br/]Foundations of the scientific method as a process for establishing warranted belief[br/][br/]In the first session of the class, we investigate the ontological, phenomenological, and epistemological foundations of the scientific method. We develop the conceptual definitions of and delineate the interrelationships among observed phenomena, scientific theories intended to explain those phenomena, models derived from theories, hypotheses derived from models, and constructs used in testing hypotheses used in research designs. We discuss the fundamental importance of developing conceptually clear and adequate definitions of terms used in theories and models, and of the constructs used in hypotheses and measures. We also discuss fundamental approaches to measuring constructs and representing relationships between constructs. We then clarify the logic that underlies the building of \"warranted belief\" through the process of experiments and attempted falsification in the two contexts of physical science and management research. We identify and explore some special challenges in using the methods of science to build normative theory in management studies.[br/][br/]Class # 2, 30 October 2012, 9am-5pm[br/]Concepts, constructs, and modes of measuring in research designs[br/][br/]We elaborate the critical relationships between the concepts used to represent phenomena in theory and the constructs that are used to represent theoretical concepts in empirical research. We consider the ways in which the concepts on which theory is based determine the possibilities for the measurement of the phenomena represented by those concepts. We then investigate the process of empirically driven processes for developing concepts, models, and theories; in effect, we examine the possibility of building as well as testing theory through empiricism (i.e., reversing the logical progression in our initial discussion of the scientific process). We discuss the possibility of conducting \"theory-free\" grounded research, and we examine the validity of dichotomizing research into \"quantitative\" and \"qualitative\" research methods.[br/][br/]First assignment: Participants will be asked to analyze and critique the use of the scientific method in a well-known paper in the field of technology management. [br/][br/]Class #3, 14 November 2012a, 9am-5pm [br/]Current approaches and issues in technology management research[br/][br/]The class begins with presentation and discussion of the first assignment.[br/]This class then applies the scientific process framework developed in Classes #1 and #2 to the identification of key issues in defining research designs in technology management and strategy.[br/][br/]Second assignment: Participants will be asked to define and compare the research designs used in two representative papers in the fields of technology management and strategy.[br/][br/]Class #4, 26 November 2012,  9am-5pm [br/]The Social Embeddedness of the Scientific Process[br/][br/]The class begins with presentations and discussion of the second assignment.[br/]The class then discusses the ways in which the process of science is embedded in social institutions and communities of practice, and the implications of the social context of science for the theory building process and the publication of research in technology management and strategy.[br/][br/]Third Assignment: Participants will be asked to prepare a 10-page description of their (actual or possible) dissertation research designs, prepare PowerPoint slides for a 20-30 minute presentation of the research design, and prepare to answer questions about their research designs during the fifth and sixth classes in March 2012.[br/][br/]Classes #5 #6 #7 and #8, February-March 2013[br/]The class will consist of presentations, critiques, and discussion of participants (actual or possible) dissertation research designs.[br/][br/]Fourth assignment",
