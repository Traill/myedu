      "Learning outcomes":"Contemporary datacenters are warehouse-scale computers with tens of thousands of servers and multi-megawatt power budgets, running today's most demanding online services (e.g., Google search, Facebook, YouTube). In this course, students we will survey a broad and comprehensive spectrum of design topics in modern datacenters including infrastructure, server hardware, networking and storage technologies. Students will also understand the implications of warehouse-scale computing on software, including programming models, databases, file systems, and resource management. Finally, the course will cover a number of cross-cutting issues, such as quality-of-service, energy-efficiency, and TCO (total cost of ownership)",
      "Content":"The course wil use the primer from ClayPool lecture series on Warehouse-Scale Computing by Barrosso and Hoelzle, and technical research papers from recent years in venues corresponding to the topic. The course will be run as a seminar series with student presentations followed by an in-class discussion. The students will be graded based on presentations and short reviews written for each reading assignment.[br/][br/]Datacenter basics: computing at scale of tens of thousands of servers[br/]Quality of service, energy proportionality and total cost of ownership[br/]Workloads[br/]Programming paradigms[br/]System software[br/]Virtualization[br/]Networking[br/]Storage systems[br/]Processors and memory systems[br/]Resource management[br/]Infrastructure: power distribution and cooling[br/]",
