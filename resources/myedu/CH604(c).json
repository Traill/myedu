      "Learning outcomes":"Presentation of the approaches used in biomedical research to define a potential target for the treatment of human diseases, of the problems to solve and of the experimental methods used to evaluate synthetic molecules. The goal will be to present a few examples, focusing on cancer, of the ways targets for drugs are defined, and how synthetic molecules are tested using biomedical models. The students will participate in the evaluation of experimental molecules in cell cultures in a biomedical research laboratory and will be commented evaluation of human surgical specimens by histological techniques to define drug targets.",
