      "Learning outcomes":"This course objective is to bridge between the world of technology and that of circuit and system design. It would be useless today to develop a record rapid devices if millions of them are not matching all identical characteristics. Equally useless would be designing a circuit that cannot be realized technologically. Whereas in the past technology was exclusively driven by the quest for performance, it is today driven even more by low power considerations, leakage, parasitics, variability, manufacturability, etc. Therefore, both technologists and designers need to learn about these problems and prepare for developing new solutions. An enormous R&D effort and founds have been invested by the industry to develop new technological and design/system solutions that will be explained, discussed and analyzed in this course.[br/]",
