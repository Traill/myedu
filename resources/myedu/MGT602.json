      "Content":"This course covers recent research and advances in operations and supply chain management. The objective of the course is to introduce Ph.D. students with the foundations of supply chain management modeling and to familiarize them with some of the latest research in this area. Special emphasis will be placed on research that has been conducted on supply chains for bringing technology products to markets whenever applicable. The course should be of particular interest for students who are currently pursuing doctoral studies at the junction of technology management and supply chain management, or related fields. In addition, it should appeal to students who are interested in the quantitative analysis of operations and supply chains. ",
