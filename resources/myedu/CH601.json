      "Learning outcomes":"The primary intention is to teach PhD students and post-docs so that they can benefit from the NMR spectrometers available at EPFL, and to give them a sound foundation in NMR for various applications in organic and inorganic chemistry. PhD students and post-docs who have followed the course successfully should be able to perform standard NMR experiments independently. They should also be able to help colleagues in various research groups who wish to use NMR.[br/]Passing the theoretical and practical exams will give 2 credits to PhD students.[br/]",
      "Content":"Basic theoretical and experimental aspects of NMR will be taught. Students will be familarized  with modern NMR spectrometers (shimming, locking, tuning, pulse length determination etc). Furthermore they will learn basic NMR experiments: 1H and 13C NMR, different decoupling schemes, relaxation measurements, spin echo techniques, coherence transfer experiments (INEPT), etc. NMR of quadrupolar nuclei and of nuclei with low sensitivity will be treated.[br/]",
      "Keywords":"NMR[br/]",
      "Note":"The course \"Basic and Advanced NMR - Part 1\" will comprise a theoretical part with mainly ex-cathedra teaching, and practical exercises on research NMR spectrometers. The course will be organized annually during the break between autumn and spring semester in January/February. Participation in the practical work will be limited to 12 participants. Four groups of three participants will be accompanied by an assistant and practice on all 4 spectrometers in turn.  [br/]",
