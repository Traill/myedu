      "Content":"I. Nucleation and growth of thin films by Prof. Patrik Hoffmann (Empa/EPFL) - 4x50 min[br/]Group exercises & presentations on the topic of the day - 3 groups of participants; tutor Prof. Patrik Hoffmann - 3x50min[br/][br/]II. Film structure by Prof. Alex Dommann (CSEM) - 4x50 min[br/][br/]III. Mechanical properties of thin films by Prof. Alex Dommann (CSEM) - 4x50 min[br/]Group exercises & presentations on the topic of this day and day before - 3 groups of participants; tutor Prof. Alex Dommann - 3x50 min[br/][br/]IV. Physical properties of thin films by Prof. Paul Muralt (EPFL) - 4x50 min[br/]Group exercises & presentations on the topic of the day - 3 groups of participants; tutor Prof. Paul Muralt - 3x50 min[br/][br/]V. Emerging thin films technologies [br/]-  Pulsed laser deposition of oxides for energy applications by Dr. Thomas Lippert (PSI/ETHZ) - 1x50 min[br/]-  Laser-induced forward transfer of \"sensitive\" materials by Dr. Thomas Lippert (PSI/ETHZ) - 1x50 min[br/]-  Synthesis of nanowires and related heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy by Prof. Anna Fontcuberta I Morral (EPFL) - 2x50 min[br/]",
      "Note":"Please note that the hours under \"Total hours per instructor\" have been calculated using 50-minute periods instead of 45.
