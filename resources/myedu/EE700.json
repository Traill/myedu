Object identification and classification; classes and categories; the importance of tasks on categorization; taxonomies. The importance of semantic verbal attributes.[br/]3. Spatial perception: visual recognition of outdoor and indoor scenes. Gist representations and object banks. Semantic space representation for robot localization. Place recognition versus place categorization.[br/]4. Human action recognition. Manipulation actions and the importance of joint recognition of manipulated objects. Affordances.[br/]5.
