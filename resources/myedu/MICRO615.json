      "Learning outcomes":"The student will gain a fundamental understanding of the principal mechanical and electrical failure modes of a variety of microsystems. He/She will learn how to accelerate those failures, and hence predict and improve the lifetime of microsystems. The student will adopt a design-for-reliability approach by concurrently developing design, fabrication, and packaging strategies to maximize the reliability of a microsystem.",

[br/][li] Electrical Reliability of MEMS: Open and short circuits, dielectric charging and breakdown, corrosion, ESD, electromigration. Reliability in the microelectronics field will presented and contrasted with reliability in microsystems.
