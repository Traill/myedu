In this context, the queue- length based Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) scheduling algorithms have attracted signiﬁcant attention because of their attractive throughput guarantees. However, the CSMA results rely on the mixing of the underlying Markov chain and their performance under fading channel states is unknown.\nIn this work, we formulate a partially decentralized random- ized scheduling algorithm for a two transmitter receiver pair set up and investigate its stability properties. Our work is based on the Fast-CSMA (FCSMA) algorithm ﬁrst developed in [1] and we extend its results to a signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) based interference model in which one or more transmitters can transmit simultaneously while causing interference to the other. In order to improve the performance of the system, we split the trafﬁc arriving at the transmitter into schedule based queues and combine it with the FCSMA based scheduling algorithm. We theoretically examine the performance of our algorithm in both non-fading and fading environment and characterize the set of arrival rates which can be stabilized by our proposed algorithm."},"body":{"text":"We consider the problem of decentralized channel access for the two user interference channel. Classical information theoretic approach assumes that the transmitters are always saturated with information bits. However, in this work, we consider the randomness in arrival of information bits and hence account for the queuing backlog at the transmitters. We consider that the transmission rates of each transmitter-receiver pair are a function of the signal to interference ration (SINR) at the receiver.\nThe work in this paper is comparable to the stream of works related to scheduling algorithms in wireless networks which operate at the packet level and assume that a ﬁxed number of packets can be transmitted per time slot . The task then is to schedule a set of non-conﬂicting links for transmission (conﬂict graph based interference model) in order to ensure the long term stability of the associated queues in the network. The authors in the seminal work of [2] devel- oped a maximum-weight based scheduling strategy which is proved to be throughput-optimal. However, the max-weight based algorithms are centralized in nature and suffer from high computational complexity. Subsequently low-complexity, decentralized, and possibly suboptimal scheduling algorithms were developed in series of works [3],[4],[5] with varying\ncomplexities and performances. In particular, recently a class of randomized scheduling algorithms namely the CSMA- based scheduling algorithms ([6],[7],[8]) have received a lot of attention because of their attractive throughput guarantees and distributiveness. However, the CSMA based scheduling algorithms rely on the mixing of the underlying Markov chain which cannot be guaranteed in a fading environment. Hence their performance in fading environment is not known.\nSpeciﬁcally, we develop a FCSMA (Fast-CSMA) based scheduling algorithm that extends the earlier results to the SINR-based interference model. 1 . The FCSMA operation has advantage over the CSMA based scheduling algorithms under fading conditions in that it quickly reaches one of the favorable schedules and sticks to it rather than relying on the conver- gence of the underlying Markov chain . Hence, the FCSMA based algorithm can perform well under fading environment as well.\nWe ﬁrst note that the straightforward application of FCSMA to the SINR based interference model has a low performance. In order to improve the performance of this scheme, we formulate a dynamic rule to split the incoming trafﬁc into schedule based queues at the transmitters and combine it with the FCSMA scheduling. By favorably tuning the control parameter of the trafﬁc splitting rule, we prove that the FCSMA based algorithm along with the appropriate trafﬁc splitting rule can provide a good performance.\nFinally, we would like to mention reference [9] a de- centralized queue-length dependent probabilistic scheduling algorithm for the two user multi-access channel. However, the analysis of the algorithm is done assuming that the channel realization stays constant through out and hence assumes a non-fading scenario. In contrast, we analyze our system under fading environment as well.\nWe consider a set up in which two transmitters (Tx) are trying to communicate to their respective receivers (Rx) over a common frequency band. We assume that the system operates in a time slotted fashion. We denote A i [t] as the amount of information bits that ﬂow into the Tx i during each time slot t. The arrival process is assumed to be independent across the\nusers and identically distributed over time slots with a rate of λ i , i = 1, 2, and A i [t] ≤ K, ∀t, for some 0 < K < ∞. Accordingly, there is queue associated with Tx i whose queue- length at time slot t is denoted by the notation Q i [t]. Let S i [t] denote the number of information bits served from the queue of Tx i during the time slot t. The equation for the queue-length evolution is given by\nwhere U i [t] denotes the unused service, 0 < U i [t] ≤ 1 if user i is selected for service and Q i [t] ≤ 1, U i [t] = 0 otherwise. We say that a queue is stable if lim sup T →∞ 1 T T −1 t =0 E [Q i [t]] < ∞.\nWe consider the SINR based interference model in which one or more transmitters can transmit simultaneously. In this case, the maximum achievable transmission rate for any Tx-Rx depends on the SINR at the Rx. In general, the transmission rate for a Tx-Rx pair during any time slot can be chosen from a continuous set. However, in order to simplify the analysis, we allow two levels of rates for every Tx-Rx pair. First, a rate of R i when only one of the two transmitters is transmitting (while the other transmitter is turned off) and a rate r i when both the transmitters are transmitting simultaneously (in which case, they cause interference to each other). These rates correspond to the three possible scheduling decisions in the set Ω = {ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 } where the rates obtained in the three scheduling decisions are given by {R 1 , 0}, {0, R 2 }, {r 1 , r 2 } respectively. A reasonable assumption is that the maximum achievable rate is an increasing function of the SINR. Hence, we assume that the rates r 1 ≤ R 1 and r 2 ≤ R 2 . The stability region for this system can be given as the convex hull of the possible transmission rates.\nThe stability region of the system is shown in Figure 1. Additionally, we note the condition r 1 R\n≥ 1, which ensures that the stability region goes beyond the time sharing region.\nThe objective of this work is to design a decentralized throughput optimal scheduling algorithm in which the trans- mitters cannot exchange the full channel state information (CSI) of the user terminals (UTs).\nThe FCSMA based scheduling algorithm operates in the following way. At the beginning of time slot t, each Tx independently generates two timers whose values are an expo- nentially distributed random variable with mean Q i [t]R i and Q i [t]r i respectively. These timers correspond to the respective scheduling decisions in which the Tx i can achieve a non zero rate. We assume that each Tx maintains a one bit index for the timers associated with it. Let us assume that the index of 0 corresponds to the timer Q i [t]R i and an index of 1 indicates that timer Q i [t]r i .\nThe system has four timers. Without the loss of generality, assume that one of the timers associated with Tx 1 expires ﬁrst among the four timers. The algorithm operates in the following manner. Tx 1 immediately suspends its second timer (which has not yet expired) and starts to transmit bits from its queue at the appropriate rate (rate R 1 if timer 0 expires or a rate r 1 if timer 1 expires). Tx 1 communicates the index of timer which has expired to Tx 2 . Upon receiving the index bit, Tx 2 also suspends both its timers. We assume the following pre- agreed protocol between the two Txs. Upon reception of the index 0, the Tx 2 keeps silent during corresponding time slot t. Upon reception of the index 1, the Tx 2 transmits from its queue at the rate r 2 . We ignore the overhead associated with communicating the bit between the two Txs. The state diagram for the FCSMA based scheduling algorithm is shown in Figure 2 and the probabilities of reaching each of the three possible schedules during a time slot t are given by\nQ k (R k + r k ) (2)\nAdditionally, the expected value of service rate for the queue at Tx i during the time slot t can be given by\nProposition 1. Consider a 2-user perfectly symmetric network in which R 1 = R 2 = 1 and r 1 = r 2 = α. (Note 0.5 ≤ α ≤ 1.) When the mean rate of the arrival process into the two Txs are the same (i.e., λ 1 = λ 2 = λ), the maximum arrival rate which can be supported by the FCSMA scheduling algorithm is given by\n2(α + 1) \t (4) The proof proceeds by considering a quadratic Lyapunov\nfunction of the form V (Q[t]) = 1 2 Q 2 1 [t] + Q 2 2 [t] and examining the value of λ for which the Lyapunov drift is negative outside a bounded set. The proof has been omitted for the lack for space. The reader can refer to [10].\nRemarks on the FCSMA algorithm: The FCSMA based scheduling algorithm described above is a partially decentral- ized algorithm in which the Txs exchange one bit information (index of the timer that expires ﬁrst). This calls for a sub- stantially less overhead of information exchange between the Txs as compared to exchanging the full CSI. From the plot of the stability region in Figure 1, notice that the maximum achievable rate in the symmetric case λ 1 = λ 2 = λ is λ < α (any arrival rate arbitrarily close to λ can be stabilized). However, the bound speciﬁed in (4) is lesser than α.\nIn what follows, we overcome this problem by combining the FCSMA scheduling scheme with a dynamic trafﬁc splitting algorithm. The main idea behind splitting the incoming trafﬁc is to modify the scheduling probabilities of the FCMSA algorithm in a such a way that the service rates adapt to the incoming trafﬁc arrival rate appropriately.\nIn this section, we introduce the concept of schedule based queues to split the input trafﬁc arriving into the Txs. Each Tx maintains two different queues one for each scheduling decision. For the Tx i , the queue Q ii corresponds to the ﬁrst scheduling decision in which the Tx i can transmit at the higher rate R i . When selected for service, this queue gets a service rate of R i . Let us deﬁne ¯i = mod (i, 2) + 1. The second queue Q i¯ i corresponds to the scheduling decision in which both the Txs have joint access to the channel and when selected for service, gets a rate of r i . The trafﬁc splitting policy can be described as follows. During the time slot t, each transmitter compares the current queue-lengths Q ii [t] and δ i Q i¯ i [t] where δ i ≥ 0 is a scaling factor. If Q ii [t] < δ i Q i¯ i [t], the information bits arriving in the respective slot enter the queue Q ii and vice versa. Accordingly,\nThe scheduling algorithm is exactly the same as the FCSMA algorithm described in Section II B except that the two timers\nassociated with the Tx i are exponential random variables with mean Q ii [t]R i and Q i¯ i [t]r i respectively (note that the queue-length values associated with the two mean values are different). The probabilities of each scheduling decision in this case are\nHaving deﬁned a dynamic trafﬁc splitting policy described above, the next task is to examine theoretically the set of arrival rates which can be stabilized by our algorithm. To this end, we deﬁne a Lyapunov function and examine its properties for different values of the queue-lengths. In order to make things more amenable for theoretical analysis, we restrict our proofs to a perfectly symmetric system model.\nTheorem 2. Consider a 2-user perfectly symmetric network described in Proposition 1. When the mean rate of the arrival process into the two transmitters are the same (i.e., λ 1 = λ 2 = λ), the maximum arrival rate which can be supported by the trafﬁc splitting policy described in equation (5) followed by the FCSMA scheduling algorithm is given by\nProof: For the lack of space, we provide only a brief sketch of the proof here. The detailed version of the proof can be found in [10]. Consider the Lyapunov function given by\nwhere ¯i = mod (i, 2) + 1. Our approach to ﬁnding the maximum supportable rate is to examine the drift of the Lyapunov function and determine the maximum value of the arrival rate λ for which the Lyapunov drift is negative outside a bounded region around the origin. In doing so, we bound the Lyapunov function by a series of upper bounds and take the most restrictive condition on the arrival rate λ. Recall that the queue-length evolution is given by\nThe Lyapunov drift is given by ∆V (Q[t]) = E [V (Q[t + 1]) − V (Q[t])|Q[t] = Q] where Q \t = [Q 11 , Q 12 , Q 21 , Q 22 ] T . Applying mean value theorem,\nThe analysis of the expression of ∆V (Q[t]) can be broken down into the following parts,\nwhere K, ǫ are bounded constants (see [10]). For the lack of space, we only consider the analysis of the term\nand show that ∆V 5 [t] (which loosely represents the Lyapunov drift in continuous time) is negative for all values of the queue- lengths. Every other term in the analysis of the Lyapunov drift can be bounded (please see [10]).\nwhere B (Q) = Q 11 + α(Q 12 + Q 21 ) + Q 22 . Depending on the relationship between the queue lengths, we consider four cases for the Lyapunov function (refer to the equation (5)).\nOur approach is the following. We examine the behavior of the function f 1 (Q) with respect to the variables Q 12 and Q 21 for a ﬁxed value of Q 11 and Q 22 . By considering the gradient of the function f 1 (Q) with respect to the variables Q 12 and Q 21 , for a ﬁxed value of Q 11 and Q 22 , it can be show that f 1 (Q) is a decreasing function of both Q 12 and Q 21 . Therefore for a\ngiven value of Q 11 and Q 22 , the function f 1 (Q) is maximized when δQ 12 = Q 11 and δQ 21 = Q 22 (hitting the boundary conditions of case 1). Therefore,\nwhere (a) follows from the following inequality (see [10] for details). For x, y, β 1 , β 2 ≥ 0,\nThe condition β 1 ≥ 0 implies that λ ≥ α 2 α +δ . Note that Q 11 ≥ 0 and Q 22 ≥ 0. Rearranging the term inside the brackets of (12), it can be veriﬁed that\n2(α + δ) \t (14) Notice that the range of λ speciﬁed in (13) is just a sufﬁcient condition f 1 (Q) ≤ 0. We now claim that\n2(α + δ) (15) We justify our claim in the following way. Let us deﬁne the upper bound on λ in (15) as λ max . Notice the expression for f 1 (Q) in equation (11) is an increasing function of λ for a ﬁxed value of the queue-length. Therefore, f 1 (Q) λ ≤\n≤ 0 for λ ≤ λ max and hence the claim of (15). Notice that the bound of (15) was obtained considering\na ﬁxed value of Q 11 and Q 22 . However, the argument is true for any positive value of Q 11 and Q 22 . Hence repeating the arguments for any Q 11 and Q 22 , we conclude that the Lyapunov drift is negative for all positive values of queue- lengths and λ ≤ λ max . Similarly we have three more cases to analyze.\nCase2: Q 11 ≥ δQ 12 ; Q 22 ≥ δQ 21 . Case3: Q 11 ≥ δQ 12 ; Q 22 ≤ δQ 21 . Case4: Q 11 ≤ δQ 12 ; Q 22 ≥ δQ 21 .\nBy writing the expression for the Lyapunov drift appropriately in each case and analyzing the drift similar to that of case 1, it can be shown that in each of the four cases, the Lyapunov drift is negative for λ ≤ λ max .\nBy Foster-Lyapunov theorem [11], the queue-lengths are stable for λ ≤ λ max .\nRemarks on the dynamic trafﬁc splitting algorithm: Note that the result of Theorem 2 can be generalized to the case when the data rates are {R, 0}, {r, r}, {0, R}. In this case any\nrate λ < r 2 r +δR + δR 2 2(r+δR) can be stabilized. The FCSMA based algorithm along with the dynamic trafﬁc splitting algorithm provides us with a tunable parameter δ which can be varied in order to achieve better performance. Speciﬁcally when λ 1 = λ 2 = λ, by setting δ = 0, from the result of Theorem 2 that any rate λ < α can be stabilized by the system (which is also the maximum achievable rate in the symmetric arrival case from the plot of the stability region). The parameter δ can be calculated based on the point inside the stability region in which we are operating.\nNow consider a symmetric block fading model where the channel realization is ﬁxed during the time slot but changes after every time slot t. The set of channels in the network can assume a state s = {1, . . . , S} according to stationary probability p s . We denote the cardinality of the set by |S| and |S| s =1 p s = 1. In each time slot t, the achievable rate for the three possible scheduling decisions are {{R s , 0}, {r s , r s }, {0, R s }} if the network is in fading state s at time slot t. In this scenario, when λ 1 = λ 2 = λ, the maximum rate that can be stabilized by the FCSMA policy along with trafﬁc splitting algorithm is given by\nProof: Consider the quadratic Lyapunov function given by V (Q[t]) = 2 i =1 1 2 Q 2 ii + δQ 2 i¯ i [t] . We once again ana- lyze only the following expression of the Lyapunov drift given by\nwhere B s (Q) = R s Q 11 + r s (Q 12 + Q 21 ) + R s Q 22 . Let us denote the maximum supportable arrival rate in the fading case by the notation λ max . We will ﬁrst analyze the Laypunov drift term at λ = λ max . Notice that λ max can be written as a convex combination of λ s (where λ s are some rate points inside the stability region on the line λ 1 = λ 2 ) and hence λ max = |S| s =1 p s λ s . Therefore, we can rewrite the Lyapunov drift as\nFrom the proof of Theorem 2 , we have proved that each of the terms inside the summation for is negative (every channel state) as long as\np s λ s , we have the result of (16). Also note that (17) is an increasing function of λ for a given value of queue- lengths. Hence, ˙ V (Q) λ ≤λ\nfor λ < λ max . Also, this argument holds for any value of the queue-lengths. Therefore, ˙ V (Q) ≤ 0 for λ < λ max and for all values of queue-length and hence any rate λ < λ max is stabilizable.\nIn this work, we have formulated a partially decentralized randomized scheduling algorithm for a two user set up un- der a SINR based interference model. In our algorithm, the transmitters have to exchange only one bit information be- tween themselves. Our algorithm has advantage over existing scheduling algorithms since it is decentralized in nature and can perform well under fading conditions. Our theoretical analysis was limited to the case of symmetric network settings and symmetric arrival rates. The application of the FCSMA algorithm to a general network setting is left for future investigation."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"B. Li"},{"name":"A.
