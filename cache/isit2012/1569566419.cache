Its convexity in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) plays a critical role in various optimization problems [1]. When convex, the error rate has a negative ﬁrst derivative and a positive second derivative. Additionally, if all the successive derivatives of the SER alternate in sign (referred to as complete monotonicity), then it is possible to express error rates as a positive mixture of decaying exponentials, which has applications in obtaining comparisons of average error rates over fading channels. This motivates us to explore the complete monotonicity properties of the SER of arbitrary multi-dimensional constellations, which are stronger than the corresponding convexity results in [2]. We now give an overview of the literature addressing such properties of the SER.\nOne-dimensional and two-dimensional constellations have been adopted in many communication systems in the literature, and investigations into the properties of the SER of these constellations have revealed the conditions on the convexity of the SER with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under impairing additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) [2]. Some special cases of two dimensional constellations such as M -ary phase shift keying ( M -PSK) and M -ary quadrature amplitude modulation ( M -QAM) have SERs which are known to be completely monotonic functions of the SNR [3], [4], which is a stronger condition than convexity. On the other hand, constel- lations of dimensionality greater than two (which we refer to as \u201chigher dimensional constellations\u201d henceforth) have found practical applications in satellite communications [5] and more recently, in optical communications [6]. Investigations of the\nconvexity properties of the SER of such constellations are relatively scarce in the literature, even though they could prove to be useful in system optimization. It is known that the second derivative of the SER of a constellation of dimensionality greater than two is non-negative at sufﬁciently high SNR [2]. Although this result is a general one, it does not provide a conclusive means of determining whether a given arbitrary constellation has a convex SER or not. For certain higher dimensional constellations, analytical expressions for the SER have been derived in the literature, which can be used to deduce the convexity of the SER. For example, the class of constellations of dimensionality 2, 3, 4 and 5 described in [7] can be veriﬁed to have convex SERs under AWGN. On the other hand, verifying if a SER is completely monotone is difﬁcult, even if a closed form expression for the SER is available. In addition, there has been no investigation into the complete monotonicity properties of the SER for higher dimensional constellations, which can be used to simplify the expressions for average SERs in fading channels, as well as to establish useful comparisons of average SERs of a system under two different fading channels [3], using the tools of stochastic ordering, introduced in [3], [8].\nIn this work, it is shown that the SER of an arbitrary multi-dimensional constellation impaired by additive indepen- dent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Gaussian noise under maximum likelihood detection is completely monotone in the average SNR if the constellation matrix (i.e. the matrix with column vectors as the constellation points) has a rank of one or two. This includes all constellation of dimensionality one and two, and also many constellations of higher dimensions. The result on the complete monotonicity of SER is shown generalize to the case where the noise follows a dependent compound Gaussian distribution, which includes a number of non-Gaussian models such as Cauchy, Middleton class- A and symmetric alpha-stable distributions. Since complete monotonicity implies convexity, it is seen that the SER is a convex function of the SNR regardless of the constellation dimensionality, provided that the constellation matrix has a rank of one or two. The complete monotonicity of SER can be used to compare the average SER over pairs of fading channels at all values of average SNR, even for such cases where the exact expression for the average error rate is intractable. Therefore, the contributions of this work are threefold: (i)\nthe notion of complete monotonicity of SERs is investigated; (ii) the concept of the reduced dimension of a constellation is proposed as a relevant quantity that affects convexity and complete monotonicity; (iii) stochastic ordering is proposed as an alternative application to complement existing optimization related applications of these results.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II surveys some of the relevant mathematical background. In Section III, we describe the system model considered in this paper. The main results of this work on the complete monotonicity of error rates are in Section IV. The applications of complete monotonicity of error rates in ordering the average error rates over two different fading channels is presented in Section V. For the ease of readability, the proofs have been delegated to the appendices.\nThroughout this paper, sets are denoted using calligraphic font, vectors are denoted using boldface lower-case notation, and matrices are denoted using the boldface upper-case no- tation. E [f (X)] is used to denote the expectation of the function f ( ·) over the distribution of the random variable X. P e,i (ρ) denotes the SER conditioned on the i th symbol of the constellation being transmitted, P e (ρ) denotes the SER averaged over the entire constellation, ||·|| denotes the vector- 2 norm as well as the matrix-2 norm, and I[ ·] is the indicator function, deﬁned as I[x ∈ S] = 1, if x ∈ S and 0 otherwise.\nA function f : (0, ∞) → R is completely monotone (c.m.), if it has derivatives of all orders, and satisﬁes\ndx n f (x) ≥ 0, x > 0 , \t (1) for all n ∈ N ∪ 0, where the derivative of order n = 0 in (1) is deﬁned as f (x) itself. The celebrated Bernstein\u2019s theorem [9] asserts that, f : (0, ∞) → R is c.m. if and only if it can be written in the form\nwhich is a Lebesgue integral with respect to a positive measure µ on [0, ∞). It is straightforward to verify that c.m. functions are positive and convex, and also that positive linear combi- nations of c.m. functions are also c.m.\nConsider the transmission of the N -dimensional baseband signal s through i.i.d AWGN:\nwhere the transmitted symbol s ∈ R N is chosen from a set S of M constellation points, with M ≥ N. The additive noise is i.i.d Gaussian i.e. z := [z 1 , . . . , z N ] can be written as z i ∼ N (0, 1/ρ), where ρ is the average SNR. As mentioned, ρ > 0 represents the average SNR, with the assumption that\n||s i || 2 = 1. The maximum likelihood detector is employed at the receiver, and the detected symbol is given by\nIn this case, the decision region for any symbol s i is a polyhedron [10] denoted by Ω i , given by {x|A i x ≤ b i }, i = 1 . . . , M . Further, the j th row of A i is a T j,i = (s j − s i )/ ||s j − s i || and the j th element of b i : b j,i = ||s j − s i || /2.\nIn what follows, the complete monotonicity properties of the symbol error rate of an arbitrary N dimensional constel- lation are investigated. Before proceeding, the concept of an equivalent constellation and reduced dimension is introduced, which will be used in the results.\nDeﬁnition : Let S := [s 1 . . . s M ] ∈ R N ×M denote the constellation matrix whose rank is ˜ N ≤ N, and has a singular value decomposition S = UΣV T , where U ∈ R N × ˜ N , Σ ∈ R ˜ N × ˜ N and V ∈ M × ˜ N . We deﬁne the constellation matrix ˜ S = ΣV T to be unitarily equivalent to S.\nThe SER of S and ˜ S are identical for the minimum distance receiver under AWGN, since, ˜ S = U T S, is a unitary transformation on S, which preserves the distances between constellation points, and the energy of each constellation point. Further, the noise statistics remain unchanged when multiplied by a unitary matrix.\nNow, the complete monotonicity properties of the symbol error rate P e (ρ) are discussed, which constitutes the main theorem of the paper. Throughout, the aim of this paper is not to obtain the exact performance analysis of multi-dimensional constellations. Rather, its analytical properties are the main focus.\nTheorem 1. The SER of an arbitrary multi-dimensional con- stellation impaired by AWGN is c.m. under minimum distance detection, if the constellation has a reduced dimension ˜ N ≤ 2.\nProof: See Appendix A. Appendix B has an alternate proof.\nClearly, all constellations of dimensionality one and two satisfy the conditions of Theorem 1. Thus, it is immediate that some commonly used constellations such as the square M -QAM and M -PSK have c.m. error rates, which is also corroborated by [3], [4]. As a corollary of Theorem 1, it is seen that all two dimensional constellations have convex SERs. The convexity of error rates for two dimensional constellations has been previously shown in [2]. A generalization of the proof in [2] is provided in Appendix A. An alternate proof of Theorem 1 is detailed in Appendix B, which relies on a different approach.\nIn addition to one and two dimensional constellations, Theorem 1 implies that any higher dimensional constellation will have a c.m. and convex error rate provided it has a reduced\ndimension of one or two, which is seen to occur when the constellation is unitarily equivalent to a constellation whose points lie on a plane or a line. This is an important reﬁnement to [2, Theorem 2].\nNext, it is shown that Theorem 1 generalizes to the case where the noise follows a dependent and identically distributed compound Gaussian distribution, which has been used in the wireless communications literature to model impulsive noise [11]. The noise model is the following:\nwhere g := [g 1 , . . . , g N ], with g j ∼ N (0, 1), j = 1, . . . , N and ν is a positive random variable. The compound Gaussian distribution includes a number of non-Gaussian noise models based on the distribution of ν in (5). For example, when ν is chosen as an afﬁne function of a Poisson random variable, z follows the Middleton class-A distribution [12], and when ν is chosen from a positive valued alpha-stable distribution, z follows the symmetric alpha-stable distribution [13], which includes Cauchy distributed noise as a special case.\nUnder this noise model, it is easy to verify that the SER of a constellation S and its unitarily equivalent constellation ˜ S will be identical, since the distribution of U T z will be identical to that of z. As a result, for any constellation of dimension N , we consider its unitarily equivalent constellation of dimension ˜ N . Now, in order to extend Theorem 1 to the case of dependent compound Gaussian noise, we restrict our attention to the case when ˜ N ≤ 2. Conditioning on ν in (5), the noise is AWGN, and according to Theorem 1, for any constellation, P e (ρ |ν) under minimum distance detection is c.m. if ˜ N ≤ 2. Consequently, we see that P e (ρ) = E [P e (ρ |ν)] is c.m., which can be veriﬁed by using the deﬁnition in (2). Although the above extension of Theorem 1 applies to dependent compound Gaussian noise, we note that it is possible to form a similar extension to some special cases of i.i.d compound Gaussian noise, using a minimum distance receiver. However, such a generalization is beyond the scope of this paper.\nComplete monotonicity of P e (ρ) for arbitrary constella- tions with ˜ N ≤ 2 ﬁnds direct application in comparing the average error rate of such constellations over two different fading channels. Such generic comparisons are obtained using the stochastic Laplace transform order, which is summarized below. A detailed exposition of the theory of stochastic orders can be found in [15].\nFor any two non-negative random variables X and Y , Y is said to dominate X in the Laplace transform sense (denoted by X ≤ Lt Y ) if and only if\nE [exp( −sY )] ≤ E [exp(−sX)] ∀ s ≥ 0 . \t (6) One useful property of Laplace transform ordered random variables is that for all c.m. functions g( ·), we have\nwhere z := [z 1 , z 2 ] is the AWGN with unit variance, ρ > 0 represents the average SNR, h captures the effect of quasi- static fading and s is the transmitted symbol, chosen from a constellation matrix with reduced dimension ˜ N ≤ 2.\nIn order to compare the average symbol error rate of the above system in two different fading environments, let the instantaneous channel gain in the ﬁrst scenario is given by X := |h| 2 , while that in the second being Y := |h| 2 . It has been established in [3] that if X and Y represent the instantaneous channel gains corresponding to Nakagami- m fading with two different line of sight parameters m X ≤ m Y , then X ≤ Lt Y . The same is true for Rician fading with parameters K X ≤ K Y . Interpreting g(x) in (7) as the instantaneous SER of a modulation scheme with c.m. SER, through the deﬁnition of X ≤ Lt Y , it is observed that if the average error rate of differential phase shift keying is consistently lesser in Y than in X ∀ρ, then so will be the average error rate of any constellation with ˜ N ≤ 2. In other words, for any constellation with ˜ N ≤ 2, (7) implies that E [P e (ρY )] ≤ E [P e (ρX)] ∀ρ > 0, whenever X ≤ Lt Y . This serves as a way of comparing the average error rates over two fading channels, even in cases where the expression for the average error rate is not analytically tractable.\nIn this paper, for the ﬁrst time in the literature, it is established that the symbol error rate of any arbitrary multi- dimensional constellation which is unitarily equivalent to a constellation whose points lie on a line or a plane is completely monotonic in the average SNR parameter. This result is stronger than the corresponding convexity results which have been previously established. As an application of complete monotonicity of symbol error rates, it is shown the stochastic Laplace transform order can be systematically exploited in order to obtain generic comparisons of the average symbol error rate over a pair of parametric fading channels, even in cases where the expressions for the same are intractable.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant CCF 1117041.\nIn this Appendix, we show that the proof for convexity of the SER of arbitrary constellations in [2, Appendix] can be generalized to establish its complete monotonicity.\nFor any given constellation S, we consider the its unitarily equivalent constellation ˜ S, since they have identical symbol error rates. Further, we restrict our proof to the case of ˜ N = 2, since constellations with ˜ N = 1 can be viewed as a special cases of constellations with ˜ N = 2.\nLet P z (z; ρ) := (ρ/(2π)) exp( −(ρ/2)(z 2 1 + z 2 2 )) denote the two dimensional Gaussian density function, and P c,i (ρ) := 1 − P e,i (ρ) denote the probability of correct decision con- ditioned on the s i being transmitted 1 . The k th derivative of P c,i (ρ) for k = 1, 2, . . . is given by\nThrough direct differentiation, it can be shown that the inte- grand of (9) can be written as follows:\nSince (10) depends on the value of ρ, we consider three differ- ent intervals for ρ, corresponding to high SNR, intermediate SNR and low SNR and obtain the sign of the RHS of (9) in each of these SNR regimes.\nis the square of the maximum distance from the origin to the boundary of Ω i . Now, ∀ z ∈ Ω i , g k ||z|| 2 ≤ 0, and hence, from (10), all even order derivatives of P c,i (ρ) are negative when ρ ≤ α k /d 2 max,i , while all odd order derivatives are positive in this regime.\nis the minimum distance from the origin to the boundary of Ω i . In this case, α k /ρ ≤ d 2 min,i , and ∀z ∈ {z : ||z|| 2 ≥ d 2 min,i }, g k ||z|| 2 ≥ 0. Since {z : ||z|| 2 ≥ d 2 min,i } ⊃ R 2 −Ω i (where A − B : {x ∈ A|x / ∈ B}) , we have\nwhen k is even, while the inequality in (15) is reversed when k is odd. Thus,\nwhen k is even, while the inequality in (16) is reversed when k is odd. It is easy to see that the right hand side of (16) is zero for both these cases, since the Gaussian PDF integrates to unity, whose second k th differential equals zero. Thus, all even order derivatives of P c,i (ρ) are negative when ρ ≤ α k /d 2 max,i , while all odd order derivatives are positive in this regime.\nThis SNR regime corresponds to {ρ|α k /d 2 max,i ≤ ρ ≤ α k /d 2 min,i , where d max,i and d min,i are as deﬁned in (13) and (14) respectively. Deﬁne Ω con as the region formed by the intersection of the circle {z : ||z|| 2 ≤ α k /ρ }, and the Voronoi region Ω i . Clearly, Ω con is the cone whose base is the intersection of a T j,i z = b j,i and ||z|| 2 ≤ α k /ρ. Note that Ω con partitions the Voronoi region into two sub-regions: Ω b := Ω i ∩ Ω con and Ω a := Ω i − Ω b .\nBy deﬁnition, Ω b consists of {z : ||z|| 2 ≤ α k /ρ }, which together with (11) implies g k ( ||z|| 2 ) ≤ 0. Thus, for z ∈ Ω b , (10) is negative for even k, and positive for odd k. Using this in (9), we get\nNow, ∀ {z : ||z|| 2 ≥ α k /ρ }, (10) is positive when k is even (negative, when k is odd). This region includes {z : z ∈ R 2 − Ω con ∪ Ω i }. Using this fact, we can upper-bound the integral of (10) over Ω a for even k as follows:\nwhile proceeding similarly as above, the inequality in (19) is reversed for the case of odd k. The integral in (20) can be viewed as the integral of the 2-dimensional Gaussian density over the solid angle θ spanned by Ω con , which is given by 1 − θ/2π. Using this fact with (19), we get\nwhen k is even, and a reverse in the inequality in (21), when k is odd. Adding (17) and (21), we see that in the intermediate SNR regime, (9) is negative, when k is even, and vice-versa, when k is odd.\nCombining the results from Cases (i), (ii) and (iii), we conclude that the derivatives of P c,i (ρ) alternate in sign, with the ﬁrst derivative being positive. Consequently, P e,i (ρ) is a c.m. function. This implies P e (ρ) := i Pr[s = s i ]P e,i (ρ) is also a c.m. function, since c.m. functions are closed under conic combinations.\nAs in Appendix A, we consider the unitarily equivalent constellation ˜ S, instead of S,and restrict our proof to the case of ˜ N = 2, since constellations with ˜ N = 1 are special cases of constellations with ˜ N = 2.\nSince z is AWGN, the decision region for the symbol s i is a polygon, denoted by Ω i , and the corresponding SER is given by\nwhere the origin of the coordinate system has been shifted to s i . Let F i denote the total number of edges of Ω i . Then, following the procedure outlined in [16], the R 2 space can be partitioned into a number of disjoint conical regions Ω con,f,i , each of which is formed by joining the origin and the vertices of Ω i . Thus, the error region for s i is given by\nξ f,i , where ξ f,i := Ω con − Ω i [16], so that\nNow, applying the transformation z 1 = σr cos φ and z 2 = σr sin φ, on (23), we get\nwhere φ f is the angle between the lines joining the origin and the vertices on the f th edge of the decision region, and R f,i (φ) equals the distance of point (r, φ) on the edge a T f,i z = b f,i from the origin, and is given by\nwhere b f,i is the f th element of b i , and ψ f,i := a 1,f,i / a 2 1,f,i + a 2 2,f,i , where a j,f,i := [A i ] j,f , j = 1, 2.\nNow, using (25) in (24) and carrying out the integration with respect to r, we get\nThrough a change of variables, u = 1/2 sin 2 (φ + ψ f,i ), (26) can be expressed in the form\n \n(28) Clearly µ f,i (u) ≥ 0 ∀u ∈ [0, ∞). Thus, through Bernstein\u2019s Theorem P e,i (ρ) is a c.m. function of ρ. Finally, P e (ρ) =\nP e,i (ρ) Pr[s = s i ] is a positive linear combination of P e,i (ρ), which is also c.m., since c.m. functions are closed under positive linear combinations."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"Y.
