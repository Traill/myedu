Relay operation modes can be classiﬁed into full-duplex in which the relays can transmit and receive information on the same physical channel, and half-duplex in which the relays transmit and receive information on orthogonal channels. To ensure effective col- laboration between the transmitter and the relay, both the transmission scheme and the relaying mechanism have to be designed jointly for the given channel conditions [2]. For instance, when the transmitted signal, the signal observed by the relay and the signal observed by the receiver form a Markov chain, the relay channel is said to be physically degraded, and the optimal full-duplex relaying strategy is the decode-and-forward (DF) scheme [3]. On the other hand, when the signal received by the relay is a physically degraded version of the direct component of the signal observed by the receiver, the channel is said to be reversely degraded and the optimal strategy is for the relay to remain silent [3].\nThe capacity of a broad class of half-duplex relay channels was obtained in [4]. In contrast, the capacity of general full- duplex relay channels that are neither degraded nor reversely degraded, remains an open problem, and relaying techniques other than DF are able to achieve higher data rates [5]. For instance, under certain channel conditions, the compress- and-forward (CF) relaying scheme developed in [3] and the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme considered in [5] attain higher rates than DF. In comparison with DF and CF, AF re- laying is less computationally demanding and is hence suitable for relaying terminals with low processing capabilities.\nMotivated by the potential gains and computational efﬁ- ciency of AF relaying, in this paper we consider the joint design of the input transmit covariance and the relay precoder of an AF relay-assisted communication system with a direct link between the source and the destination. Similar to [5], we assume that the relay operates in a full-duplex mode. As mentioned in [5], this joint optimization for a block size greater than two is a \u201cdaunting\u201d task. Indeed, it is a non-convex problem with potentially high dimensionality. To address this difﬁculty, we propose a technique for performing the joint optimization of the input transmit covariance and the relay precoder. First, we note that when the relay precoder matrix is given, the design problem of the input covariance can be cast in a convex form for which the Karush-Kuhn- Tucker (KKT) conditions are necessary and sufﬁcient for optimality. By analyzing these conditions, we obtain closed form expressions of the optimal input covariance correspond- ing to an arbitrary relay precoder. Using these expressions, it is shown that the maximum rate of the AF scheme is achieved by subdiagonal precoders. This observation reduces the number of optimization variables from being quadratic to linear in the block length. In addition, it enables us to identify precoders that satisfy necessary optimality conditions at low and high transmit powers. These precoders possess an interlacing structure, which implies that the relay transmits during every other symbol interval, as in half-duplex operation. Optimal precoders with this structure are obtained using an efﬁcient algorithm that requires searching over two variables.\nWe consider the full-duplex AF relaying scheme for the scalar quasi-static frequency-ﬂat Gaussian relay channel con- sidered in [5] and shown in Figure 1. In this scheme, the signal vector transmitted by the source is denoted by X ∈ R k×1 and that received by the relay is denoted by Y 1 ∈ R k×1 . The relay processes Y 1 and generates a signal X 1 ∈ R k×1 . To allow for symbol synchronization and signal processing, the relay transmissions depends on the signal received in the previous symbol intervals, but not the current one [5]. Hence, the ﬁrst entry of X 1 is zero. The signal vector received at the destination is denoted by Y ∈ R k×1 . The channel gain between the source and the destination is normalized to unity, that between the source and the relay is denoted by a, and that between the relay and the destination is denoted by b. Hence, the received signal of the relay can be expressed as\nY 1 = aX +Z 1 , where Z 1 ∼N (0, NI) is the additive Gaussian noise at the relay, N is the noise variance and I is the k × k identity matrix. The relay performs linear processing on Y 1 , which is equivalent to left multiplying Y 1 by a strictly lower triangular precoder matrix D. The relay output is X 1 = DY 1 , and thus the received signal at the destination is\nwhere Z ∼ N (0, NI) is the additive white Gaussian noise at the destination; Z 1 and Z are statistically independent. The source and relay transmit power budgets for a block of k channel uses are denoted by c 1 and c 2 , respectively.\nFrom (1), it can be readily seen that the maximum rate for this channel is achieved when the distribution of X is Gaussian [6]; i.e., X ∼ N (0, Σ), where Σ = E{XX T } ∈ R k×k is the input covariance matrix. In this case, the jointly rate-optimal Σ and relay precoder D can be expressed as the solution of the following optimization problem:\nsubject to Σ 0, \t Tr(Σ) ≤ c 1 , \t (2a) Tr(a 2 DΣD T + N DD T ) ≤ c 2 , \t (2b)\nD ij = 0, j ≥ i, \t (2c) where the second constraint in (2a) and the constraint in (2b) ensure that the average powers transmitted from the source and that transmitted by the relay during a block of k channel uses do not exceed prescribed values c 1 and c 2 , respectively.\nThe optimization problem in (2) is non-convex in Σ and D and hence is difﬁcult to solve. To tackle this problem, we begin by assuming that a strictly lower triangular relay precoder D is given. We then seek closed form expressions for the optimal covariance matrix, Σ. We will later use these expressions to guide the optimization of the precoder matrix, D.\nWith D ﬁxed, the problem in (2) is convex, and with c 1 and c 2 strictly positive, it is strictly feasible. Hence, Slater\u2019s con- dition holds and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are necessary and sufﬁcient for optimality [7]. Using results from [8] and [9], the KKT conditions can be written as:\nΣ 0, Tr(Σ) ≤ c 1 , Tr(DΣD T ) ≤ c \u2032 2 , \t (3b) Φ 0, µ 1 ≥ 0, µ 2 ≥ 0, \t (3c)\nTr(ΦΣ) = 0, µ 1 Tr(Σ) − c 1 = 0, \t (3d) µ 2 Tr(DΣD T ) − c \u2032 2 = 0. \t (3e)\nwhere H \t 1 √ N (I + b 2 DD T ) −1/2 (I + abD), c \u2032 2 1 a 2 c 2 − N Tr(DD T ) , Φ is the dual variable matrix corresponding to the ﬁrst constraint in (2a), and µ 1 and µ 2 are the dual variables corresponding to the second constraint in (2a) and the constraint in (2b), respectively.\nFrom the deﬁnition of the matrix H, it can be seen that H T H ≻ 0. Hence, from (3a), we have\nThe matrix (µ 1 I + µ 2 D T D − Φ) = Σ + (H T H) −1 −1 is positive deﬁnite (cf. (4)) and Φ 0. Hence, we have µ 1 I + µ 2 D T D ≻ 0 but since D T D is rank deﬁcient because D is strictly lower triangular, it follows that µ 1 > 0, which, together with the second equality in (3d), yields Tr(Σ) = c 1 .\nSince both Φ and Σ are positive semideﬁnite, it follows that either Φ = 0 or the columns of Φ span the null-space spanned by the columns of Σ = (µ 1 I + µ 2 D T D − Φ) −1 − (H T H) −1 ; that is, the condition in (6) is equivalent to\nWe now consider µ 1 , µ 2 and Φ that solve (3). Note from (5) that choosing µ 1 , µ 2 and Φ such that (µ 1 I + µ 2 D T D − Φ) = H T H yields Σ = 0, which contradicts the condition that Tr(Σ) = c 1 . Three distinct cases can be considered; viz, Case I: µ 2 ≥ 0, Φ = 0, Case II-A: µ 2 = 0, Φ = 0, and Case II-B: µ 2 > 0, Φ = 0. The last case is more general and more involved than the ﬁrst two. Hence, we will focus herein on this case. The other cases are considered in [10].\nUsing (7), the equality in (5) is cast in forms that are more convenient to derive expressions for Σ and Φ. In particular, multiplying both sides of (5) by (µ 1 I + µ 2 D T D − Φ) yields\n(10) Let ν 1 = 1/µ 1 , ν 2 = µ 2 /µ 1 , k Σ = rank(Σ) and deﬁne\nFrom (8), the vectors of Φ must span the null space of the matrix (µ 1 I + µ 2 D T D − Φ) −1 − (H T H) −1 ; that is, if U Φ Λ Φ U T Φ and U Σ Λ Σ U T Σ denote the eigendecompositions of Φ and Σ, respectively, then U Σ = U ⊥ Φ , where U ⊥ Φ denotes the or- thonormal matrix that spans the null space of Φ. Hence, the full eigendecomposition of Σ can be denoted by U Λ Σ 0 0 0 U T , where U = U Σ U Φ . The equality in (10) can be written as\nΛ Σ 0 0 0\n0 0 = 0, (12)\nWe now derive similar equations for the dual matrix, Φ. Right multiplying (9) by Φ and using (7) yields\nU T to denote the full eigendecomposition of Φ and manipulating (14) yields\nFrom (13) and (15) it is seen that A 11 , C 22 , Λ Σ and Λ Φ are full rank and positive deﬁnite. Since, for any two square matrices W 1 and W 2 , the eigenvalues of W 1 W 2 are the same as the eigenvalues of W 2 W 1 , it follows that k Σ and k Φ = k − k Σ must be such that the k Σ eigenvalues of B 11 are less than ν 1 and the k Φ eigenvalues of B 22 are greater than ν 1 .\nWe now proceed to determine the orthogonal bases of Σ and Φ. From (13) and (15) it is seen that B 21 = U T Φ ˜ BU Φ = 0. To determine U Φ and U Σ , we invoke the Schur decomposition of an arbitrary asymmetric matrix W .\nW ∈ R n×n be an asymmetric matrix with real eigenvalues. For each such matrix there exists an orthonormal matrix Ψ such that the matrix ΨW Ψ T is upper triangular. The diagonal entries of ΨW Ψ T are the eigenvalues of W and their order can be arbitrarily chosen depending on Ψ.\nWe now apply Lemma 1 to the matrix ˜ B. Let ˜ U be the Schur basis of ˜ B that arranges its eigenvalues in a non-decreasing order, i.e., ˜ U T ˜ B ˜ U is upper triangular with non-decreasing diagonal entries. From (13) and (15) we have that B 21 = 0. However, these equations do not require B 11 and B 22 to be upper triangular. Hence, it can be seen that to satisfy these equations, we can choose U = U Σ U Φ to be in the form\nwhere Q 1 ∈ R k Σ ×k Σ and Q 2 ∈ R k Φ ×k Φ are orthonormal and ˜ U 1 ∈ R k×k Σ and ˜ U 2 ∈ R k×k Φ are complementary partitions of ˜ U . Using (16) in the ﬁrst equality in (15) yields\n(18) Since the matrix Φ is symmetric, the matrix ( ˜ U T 2 ˜ C ˜ U 2 ) −1 ( ˜ U T 2 ˜ B ˜ U 2 ) must be symmetric, which is what we show next using the following lemma.\nLemma 2: Let W 1 , W 2 ∈ R n×n be two nonsingular sym- metric matrices. Let Ψ = Ψ 1 Ψ 2 be a Schur orthonormal basis of the matrix W 1 W 2 , where Ψ 1 and Ψ 2 are arbitrary complementary partitions of this basis. Then\nLetting W 1 = ˜ C and W 2 = ˜ A implies that W 1 W 2 = ˜ B, which using Lemma 2 implies that Φ in (18) is symmetric.\n(19) Using (19) in Tr(Σ) = c 1 and Tr(D T DΣ) = c \u2032 2 yields\nSince ˜ U T 1 D T D ˜ U 1 is positive semideﬁnite, Lemma 1 in [10] asserts that the left hand side of (20) is monotonically decreas- ing in ν 2 . This observation is used in the following algorithm to facilitate the search for the optimal ν 2 and Σ.\n\u2022 Let δ be a small step size. Start from ν 2 = 0 and k Σ = 1. \u2022 Compute ˜ U (0) = ˜ U (0) 1 \t ˜ U (0) 2 \t ∈ R k×k to be the Schur\nbasis that orders the eigenvalues of ˜ B in (11) in a non- decreasing order, where ˜ U (0) 1 ∈ R k×k Σ , ˜ U (0) 2 ∈ R k×k Φ .\n\u2013 If ˜ U (0) 1 − ˜ U (1) 1 > ǫ, k Σ ← k Σ + 1 and repeat, else proceed to the next step.\n\u2013 If the value of ν 1 lies between the k Σ -th and k Σ + 1- th diagonal entries of ˜ B, determine Σ using (19). Otherwise, k Σ ← k Σ + 1, and repeat.\n\u2022 If no k Σ < k can be found, ν 2 ← ν 2 + δ, and repeat. 2 Note that this algorithm simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly in the cases of ν 2 = 0 and Φ = 0; cf. [10] for details.\nIn the next section, we will use the expression obtained for the optimal Σ to gain insight into the optimal relay precoders.\nIn Section III, it was shown that the optimal Σ is parametrized by D, ν 1 and ν 2 . Hence, ﬁnding a jointly optimal input covariance-relay precoder pair can be cast as an optimization problem in these variables. The cases in which ν 2 = 0 and Φ = 0 can be inferred from the case in which ν 2 > 0 and Φ = 0. Hence, we will focus on the latter case.\nWhen ν 2 > 0 and Φ = 0, the optimal Σ is given by the expression in (19). We recall that in that expression ˜ U 1 ∈ R k×k Σ is the matrix containing the Schur vectors corre- sponding to the smallest k Σ eigenvalues of the (asymmetric) matrix ˜ B = (H T H) −1 I + ν 2 D T D . Using (19), the relay precoder optimization problem can be expressed as\n(21b) ν 1 Tr (I + ν 2 ˜ U T 1 D T D ˜ U 1 ) −1\n− Tr ( ˜ U T 1 H T H ˜ U 1 ) −1 ≤ c 1 , (21c) Tr a 2 ˜ U T 1 D T D ˜ U 1 ν 1 (I + ν 2 ˜ U T 1 D T D ˜ U 1 ) −1\nThe problem in (21) is non-convex. However, in the next section we will show how this optimization problem can be simpliﬁed without loss of optimality. We will then use this simpliﬁcation to obtain input covariance-relay precoder pairs that become asymptotically optimal at low and high SNRs.\nThe algorithm developed in Section III for optimizing Σ for any given precoder D ∈ R k×k required the search over the dual variable ν 2 . Using these algorithms, the jointly optimal (Σ, D) pair can be determined by searching over the k(k − 1)/2 degrees of freedom in D, in addition to ν 2 . The main result of this section is given in the following proposition:\nProposition 1: For the problem in (21) to yield the maxi- mum rate, it sufﬁces to restrict D to be subdiagonal, i.e.,\n     \n0 \t 0 · · · \t 0 \t 0 ±σ 1 0 · · · 0 0\n0 ±σ 2 · · · \t 0 \t 0 .. . .. . . .. .. . .. . 0 \t 0 · · · ±σ k−1 0\n     \nwhere {σ i } k−1 i=1 are the singular values of D. Proof: See Appendix C in [10].\nFrom this proposition, and noting that the dual variable ν 1 can be readily eliminated from (21), it can be seen that the optimal (Σ, D) pair can be determined by searching over ν 2 and the k − 1 degrees of freedom of precoders of the form in (22). In other words, using Proposition 1, ﬁnding the jointly optimal (Σ, D) pair reduces the search from k(k − 1)/2 + 1 variables to k variables. Despite the reduction in the search space, solving (21) for large k can be quite difﬁcult. To circumvent this difﬁculty, in the next section we will show how restricting D to be subdiagonal will enable us to obtain solutions of the optimization problem in (21) that are asymptotically optimal at low and high SNRs. The key to the asymptotic analysis is to invoke Lemma 2 in the optimization problem in (21) to show that this problem is equivalent to a problem with the following objective:\nTo draw insight from the resulting formulation, we invoke Proposition 1 to restrict attention to precoders of the sub- diagonal form in (22). These precoder yield ˜ B −1 = I + ν 2 D T D −1 (H T H) with the following tridiagonal form:\n       \n       \n, i = 1, . . . , k, and σ 0 = σ k = 0.\nEvaluating the constraints and the objective of the formula- tion equivalent to (21) requires analytical expressions for the eigenvalues of ˜ B −1 . Unfortunately, such expressions are not known and only bounds and results pertaining to special forms are available; see e.g., [12]. A classical result related to these eigenvalues is stated in the following lemma [13, p. 312].\nLemma 3: If an eigenvalue of a matrix in the form in (25) has multiplicity r, then at least r −1 of the subdiagonal entries are zero, i.e., ζ i 1 = ζ i 2 = · · · = ζ i r\n= 0 for i j ∈ {1, · · · , k− 1 }, j = 1, . . . , r − 1. \t 2 In the next section, this result will be used to identify a class of relay precoders that satisfy necessary optimality conditions at low and high transmit powers.\nWe consider the case of c 1 → 0. The case of c 1 → ∞ follows similarly.\nWhen c 1 → 0, ν 2 → 0 the constraint in (21d) becomes redundant and can be dropped without loss of optimality. Next, we assume that ν 1 is given. Using Lemma 3, it can be shown that the KKT conditions corresponding to the resulting problem are satisﬁed only when the matrix D possesses an interlacing subdiagonal structure; that is {σ i } k−1 i=1 in (22) has the following structure: σ 2i = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k 2 − 1, and let σ 2i−1 = 0 for i = 1, . . . , r, and σ 2i−1 = σ D > 0 for i = r + 1, . . . , k 2 , for some r ∈ {0, . . . , k 2 − 1}.\nWe make two remarks regarding the interlacing subdiagonal structure of D. First, in this case the joint optimization of D and Σ reduces to a search over two variables ν 1 and σ D for any k. Second, the interlacing structure implies that the relay transmits during every other symbol interval, which resembles operating in a half-duplex mode. The asymptotic optimality of such precoders are illustrated in the next section.\nIn this section, we provide a numerical example when the block length, k = 4, the noise variance, N = 1, the source- relay channel gain, a = 1.25, and the relay-destination channel gain, b = 0.7. The relay power budget c 2 = 10 dB and the transmitter power is varied between 0 and 20 dB.\nIn Figure 2, we plot the rates yielded the optimal input covariance-relay precoder pair. This pair was obtained by exhaustive search over subdiagonal precoders of the form in (22) and applying Algorithm 1 to obtain the corresponding optimal covariance matrix. In Figure 2, we plot the rates corresponding to the asymptotically optimal relay precoders obtained using an efﬁcient algorithm for optimizing Σ and subdiagonal D with interlacing structure. For comparison, in this ﬁgure we also plot the rates yielded by scaled identity input covariance and the optimal covariance corresponding to a subdiagonal precoder matrix with D i+1,i = 1/\nThis ﬁgure shows that when the transmit power, c 1 , is low (less than 6 dB) or high (greater than 16 dB), the rate achieved\nby the asymptotically optimal relay matrices coincides with that achieved by the optimal relay matrices. For intermediate powers, the gap between the rates achieved by the optimal and the asymptotically optimal precoders appears to be small.\nThe capacity of the amplify-and-forward scheme in full- duplex Gaussian relay channels is cast as the solution of a joint optimization problem of the input covariance and the relay precoder. The joint problem is not convex, but the problem of ﬁnding the optimal input covariance for a given relay precoder is convex. This observation enables us to use the KKT conditions to obtain closed form expressions for the optimal input covariance as a function of the given relay precoder. Using these expressions, it was shown that restricting the relay precoders to be subdiagonal, thereby reducing the number of optimization variables from quadratic to linear in the block length, does not incur loss of optimality. The subdiagonal structure enables us to identify a class of relay precoders that are asymptotically optimal at low and high transmit powers. Precoders in this class transmit during every other symbol interval, as in half duplex operation.\nThe authors would like to thank C. (Sekhar) Bontu, C. Royer and J.
