For any channel code of length n and tolerable decoding error probability , the maximum volume of the code is given by M ∗ (n, ) = e nC+o(n) . The o(n) is signiﬁcant for practical values of n, hence much effort went into characterizing it in the early 1960\u2019s. In particular, Strassen [1] discovered that, under regularity assumptions, the o(n) term is of the form −\nnV Φ −1 (1 − ) + O(log n) where Φ is the Gaussian cumulative distribution function (cdf) and V is the channel dispersion, or second-order coding rate. This line of research seemed forgotten until new ideas revived it, almost half a century later [2], [3], [4]. The sharpest general result to date is\nThe appeal of asymptotic expansions such as (1) is that (i) they convey signiﬁcant insights into the essence of the problem and (ii) they are practically useful as the remainder O(·) term can be bounded and often neglected for moderate values of n, as demonstrated in [2].\nStill there remains much mystery regarding the third term in (1), which has been characterized only for the binary symmetric channel (BSC) where it is 1 2 log n [2, p. 2332]. For the additive white Gaussian channel, the third term is sandwiched between O(1) and 3 2 log n + O(1). For the binary erasure channel (BEC), the third term is O(1). For discrete memoryless channels with ﬁnite input alphabet X , under regularity assumptions on the channel law, the third term can be upper-bounded by 1 2 (|X | − 1) log n. The third term is often signiﬁcant for moderate values of n. Additional analysis is given in [3, Sec. 3.4.5].\nOur recent paper [5] presents a more reﬁned analysis of the problem, in which asymptotic equalities for the relevant\nerror probabilities are obtained using strong large-deviations analysis, which are closely related to Laplace\u2019s method for asymptotic expansion of integrals [6], [7], [8]. A strong large- deviations analysis provides an asymptotic expansion for the probability of rare events such as n i=1 U i ≥ na where {U i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n} are independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables, and a is strictly larger than the mean of U 1 [6], [7]. In contrast, the classical (\u201cweak\u201d) large-deviations analysis merely states that the aforementioned probability vanishes as exp{−nΛ(a)+o(n)} where Λ(·) denotes the large- deviations function for U 1 .\nThis paper builds on [5] to analyze the performance of constant-composition codes , which are well suited to coding problems involving input constraints, in which case iid random codes generally fail to achieve the second-order rate. In the absence of input constraints, we also show that the log-volume achieved by random constant-composition codes differs from that achieved by iid random codes by a constant ∆ cc that is explicitly identiﬁed.\nTo carry this analysis, we have derived a new result on conditional strong large-deviations analysis. This shows that the O(log n) term in (1) is 1 2 log n under regularity assump- tions. The analysis also yields the next term in the expansion, which is a constant when the underlying loglikelihood random variables are of the nonlattice type, and a bounded oscillating function of n otherwise. The quest for that term requires a precise characterization of the asymptotics of channel ﬂuctua- tions. To this end we use two-term Edgeworth expansions [9], [10] which can be traced back to Cram´er [11] and Esseen [12]. The Berry-Esseen theorem [10] was used in [1], [2] provides a bound for deviation from Gaussianity, but that bound is not sharp enough for our purposes.\nAll the analysis and results in this paper are based on asymptotics and the average error probability criterion. Only two inequalities are used. The ﬁrst is the classical union- of-events bound (also see the RCU bound of [2, p. 2312]), which is used for analysis of our random-coding scheme and turns out to be remarkably tight. The second inequality is one introduced in [2] for proving converse theorems: it provides an upper bound for M ∗ (n, ) in terms of a maxmin optimization problem involving the power of a Neyman-Pearson test at signiﬁcance level 1 − . This is a remarkably powerful idea which can also be traced back to Strassen [1, pp. 711, 712].\nIn order to keep the presentation focused, we assume broad regularity conditions on the channels of interest and exclude\namong others channels with zero dispersion and channels for which the capacity-achieving distribution is not unique. Due to space limitations, only sketches of the proofs are given here; complete derivations are given in the full paper [13].\nNotation. We use uppercase letters for random variables, lowercase letters for their individual values, calligraphic letters for alphabets, and boldface letters for sequences. The set of all probability measures over a ﬁnite set X is denoted by P(X ). Mathematical expectation with respect to probabil- ity distribution P is denoted by the symbol E P . Given a distribution P on the random variable X and a conditional distribution W on another random variable Y given X, we denote by P × W the joint distribution on (X, Y ) and by (P W ) the marginal distribution on Y . The indicator function of a set A is denoted by 1{x ∈ A}. All logarithms are natural logarithms. The probability density function (pdf) of the normal random variable is denoted by φ(x), x ∈ R and its cdf by Φ(x) = x −∞ φ.\nThe symbol f (n) ∼ g(n) denotes asymptotic equality: lim n→∞ f (n) g(n) = 1. The notations f (n) = o(g(n)) (small oh) and f (n) = O(g(n)) (big oh) indicate that lim n→∞ f (n) g(n) is zero and ﬁnite, respectively.\nLet X and Y be two ﬁnite alphabets. Consider a memoryless channel (W, X , Y) characterized by a conditional probability mass function {W (y|x), x ∈ X , y ∈ Y}. Given an input probability distribution P on X , denote by (P W )(y) =\nP (x)W (y|x), ∀y ∈ Y the output probability distri- bution. Given X = x, the conditional pdf above will often be denoted by W x ∈ P(Y). Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions P and Q on a common alphabet is denoted by D(P Q) E P [ln P (X) Q(X) ], divergence variance by V (P Q) \t E P [ln P (X) Q(X) ] 2 − D 2 (P Q), and divergence third moment by T (P Q) \t E P [ln P (X) Q(X) − D(P Q)] 3 . Given two alphabets X and Y, a X -valued random variable X distributed as P , and two conditional distributions W and Q on a Y-valued random variable Y given X, we denote by D(W Q|P ) = E P ×W ln W (Y |X) Q(Y |X) the conditional KL divergence between W and Q given P , and likewise by V (W Q|P ) and T (W Q|P ) the conditional divergence variance and the conditional divergence third moment.\nA real random variable L is said to be of the lattice type if there exists numbers d and l 0 such that L belongs to the lattice {l 0 + kd, k ∈ Z} with probability 1. The largest d for which this holds is called the span of the lattice, and l 0 is the offset .\nThe empirical distribution (n-type) on X of a sequence x ∈ X n is deﬁned by ˆ P x (x) 1 n n i=1 1{x i = x}, x ∈ X . We denote by T [P ] the set of all sequences of type P (type class) and by U X|P the uniform distribution over type class T [P ].\nFollowing Gallager [14, p. 17], deﬁne the mutual informa- tion between the events X = x and Y = y as\nFor some DMCs with capacity-achieving distribution, the random variable l(X, Y ) is of the lattice type. For instance l(X; Y ) ∈ {log(2λ), log(2 − 2λ)} for the BSC with crossover probability λ = {0, 1 2 , 1} and uniform input distribution; the span of the lattice is log | λ 1−λ |. However for almost every asymmetric binary channel, as well as for almost every nonbinary channel (symmetric or not), l(X; Y ) is not of the lattice type. We refer to capacity problems where l(X, Y ) is of the lattice type as the lattice case. The lattice case is not considered in this paper.\nLet W x {W (·|x)} ∈ P(Y) for each x ∈ X . We deﬁne the following moments of the random variable l(X, Y ) with respect to the joint distribution P ×W : the unconditional mean (= mutual information)\nWe also deﬁne the Fisher information matrix J whose components are\nThe rank of this matrix is at most |X | − 1; denote by J \u2020 its pseudo-inverse. We shall also use the nonnegative quantity\n(9) which is actually zero in several problems of interest. We also denote by V (P, W ) ∈ R |X | the gradient of V (P, W ) with respect to P .\nNext, let the triple (X , X, Y ) ∈ X 2 × Y be distributed according to the joint probability law P X XY (x , x, y) = P (x )P (x)W (y|x). Deﬁne the tilted joint distribution\nwhich has the same X and (X, Y ) marginals as P X XY but is symmetric in X and X. The random variables A\nbut have the same marginal owing to the symmetry property above. Denote by\nthe normalized correlation coefﬁcient between A and B under ˜ P X XY . For an additive-noise channel, ρ(P ∗ , W ) = 0 for the\n(uniform) capacity-achieving distribution P ∗ [5]. Finally, deﬁne the matrices (y, y ∈ Y)\nwhere \u2020 denotes matrix pseudo-inverse. Both K G and K H have rows summing to zero and are thus rank-deﬁcient, where the constant eigenvector [|Y| −1/2 , · · · , |Y| −1/2 ] corresponds to the null eigenvalue. The notation |K| denotes the product of the nonzero eigenvalues of the matrix K.\nThe message m to be transmitted is drawn uniformly from the message set M n = {1, 2, · · · , M n }. A code is a pair of encoder mapping f n : M n → F ⊂ X n , x(m) = f n (m), and decoder mapping g n : Y n → M n , ˆ m = g n (y). The code has volume (or size) M n and rate R n = 1 n log M n .\nWe assume that codewords are subject to a cost constraint. Given a cost function ψ : X → R and a target cost ξ, we assume the maximum-cost constraint\n1 n\nSince this paper only deals with constant-composition codes, the same results can be obtained under an average-cost con- straint.

Then\nThe lower bound is achieved by random constant-composition codes with type\n(22) Here P ∗ n achieves the maximum of the functional nI(P ; W )−\nA sketch of the derivation of the lower and upper bounds is presented in Secs. III and IV, respectively. It is unclear whether the gap 1−log(1−ρ 2 ) between lower and upper bounds should be attributed to the use of random codes, or to the union bound, or both. Either way, the gap can easily be computed explicitly via (11) and may be as small as one nat (for for additive noise channels). Hence random codes perform well, and the union bound is quite tight. Also note that [2, Theorem 48] used a different method to derive an upper bound on log M ∗ cc (n, ). However that method does not yield an explicit value for the O(1) term.\nThis section presents three results that are used to prove the direct coding theorem and the converse. The ﬁrst is a reﬁnement on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The second is a new strong large-deviations result for Neyman-Pearson tests. The third is a new conditional strong large-deviations result.\nFix a type P and let X be uniformly distributed over T [P ] (X ∼ U X|P ). Let Q n \t (U X|P W n ) ∈ P(Y n ). We derive\nThe mean and variance of Z n are respectively given by I(U X|P , W n ) and V (U X|P , W n ), asymptotic expansions of which are given in the following lemma.\nSince both Q n and (P W ) n are permutation-invariant, the divergence D(Q n (P W ) n ) equals the divergence between the distribution of the corresponding random types ˆ Q \t ˆ P Y (where Y ∼ Q n ) and ˆ P ˆ P Y (where Y ∼ (P W ) n ) on Y. Deﬁne the normalized random variables\nThus D(Q n (P W ) n ) = D(P G n P H n ). The random variables G n and H n have zero means and respective covariance ma- trices K G and K H of (12), (13), for all n. They converge in distribution to N (0, K G ) and N (0, K H ), respectively. Let G ∗ and H ∗ be Gaussian random vectors with the same mean and covariance matrix as G n and H n , respectively. The divergence D(Q n (P W ) n ) = D(P G n P H n ) converges to\n(25) Combining (24) and (25) proves the ﬁrst part of the claim\n(about the mean of Z n ).

Then\nStrong Large Deviations for Binary Hypothesis testing. We use the following lemma from [5]:\nLemma 2.3: (Second-order Taylor series expansion of large-deviations function for binary hypothesis testing .) Con- sider two probability measures P and Q over a common space and assume that P is dominated by Q (P \t Q). Assume D = D(P Q) and V = V (P Q) are positive and ﬁnite, and T = T (P Q) is ﬁnite. Let Λ(a) = sup s [as − κ(s)] where the cumulant generating funtion κ(s) = ln E Q [( dP dQ ) s ]. Then\nThe following result is a variation of the large-deviations analysis of [5] for the sum of iid random variables, and uses Lemma 2.3. The ﬁnal equality follows by application of Lemma 2.1.\nProposition 2.4: Let t and B ∈ R be arbitrary constants. Fix a n-type P and let Q n (U X|P W n ). Assume Z n of (23) is of the nonlattice type.

The codewords {x(m), 1 ≤ m ≤ M n } are drawn iid from the type class T [P ∗ n ] where P ∗ n is given in (22) and the O(1/n) term is selected to ensure P ∗ n is a valid type, i.e., each P ∗ n (x), x ∈ X , is a multiple of 1/n. Deﬁne the random variables\nHence Z m,n is a loglikelihood score minus the constant ln Q n (Y). The ML decoding rule can be written as\nOverview of error probability analysis. By symmetry of the codebook construction and the decoding rule, the error probability for message m is independent of m. For the calculation below, we assume without loss of generality that m = 1 was sent. We use the bound\nwhere the inequality follows from the union bound. In the last line, z ∗ n is derived so that (M n −1)Pr[Z 2,n ≥ z ∗ n |Z 1,n = z ∗ n ] = 1. We then use precise asymptotics for P Z 1,n and P Z 2,n |Z 1,n to derive the desired result. It sufﬁces to prove achievability of an average probability of + o(n −1/2 ) to prove the claim.\nThe statistics of Z 1,n are obtained from Lemma 2.1 with P ∗ n in place of P . Deﬁning T n = (Z 1,n − E[Z 1,n ])/ Var(Z 1,n ) and using Prop. 2.2, we obtain F T n (t ,n ) = 1 − + o(n −1/2 ). The conditional probability P Z 2,n |Z 1,n [Z 2,n ≥ z|Z 1,n = z] in (36) is evaluated using Prop. 2.6. The threshold z ∗ n is selected as z ∗ n = E[Z 1,n ]− Var[Z 1,n ]t ∗ n where t ∗ n = t ,n + 1 √ nV . Then the two terms in the right side of (36) are respectively given by − φ(t ) √ nV + o(n −1/2 ) and φ(t ) √ nV (1 + o(1)). The O(n −1/2 ) terms cancel out and the desired result follows.\nTo prove the upper bound in Theorem 1.1, we apply Theorem 28 for constant-composition codes in [2, p. 2318] which implies M (n, ) ≤ 1/β 1− (W n (·|x), Q Y ) where Q Y is an arbitrary permutation-invariant distribution on Y n , and x is any element of T [P ] where P ∈ Γ(ξ). Using the same arguments as in [2, Lemma 29] and choosing Q Y = Q n , we have\nThe asymptotics of the right side are given in Prop. 2.5. Optimizing over all feasible P proves the claim.\nThis work was supported by DARPA under the ITMANET program. The author would like to thank T.
