In essence, DoF characterization provides the capacity of wireless networks within o(log(SNR)). The key issue is how to efﬁciently manage inter-user interference in oder to achieve the optimal DoF and there has been remarkable progress in recent years.\n\u2022 Interference Networks: For interference networks or in- terference channels, it appears that interference alignment is essentially required in order to achieve the optimal DoF for more than two users. Interference alignment for the K-user interference channel has been originally pro- posed by Cadambe and Jafar with signal space alignment [1] showing that each source\u2013destination (SD) pair can achieve 1/2 DoF regardless of the number of SD pairs. Other types of alignment have been proposed based on the number theory [2] and ergodic setting [3].\n\u2022 Partially Connected Interference Networks: Obvi- ously, network connectivities can affect the DoF and one of the important classes of partially connected networks are layered networks. For multi-hop networks, inter-user interference can be cancelled through multiple paths, which is referred to as interference neutralization. For 2- user 2-hop networks, aligned interference neutralization in [4] can achieve the optimal 2 DoF. Ergodic interference\nneutralization has been proposed in [5] for K-user K-hop networks showing that the optimal K DoF is achievable for isotropic fading. More recently, the result in [4] has been generalized to 2-user multi-hop networks [6], [7].\nThe main focus of interference networks and partially con- nected interference networks is on concrete understanding of small-scale networks and developing fundamental interference management techniques for basic communication blocks. In this paper, we address the question how the network connectiv- ity can affect the overall DoF of large-scale networks. Before specifying this question, we will brieﬂy introduce related works in large-scale networks.\n\u2022 Large-scale Networks: The primary goal of a large-scale network with n SD pairs is to characterize the capacity within O(log n) in the limit of large n. In their famous random model, Gupta and Kumar showed that nearest- neighbor multi-hop routing is optimal for power-limited networks [8]. For interference-limited networks, on the other hand, cooperative transmission between nodes are essentially required [9]. Notice that for both cases sources or destinations act as relays of other SD pairs . Randomly connected networks have been studied in [10]. It was shown that for certain connectivity distributions the ag- gregate rate of n (log n) d is achievable for some d > 0.\nFrom the large-scale network model perspective, any two nodes can be connected to each other through wireless chan- nels. In this sense, modeling large-scale networks as inter- ference networks or partially connected interference networks mentioned before cannot capture a potential beneﬁt of using sources or destinations as relays of other SD pairs, which can be seen in [8], [9]. Motivated by this aspect, we consider a network of n SD pairs in which any two nodes are connected to each other with a positive probability, independent of other node pairs. For fully connected networks, i.e., connectivity probabilities are one for all possible node pairs, direct or one- hop transmission without relaying is sufﬁcient both in terms of DoF and scaling law [11], [12]. We show that, on the other hand, as nodes are connected more sparsely to each other, relaying becomes a dominant strategy. We prove that, even for arbitrarily small connectivity probabilities, each SD pair can still achieve non-vanishing DoF in the limit of large n.\nThis means that very sparse connection is enough to provide a constant fraction of DoF for each SD pair. Notice that direct transmission with interference alignment leads to negligible DoF as connectivity probabilities become arbitrarily small.\nFor a vector A and a matrix B, A i denotes the ith element of A and B i,j denotes the (i, j)th element of B. For a set S, |S| denote the cardinality of S. Let N C (µ, σ 2 ) denote the circularly symmetric complex Gaussian distribution with mean µ and variance σ 2 .\nWe consider a network of n SD pairs. For simplicity, denote source i and destination i by node i and node n+i respectively, where i ∈ {1, · · · , n}.\n1) Full-duplex: For full-duplex nodes, the 2n × 1 dimen- sional output vector at time t is given by\nwhere H[t] is the 2n × 2n dimensional complex channel matrix, X[t] is the 2n × 1 dimensional input vector at time t, Z[t] is the 2n × 1 dimensional noise vector at time t. The elements of Z[t] are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) drawn from N C (0, 1) and each node should satisfy the average power constraint P . That is, 1 B B t=1 E [|X i [t]]| 2 ] ≤ P during B channel uses.\nWe assume that channel coefﬁcients vary independently over time . Speciﬁcally, the (i, j)th element of H[t] is given by\nwhere e i,j [t]\u2019s are independently drawn having one with probability p i,j ∈ (0, 1] and zero with probability 1 − p i,j and h i,j [t]\u2019s are again independently drawn from continuous distributions. Hence, as the connectivity probabilities p i,j \u2019s decrease, the considered network becomes more sparsely connected. We further assume that global channel state in- formation H[t] is available for each node at time t.\n2) Half-duplex: The network model and assumptions are the same as those of full-duplex except that each node can either transmit or receive at a given time, but not simultane- ously. Based on (1), we can deﬁne the input\u2013output relation of half-duplex nodes. Assuming that, at given time t, the set of nodes N (t) ⊆ {1, · · · , 2n} transmit and the set of the rest of nodes N (t) c = {1, · · · , 2n} \\ N (t) receive, the input\u2013output relation is given by\nwhere the | N (t) c | × 1 dimensional output vector at time t is given by {Y i [t]} i∈N (t) c , the | N (t) c | × |N (t)| di- mensional complex channel matrix H N (t) [t] is given by {H i,j [t]} i∈N (t) c ,j∈N (t) , the | N (t)| × 1 dimensional input vec- tor at time t is given by {X j [t]} j∈N (t) , and the | N (t) c | × 1 dimensional noise vector at time t is given by {Z i [t]} i∈N (t) c .\nWe consider a set of length- B block codes. Let W i be the message of source i uniformly distributed over {1, · · · , 2 BR i }, where R i is the rate of source i. A rate tuple (R 1 , · · · , R n ) is said to be achievable if there exists a sequence of (2 BR 1 , · · · , 2 BR n ; B) codes such that the probabilities of error for W 1 to W n converge to zero as B increases. Then, for an achievable rate tuple (R 1 , · · · , R n ), the sum DoF of\nis achievable. Throughout the paper, we will characterize an achievable per-user DoF d Σ n in the limit of large n.\nWe ﬁrst introduce our main results here and then explain the achievability in the next section.\nWe characterize an achievable DoF for both full-duplex and half-duplex in the limit of large n.\nTheorem 1 (Time-varying connectivity): Consider a net- work of n SD pairs with time-varying connectivity. Let p d = min j∈{1,··· ,n} {p n+j,j } > 0. For sufﬁciently large n,\nis achievable with probability approaching one, where δ 1,n and δ 2,n converge to zero as n increases.\nAs shown in Theorem 1, for any set of non-zero connectivity probabilities, a constant fraction of DoF is achievable for each SD pair (at least 1/3 for full-duplex and 1/4 for half-duplex). This result shows that vary sparse connections between nodes is enough to guarantee non-vanishing DoF for each SD pair even as the number of SD pairs tend to inﬁnity. For more details, we introduce the following example.\nExample 1 (Comparision): Suppose that p n+j,j = p > 0 for all j ∈ {1, · · · , n}. Then, from Theorem 1,\nis achievable with probability approaching one. Consider the direct transmission in which only a subset of sources hav- ing direct connections to their destinations send messages through their direct channels. Then we can apply interference alignment [2] to this one-hop transmission and each of the corresponding SD pairs achieves 1/2 DoF. Since the number of SD pairs having direct connections is approximately given by np with probability approaching one as n increases,\nis achievable with probability approaching one for both full- duplex and half-duplex in this case. Fig. 1 plots (3) and\n(4) with respect to p ∈ (0, 1]. As p decreases, our result provides signiﬁcant DoF improvement compared to the direct transmission.\nThe results presented in Section III-A dealt with con- nectivity probabilities in (0, 1], that are not scaled with n. Obviously, if p i,j = 0, every node is isolated to each other and\n= 0. In this subsection, we consider scalable connectivity probabilities, i.e., the connectivity probabilities p i,j (n)\u2019s are functions of n. The following theorem shows a sufﬁcient condition on p i,j (n)\u2019s guaranteeing non-vanishing DoF for each SD pair.\nTheorem 2 (Scalable p i,j (n)): Consider a network of n SD pairs with time-varying connectivity. If there exist increasing sequences a i,j (n) > 0 such that p i,j (n) = a i,j (n) log n n for all i, j ∈ {1, · · · , 2n}, then for sufﬁciently large n,\nis achievable with probability approaching one, where δ 3,n and δ 4,n converge to zero as n increases.\nThis theorem shows that the connectivity probabilities can indeed decrease slower than the order of log n n while preserving a constant fraction of DoF for each SD pair, independent of n.\nFor static connectivity, we show that similar results pre- sented in Section III-A still hold. In this case, once H[t] in (1) is drawn according to (2), they remain ﬁxed during the entire transmission. The following theorem shows an achievable DoF for static connectivity.\nTheorem 3 (Static conectivity): Consider a network of n SD pairs with static connectivity. Let n d be the number of SD pairs having direct connections. For sufﬁciently large n,\nThe same statement that, for any connectivity probabilities in [0, 1), each SD pair can achieve a constant DoF (at least 1/3\nfor full-duplex and 1/4 for half-duplex) is true for static con- nectivity. Furthermore, if p n+j,j = p for all j ∈ {1, · · · , n}, then Theorem 3 coincides with the result in (3).\nDue to the page limitation, we show the achievability of Theorem 1 for full-duplex nodes. For simplicity, \u2018with probability one\u2019 in this section means that the probability approaches to one as n increases.\nThe achievability is based on the two-hop transmission with decode-and-forward (DF) relaying and over each-hop we adopt interference alignment in [2] . As shown in Example 1, relaying is essentially required to improve DoF of sparsely connected networks. From the result of matching in bipartite random graphs , we can show that this two-hop transmission with DF relying is enough to utilize a constant fraction of nodes with probability one for each hop transmission and, as a result, a constant fraction of d Σ n is achievable with probability one.\nBefore proving Theorem 1 for full-duplex, we introduce matching in bipartite random graphs. Denote a bipartite graph by G = (U, V, E) in which U and V are sets of vertices and E is the set of edges. A bipartite graph G = (U, V, E) with |U | = |V | = m is said to contain a perfect matching if for each U i , i ∈ {1, · · · , m}, there exists a distinguishable V j having an edge (U i , V j ). The following theorem shows the existence of a perfect matching for a bipartite random graph in the limit of large m.\nTheorem 4: Consider a bipartite random graph G = (U, V, E) with |U | = |V | = m in which there is an edge between U j and V i with probability q i,j ∈ (0, 1] if i = j, independent of each other, and with probability zero otherwise. For sufﬁciently large m, G contains a perfect matching with probability approaching one.\nProof: The overall proof is based on Theorem 3.25 in [13]. The only differences are that q i,j are not the same and there is no edge between U i and V i .\nIn this subsection, we prove Theorem 1 assuming full- duplex nodes.\n1) Construction of bipartite graphs: Denote p min = min i,j∈{1,··· ,2n} {p i,j } and n 1 = np d − √ n log n, where p d = min i∈{1,··· ,n} {p n+i,i }. Deﬁne a random variable e i,j [t] such that P [e i,j [t] = 1] is equal to p d /p i,j if i = n + j and p min /p i,j otherwise. Then deﬁne the 2n × 2n dimensional connectivity matrix E [t] such that E i,j [t] = e i,j [t]e i,j [t]. Hence\np d \t if i = n + j, p min otherwise .\nDeﬁne S [1] [t] ⊆ {1, · · · , n} as the set of sources such that | S [1] [t]| = n 1 and E n+S [1]\ni ∈ {1, · · · , n 1 }. If there are multiple sets satisfying this condition, we choose one of them uniformly at random. Denote D [1] [t] = {n + i|i ∈ S [1] [t]} as the set of the corresponding destinations. Let S [2] [t] = {1, · · · , n} \\ S [1] [t] and D [2] [t] = {n + 1, · · · , 2n} \\ D [1] [t].\nNow construct a bipartite graph G [d2,s2] [t] \t = (S [2] [t], D [2] [t], E [d2,s2] [t]) such that there is an edge between S [2] j [t] and D [2] i [t] if E D [2]\n[t] = 1 for i, j ∈ {1, · · · , n − n 1 }, i = j. Hence G [d2,s2] [t] has an edge between S [2] j [t] and D [2] i [t] with probability p min if i = j, independent of each other, and with probability zero otherwise. Similarly, construct G [s2,s2] [t] = (S [2] [t], S [2] [t], E [s2,s2] [t]) such that there is an edge between S [2] j [t] and S [2] i [t] if\n[t] = 1 for i, j ∈ {1, · · · , n − n 1 }, i = j and G [d2,d2] [t] = (D [2] [t], D [2] [t], E [d2,d2] [t]) such that there is an edge between D [2] j [t] and D [2] i [t] if E D [2]\n[t] = 1 for i, j ∈ {1, · · · , n − n 1 }, i = j. These bipartite graphs will be used to ﬁnd a set of relays for two-hop transmission.\nLet n d [t] = i∈{1,··· ,n} E n+i,i [t]. From Chebyshev\u2019s in- equality,\nwhere σ 2 = p d (1 − p d ) is a variance of E n+i,i [t]. Then, by setting 1 = log n n , we have np d −\nn log n ≤ n d [t] ≤ np d + √ n log n with probability one. Hence n 1 ≤ n d [t] with probability one and, therefore, we can ﬁnd S [1] [t] with probability one. Also, | S [2] [t]| = n−n 1 → ∞ as n → ∞ with probability one. Hence, from Theorem 4, each of G [d2,s2] [t], G [s2,s2] [t], and G [d2,d2] [t] contains a perfect matching with probability one. Let M (G [d2,s2] [t]) as the resulting perfect matching set, which is the permutation set of D [2] [t] with respect to S [2] [t]. If there are multiple matching sets, we choose one of them uniformly at random. Similarly, deﬁne M (G [s2,s2] [t]), and M (G [d2,d2] [t]).\nFor transmission, we will only use the time indices that the connectivities satisfy the above conditions, which holds with probability one. Hence the fractional loss on DoF becomes negligible as n increases. For simplicity, the connectivity at each time is assumed to satisfy the above conditions from now on.\n2) Interference alignment based on two-hop relaying: The proposed scheme is operated over three blocks with length- B each. Let n [1] (l) be the total number of messages transmitted by each source when it belongs to S [1] [t] for t ∈ {(l − 1)B + 1, · · · , lB}, where l ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Similarly, let n [2] (l) be the total number of messages transmitted by each source when it belongs to S [2] [t] for t ∈ {(l − 1)B + 1, · · · , lB}, where l ∈ {1, 2}. Hence the total number of messages transmitted by all sources during three blocks is given by n 3 l=1 n [1] (l) + 2 l=1 n [2] (l) . The values of n [1] (l) and n [2] (l) will be speciﬁed later. The detailed transmission for each block is follows.\n\u2022 (First block) For t ∈ {1, · · · , B}, S [1] i [t] transmits one of n [1] (1) messages to D [1] i [t] and S [2] j [t] transmits one of n [2] (1) messages to M j (G [d2,s2] [t]), which is not the ﬁnal destination of S [2] j [t], where i ∈ {1, · · · , n 1 } and j ∈ {1, · · · , n − n 1 }.\n\u2022 (Second block) For t ∈ {B + 1, · · · , 2B}, S [1] i [t] trans- mits one of n [1] (2) messages to D [1] i [t], S [2] j [t] transmits one of n [2] (2) messages to M j (G [s2,s2] [t]), which is not the ﬁnal destination of S [2] j [t], and D [2] j [t] trans- mits one of the received messages from the source of M j (G [d2,d2] [t]) to the ﬁnal destination M j (G [d2,d2] [t]), where i ∈ {1, · · · , n 1 } and j ∈ {1, · · · , n − n 1 }.\n\u2022 (Third block) For t ∈ {2B+1, · · · , 3B}, S [1] i [t] transmits one of n [1] (3) messages to D [1] i [t] and S [2] j [t] trans- mits one of the received messages from the source of M j (G [d2,s2] [t]) to the ﬁnal destination M j (G [d2,s2] [t]), where i ∈ {1, · · · , n 1 } and j ∈ {1, · · · , n − n 1 }.\nFor the ﬁrst and third blocks, i.e., t ∈ {1, · · · , B, 2B + 1, · · · , 3B}, the overall transmission at given time t can be re- garded as the n-user interference channel from (S [1] [t], S [2] [t]) to (D [1] [t], M (G [d2,s2] [t])) having direct connections as shown in Fig. 2. Similarly, for the second block, i.e., t ∈ {B + 1, · · · , 2B}, it can be regarded as the (2n − n 1 )- user interference channel from (S [1] [t], S [2] [t], D [2] [t]) to (D [1] [t], M (G [s2,s2] [t]), M (G [d2,d2] [t])) having direct connec- tions as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, by applying interference alignment in [2] at each message transmission, 1/2 DoF is achievable for each of message transmission.\n3) Achievable DoF: For the proposed message transmis- sion, each source or destination acts as a relay of other SD pairs. Therefore, n [1] (l) and n [2] (l) should be carefully chosen guaranteeing that all messages are delivered to their ﬁnal destinations. Let n i,j (l) denote the maximum number of messages of source j that node i can receive during the l-th block, where i ∈ {1, · · · , 2n}, j ∈ {1, · · · , n}, and l ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Then all messages can be delivered to their ﬁnal destinations if the following conditions are satisﬁed:\nfor j ∈ {1, · · · , n}, l ∈ {1, 2}. Let q i,j (l) denote the prob- ability that node i can receive a message of the j-th source at a given time in the l-th block, where i ∈ {1, · · · , 2n}, j ∈ {1, · · · , n}, and l ∈ {1, 2, 3}. From the transmission scheme described before,\n  \n \ni ∈ {n + 1, · · · , 2n}, i = n + j, 0 \t otherwise ,\n     \n    \ni ∈ {n + 1, · · · , 2n}, i = n + j, 0 \t otherwise ,\nand q i,j (3) = q i,j (1). From the strong typicality lemma in [14], the probability that n i,j (l) B − q i,j (l) ≤ 2 for all i ∈ {1, · · · , 2n}, j ∈ {1, · · · , n}, and l ∈ {1, 2, 3} is greater than\nfor j ∈ {1, · · · , n}, l ∈ {1, 2} with probability one. Therefore setting n [1] (l) = n 4 n 1 − n 4 / log n for all l ∈ {1, 2, 3} and n [2] (l) = n 4 (n − n 1 ) − n 5 / log n for all l ∈ {1, 2} satisﬁes the conditions (5) and (6) with probability one. In conclusion,\n6bn = 1 3 + p d 6 − δ 1,n\nRemark 1: The underlying approach of the proposed two- hop relaying is similar to the scheme in [15]. For both cases, at the ﬁrst phase, each node receives messages from multiple sources when appropriate connectivities or channel gains occur and then, at the second phase, it delivers the received messages to the ﬁnal destinations when appropriate connectivities or channel gains occur.\nRemark 2: The relaying approach presented in this paper is also beneﬁcial for fully connected fading networks. Con- sider a fully connected network in which H i,j [t]\u2019s are i.i.d. drawn from N C (0, 1). If we directly apply ergodic interference alignment in [3] from the sources to the destinations (one- hop transmission), n i=1 R i n \t = 1 2 E 1 + 2|H n+1,1 [1]| 2 P is achievable, where the expectation is over the channel coefﬁ- cient. Hence the achievable rate for each SD pair is not scaled with n. Instead, we can construct a hypothetical connection between two nodes if their channel gain is greater than a certain threshold, and then apply the same two-hop relaying in Section IV with ergodic interference alignment for each hop transmission. This two-hop relaying can provide that n i=1 R i n\nscales as log log n as n increases. It was ﬁrst shown in [12] that log log n rate scaling is achievable by ergodic interference alignment using the channel gains greater than a threshold. We\ncan prove the same log log n gain with different relaying (or scheduling) presented in Section IV.\nThis work has been supported in part by the European ERC Starting Grant 259530-ComCom."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"V.
