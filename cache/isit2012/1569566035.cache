Its main purpose is to increase the communication rates across the network and to increase reliability of time-varying links. It is known that wireless communication from a source to a destination can beneﬁt from the cooperation of nodes that overhear the transmission. The classical single relay channel [1] exempliﬁes this situation. Further work on the relay channel in [2] and [3] has enabled substantial performance improvement.\nHowever, there is evidence that additional gains can be achieved with \u201cnetwork-layer\u201d cooperation (or packet-level cooperation), that is plain relaying without any physical layer considerations [4] and [5]. In this work, we focus on this type of cooperation. The work in [6] investigated the network-level cooperation in a network consisting of a source and a relay by considering the cases of full or no cooperation at the relay. A key difference between physical-layer and network-layer cooperation ideas is that the objective rate function that is maximized is the so-called stable throughput region which captures the bursty nature of trafﬁc from the source. In [6], it was shown that the stability region of full cooperation under random-access does not always strictly contain the non- cooperative stability region.\nThe main contribution in this paper is to introduce the notion of partial network-level cooperation by adding a ﬂow controller for the trafﬁc coming to the relay from the source. We prove that the system is always better than or at least equal to the system without the ﬂow controller. Speciﬁcally, we provide an exact characterization of the stability region of a network consisting of a source, a relay and a destination node as shown in Fig. 1. We consider the collision channel with erasures and random access of the medium. The source and\nthe relay node have external arrivals; furthermore, the relay is forwarding part of the source node\u2019s trafﬁc to the destination. Unlike the work in [6], the relay node is equipped with a ﬂow controller that regulates the internal arrivals from the source based on the conditions in the network to ensure the stability of the queues. We characterize the stable throughput region under conditions of no cooperation at all, full cooperation, and probabilistic (opportunistic) cooperation. By probabilistic cooperation we mean that under certain conditions in the network, the relay may accept a packet from the source. The characterization of the stability regions is known to be challenging because the queues of the users are coupled (i.e., the service process of a queue depends on the status of the other queues). A tool that bypasses this difﬁculty is the stochastic dominance technique [7].\nWe consider a time-slotted system in which the nodes are randomly accessing a common receiver as shown in Fig. 1. We denote with S, R, and D the source, the relay and the destination, respectively. Packet trafﬁc originates from S and R. Because of the wireless broadcast nature, R may receive some of the packets transmitted from S and then relay those packets to D. The packets from S which failed to be received by D but were successfully received by R are relayed by R. As we impose half-duplex constraint, R can overhear S only when it is idle. Each node has an inﬁnite size buffer for storing incoming packets, and the transmission of each packet occupies one time slot. Node R has separate queues for the exogenous arrivals and the endogenous arrivals that are relayed through R. But, we can let R to maintain a single queue and merge all the arrivals into a single queue as the achievable stable throughput region is not affected [6]. This is because\n− p 13 ) + (1 − q 1 )p 23 q 1 [p 13 + (1 − p 13 )p 12 ]\nthe link quality between R and D is independent of which packet is selected for transmission.\nThe packet arrival processes at S and R are assumed to be Bernoulli with rates λ 1 and λ 2 , respectively, and are independent of each other. Node R is equipped with a ﬂow controller that regulates the rate of endogenous arrivals from S by randomly accepting the incoming packets with probability p a ; that is, it controls the amount of cooperation that it is willing to provide. In each time slot, nodes S and R attempt to transmit with probabilities q 1 and q 2 , respectively, if their queues are not empty. Decisions on transmission are made independently among the nodes. We assumed collision channel with erasures in which, if both S and R transmit in the same time slot, a collision occurs and both transmissions fail. The probability that a packet transmitted by node i is successfully decoded at node j( ̸= i) is denoted by p ij which is the probability that the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over the speciﬁed link exceeds a certain threshold for the successful decoding. These erasure probabilities capture the effect of random fading at the physical layer. The probabilities p 13 , p 23 , and p 12 denote the success probabilities over the link S − R, R − D, and S − R, respectively. Node R has a better channel to D than S, that is p 23 > p 13 .\nThe cooperation is performed at the protocol level as follows. When S transmits a packet, if D decodes the packet successfully, it sends an ACK and the packet exits the network; if D fails to decode the packet but R does and the ﬂow controller decides to relay the packet, then R sends an ACK and takes over the responsibility of delivering the packet to D by placing it in its queue. If neither D nor R decode (or if R does not store the packet), the packet remains in S\u2019s queue for retransmission. The ACKs are assumed to be error-free, instantaneous and broadcasted to all relevant nodes.\nDenote by Q t i the length of queue i at the beginning of time slot t. Based on the deﬁnition in [8], the queue is said to be stable if\nLoynes\u2019 theorem [9] states that if the arrival and service processes of a queue are strictly jointly stationary and the average arrival rate is less than the average service rate, then the queue is stable. If the average arrival rate is greater than the average service rate, then the queue is unstable and the\nvalue of Q t i approaches inﬁnity almost surely. The stability region of the system is deﬁned as the set of arrival rate vectors λ = (λ 1 , λ 2 ) for which the queues in the system are stable.\nThis section describes the stability region for the system presented in the previous section and depicted in Fig. 1. The relay node R is equipped with a ﬂow controller, and the parameter p a of the ﬂow controller is the probability to accept for the received packet from the source S. So, our objective is to ﬁnd the optimum value of p a denoted by p ∗ a which maximizes the stability region. This value reﬂects the cooperation degree that maximizes the stability region.\nTheorem 3.1: The stability region of the opportunistic co- operative network depicted in Fig. 1 is described by:\n\u2022 The subregion R 1 is described as follows: \u2013 if q 1 < p 23 p\n, then p ∗ a = 1 and the region is given by Eq.(1).\n, then p ∗ a = 0 and the region is given by Eq.(2).\n\u2022 The subregion R 2 is described as follows: \u2013 if q 2 ≥ p 13 p\n, then p ∗ a = 1 and the region is given by Eq.(3).\n, then the subregion R 2 is R 2 = R \u2032 2 ∪ R \u2032\u2032 2 where:\n∗ if λ 1 < q 1 (1 − q 2 )p 13 , then p ∗ a = 0 and the region is given by Eq.(4).\nand the region is given by Eq.(5).\nAs seen in the theorem, there are three possible optimal val- ues of p a . When p ∗ a equals to 0 or 1, the relay rejects or accepts all the incoming trafﬁc from the source, respectively. The more interesting case is when q 2 < p 13 p\n(the relay transmission probability is less than a threshold which is a function of the channel success probabilities) and at the same time the average arrival rate at the source is λ 1 ≥ q 1 (1 −q 2 )p 13 ; in this case the optimum cooperation strategy is probabilistic routing by the relay. The incoming trafﬁc from the source is relayed in part,\nmeaning that the relay accepts a packet from the source with probability p ∗ a , where p ∗ a = λ 1 −q 1 (1 −q 2 )p 13 q\nThe intuition behind this result is that when the relay is not attempting to transmit \u201cvery often\u201d and at the same time, the arrival rate at the source is greater than a certain value, then the relay is cooperating only partially. Thus, p ∗ a controls the amount of cooperation.\nThe expressions for the average service rates seen by source S and relay R are given by:\nµ 2 = q 2 [1 − q 1 Pr(Q 1 ̸= 0)] p 23 \t (8) Since the average service rate of each queue µ 1 and µ 2 depends on the queue size of the other queue, they cannot be computed directly. We bypass this difﬁculty by utilizing the idea of stochastic dominance [7]; that is, we ﬁrst construct hypothetical dominant systems, in which one of the nodes transmits dummy packets even when its packet queue is empty. Since the queue sizes in the dominant system are, at all times, at least as large as those of the original system, the stability region of the dominant system inner-bounds that of the original system. It turns out, however, that the stability region obtained using this stochastic dominance technique coincides with that of the original system which will be discussed in detail later in this section. Thus, the stability regions for both the original and the dominant systems are the same.\nA. The ﬁrst dominant system: source node transmits dummy packets\nIn this sub-section we obtain the region R 1 of Theorem 3.1. We consider the ﬁrst dominant system, in which node S transmits dummy packets with probability q 1 whenever its queue is empty, while node R behaves in the same way as in the original system. All other assumptions remain unaltered in the dominant system. Thus, the service rate at the relay node is given by:\nµ Q 2 = q 2 (1 − q 1 ) p 23 \t (9) To derive the stability condition for the queue in the relay node, we need to calculate the total arrival rate. There are two independent arrival processes at the relay: the exogenous trafﬁc with arrival rate λ 2 and the endogenous trafﬁc from S. In the dominant system, when R receives a dummy packet from S, it simply discards that packet. When the dominant system is stable, the queue at S is stable, so the departure rate of the source packets (excluding the dummy ones) is equal to the arrival rate λ 1 . Denote by S A the event that S transmits a packet and the packet leaves the queue, then:\nAmong the packets that depart from the queue of S, some will exit the network because they are decoded by the destination directly, and some will be relayed by R. Denote by S B the event that the transmitted packet from S will be relayed from R, then:\nPr(S B ) = [(1 − q 2 )Pr(Q 2 ̸= 0) + Pr(Q 2 = 0)] (1 −p 13 )p 12 p a (11)\nThe conditional probability that a transmitted packet from S (dummy packets excluded) arrives at R given that the transmitted packet exits node S\u2019s queue is given by:\np 13 + (1 − p 13 )p 12 p a λ 1 \t (13) By Loyne\u2019s Theorem, the stability condition for queue 2 at node R is given by λ Q 2 < µ Q 2 and, thus:\nThe probability that the queue is not empty can be computed by Little\u2019s theorem and is given by:\nq 2 (1 − q 1 ) p 23 \t (15) Thus, after substituting Eq.(15) into Eq.(7), the average service rate seen by S is\nThe stability condition for queue 1 at the source node is λ 1 < µ 1 , and after some algebra, we obtain:\n− p 13 )q 1 (1 − q 1 )p 23\n(1 − q 1 )p 23 \t λ 2 < q 1 [(1 − p 13 )p 12 p a + p 13 ] (17)\nAn important observation made in [7] is that the stability conditions obtained by using the stochastic dominance tech- nique are not merely sufﬁcient conditions for the stability of the original system but are sufﬁcient and necessary conditions. The indistinguishability argument applies to our problem as well. Based on the construction of the dominant system, it is easy to see that the queues of the dominant system are always larger in size than those of the original system, provided they are both initialized to the same value. Therefore, given λ 2 < µ 2 , if for some λ 1 , the queue at S is stable in the dominant system, then the corresponding queue in the original system must be stable; conversely, if for some λ 1 in the dominant system, the queue at node S saturates, then it will not transmit dummy packets, and as long as S has a packet to transmit, the behavior of the dominant system is identical to that of the original system because the dummy packet\ntransmissions are increasingly rare as we approach the stability boundary. Therefore, we can conclude that the original system and the dominant system are indistinguishable at the boundary points.\nNow we will ﬁnd the value of p a that maximizes λ 1 . After replacing λ 1 with y and λ 2 with x we have:\nq 1 p 12 (1 − p 13 )p a + (1 − q 1 )p 23 \t (18) when\np 13 + (1 − p 13 )p 12 p a y \t (19) After differentiating y with respect to p a , we have\nFrom Eq.(9), it is obvious that x −p 23 + p 23 q 1 < 0. If p 13 q 1 − p 23 + p 23 q 1 < 0, then we have that q 1 < p 23 p\n> 0 and y is an increasing function of p a and, thus p ∗ a = 1. Then, Eq.(19) becomes\np 13 + (1 − p 13 )p 12 y \t (22) and Eq.(18) becomes\nq 1 p 12 (1 − p 13 ) + (1 − q 1 )p 23 \t (23) The stability region for this case is given by Eq.(1). If q 1 >\n< 0 and, thus, y is a decreasing function of p a and p ∗ a = 0. Then Eq.(19) becomes\nB. The second dominant system: relay node transmits dummy packets\nIn this sub-section we obtain the region R 2 of Theorem 3.1. We consider the second dominant system, in which node R transmits dummy packets with probability q 2 whenever its queue is empty, while node S behaves in the same way as in the original system. All the other assumptions remain unaltered\nin the dominant system. The service rate for the source node is\n(28) The total arrival rate at the relay node is given by:\nwhere S A and S B are deﬁned in the previous sub-section. Note that Pr(S A ) = (1 − q 2 ) (p 13 + (1 − p 13 )p 12 p a ), Pr(S B ) = (1 − q 2 )(1 − p 13 )p 12 p a and, thus, we have Pr(S B |S A ) =\n. From the above it follows that the total arrival rate at the relay node is:\nThus, from Loyne\u2019s stability criterion, it follows that the queue is stable if λ Q 2 < µ Q 2 and, thus:\n(32) After some algebra, we obtain:\n(1 − q 2 ) [p 13 + (1 − p 13 )p 12 p a ] λ 1 < q 2 p 23 \t (33) The indistinguishability argument at saturations holds here as well. Next we ﬁnd the value of p a that maximizes λ 2 . After replacing λ 1 with x and λ 2 with y we have:\n(1 − q 2 ) [p 13 + (1 − p 13 )p 12 p a ] x = q 2 p 23 \t (34) After differentiating y with respect to p a we have\n< q 2 < 1 and y increases; thus p ∗ a = 1 and, therefore:\n, it follows that y decreases and thus p ∗ a = 0, hence:\nIf x ≥ q 1 (1 − q 2 )p 13 and x ≤ q 1 (1 − q 2 ) [p 13 + (1 − p 13 )p 12 p a ], it follows from Eq.(27) that\nq 1 (1 − q 2 )(1 − p 13 )p 12 \t (41) and\nIn this section, we obtain the stability region for the three cases of no-cooperation, full cooperation and partial coopera- tion and we compare them in a numerical illustration where p a < 1. We let q 1 = 0.2, q 2 = 0.3, p 13 = 0.5, p 12 = 0.9, and p 23 = 0.8. In Fig. 2, we show the stability regions for the three cases. The region of partial cooperation contains the regions of the other cases. The boundaries of the stability region for the partial cooperation scheme is described by the line segments ABCD, and contains the region of non-cooperation (ABF ) and the full cooperation (ACD). The triangular area BEC in Fig. 2 is achieved only by the partial cooperation scheme, showing that this scheme is superior compared to the rest schemes.\nThe line segment AB belongs to the stability region of both no-cooperation and partial cooperation schemes. It is the boundary when λ 1 ≤ 0.07 (which is the average arrival rate at the source) and, corresponds to the scheme of no-cooperation or when p ∗ a = 0. The line segment CD is the boundary for\nthe stability region for full cooperation and partial cooperation with p ∗ a = 1 schemes when 0.133 ≤ λ 1 < 0.1666. The most interesting case is the BC segment. This boundary is achieved only by the partial cooperation scheme. The value of p ∗ a that achieves the boundary is p ∗ a = λ 1 −0.07 0.063 , as 0.07 < λ 1 < 0.133. In this case the relay, through the ﬂow controller, regulates the endogenous trafﬁc from the source by randomly accepting (with p ∗ a ) the packets from the source. Note that as λ 1 increases (in the interval (0.07, 0.133)) so does p ∗ a . The values of p ∗ a that achieve the boundaries of the regions are given in Table I.\nThe intuition behind these results, is that when the trafﬁc level at the source is relatively low, the optimal scheme for the relay is not to cooperate at all. When the trafﬁc level at the source is high, the best scheme is to fully cooperate, Finally, when the source has an intermediate level of trafﬁc, the optimal scheme is to partially offer relay services.\nWe introduced the notion of partial network-level coopera- tion by assuming a ﬂow controller for the endogenous trafﬁc to the relay from the source node of the network in Fig. 1. We provided an exact characterization of the stability region for this network. We proved that the system with the ﬂow controller is always better than or at least equal to the system without the ﬂow controller. The ﬂow controller regulates the degree of cooperation offered by the relay."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"E. C. V. D.
