Started in the 1950\u2019s in the form of ripple control for load and tariff management in power distribution, this low bandwidth one-way communication system has evolved to a two-way communication system in the 1980\u2019s. With the emer- gence of the Internet in the 1990\u2019s, research into broadband PLC gathered pace as a promising technology for Internet access and local area networking, since the electrical grid infrastructure provides \u201clast mile\u201d connectivity to premises and capillarity within premises. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in high-speed narrowband PLC due to applications in sustainable energy strategies, speciﬁcally in smart grids (see [1]\u2013[4]).\nHowever, power lines present a difﬁcult communications environment and overcoming permanent narrowband distur- bance has remained a challenging problem [5]\u2013[7]. Vinck [5] addressed this problem by showing that multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK) modulation, in conjunction with the use of a permutation code having minimum (Hamming) distance d, is able to correct up to d−1 errors due to narrowband noise. Since then, more general codes such as constant-composition codes, frequency permutation arrays, and injection codes (see [8]\u2013[23]) have been considered as possible replacements for permutation codes in PLC. Versfeld et al. [24], [25] later introduced the notion of \u2018same-symbol weight\u2019 (henceforth, termed as symbol weight) of a code as a measure of the capa- bility of a code in dealing with narrowband noise. They also showed empirically that low symbol weight cosets of Reed- Solomon codes outperform normal Reed-Solomon codes in the presence of narrowband noise and additive white Gaussian noise. Inﬁnite families of optimal codes with minimum symbol weight were constructed by Chee et al. [26] recently.\nUnfortunately, symbol weight alone is not sufﬁcient to capture the performance of a code in dealing with permanent narrowband noise. The purpose of this paper is to extend the analysis of Vinck\u2019s coded modulation scheme based on permutation codes (see [5], [27, Subsection 5.2.4]) to gen- eral codes. In the process, we introduce an additional new parameter that more precisely captures a code\u2019s performance against permanent narrowband noise. This parameter is related to symbol equity, the uniformity of frequencies of symbols in each codeword. Codes designed taking into account this new parameter are shown to perform better than general ones.\nFor a positive integer n, the set {1, 2, . . . , n} is denoted by [n]. For X a ﬁnite set and k an integer, 0 ≤ k ≤ |X|, the set of all k-subsets of X is denoted X k .\nLet Σ be a set of q symbols. A q-ary code C of length n over the alphabet Σ is a subset of Σ n . Elements of C are called codewords . The size of C is the number of codewords in C. For i ∈ [n], the ith coordinate of a codeword u is denoted by u i , so that u = (u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u n ).\nThe composition of u ∈ Σ n is a vector (w σ (u)) σ∈Σ , where w σ (u) is the number of times the symbol σ appears among the coordinates of u, that is,\nA code has bounded symbol weight r if all its codewords have symbol weight at most r. A code C has constant symbol weight r if all its codewords have symbol weight exactly r. Note that for any u ∈ Σ n , we have swt(u) ≥ n/q . A code has minimum symbol weight if it has constant symbol weight\nAn element u ∈ Σ n is said to have equitable symbol weight if w σ (u) ∈ { n/q , n/q } for all σ ∈ Σ. If all the codewords of C have equitable symbol weight, then the code C is called an equitable symbol weight code. Note that every equitable symbol weight code is also a minimum symbol weight code. The following lemma shows that for any u ∈ Σ n having equitable symbol weight, the number of symbols occurring with frequency n/q in u is uniquely determined. Hence, the frequencies of symbols in an equitable symbol weight codeword are as uniformly distributed as possible.\nLemma 2.1: Let u ∈ Σ n , r = n/q , and t = qr − n. If u has equitable symbol weight, then there are (q − t) symbols each appearing exactly r times and the remaining t symbols each appearing exactly r − 1 times in u, that is,\n|{σ ∈ Σ : w σ (u) = r}| = q − t, |{σ ∈ Σ : w σ (u) = r − 1}| = t.\nProof: Let x = |{σ ∈ Σ : w σ (u) = r}| and y = |{σ ∈ Σ : w σ (u) = r − 1}|. Then the following equations hold:\nx + y = q, rx + (r − 1)y = n.\nConsider the usual (Hamming) distance deﬁned on code- words and codes. A q-ary code of length n and distance d is called an (n, d) q -code, while a q-ary code of length n having bounded symbol weight r and distance d is called an (n, d, r) q - symbol weight code , and a q-ary equitable symbol weight code of length n and distance d is called an (n, d) q -equitable symbol weight code .\nIn coded modulation for power line communications [5], a q-ary code of length n is used, whose symbols are modulated using q-ary MFSK. The receiver demodulates the received signal using an envelope detector to obtain an output, which is then decoded by a decoder.\nFour detector/decoder combinations are possible: classical, modiﬁed classical, hard-decision threshold, and soft-decision threshold (see [27] for details). A soft-decision threshold detector/decoder requires exact channel state knowledge and is therefore not useful if we do not have channel state knowledge. Henceforth, we only consider the hard-decision threshold detector/decoder here, since it contains more information about the received signal compared to the classical and modiﬁed classical ones. We note that in the case of the hard-decision threshold detector/decoder, the decoder used is a minimum distance decoder .\nLet C be an (n, d) q -code over alphabet Σ, and let u = (u 1 , . . . , u n ) be a codeword transmitted over the PLC channel. The received signal (which may contain errors caused by noise) is demodulated to give an output v = (v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v n ) ∈\n2 Σ n , where 2 Σ denotes the collection of all subsets of Σ. Note that each v i is a subset of Σ. The errors that arise from the different types of noises in the channel (see [27, pp. 222\u2013 223]) have the following effects on the output of the detector.\n1) Let 1 ≤ e ≤ q. If e narrowband noise errors occur, then there is a set of e symbols contained in every v i , that is, | ∩ n i=1 v i | ≥ e.\n2) Let 1 ≤ e ≤ q. If e signal fading errors occur, then there are e symbols, none of which appears in any v i , that is, (∪ n i=1 v i ) ∩ Γ = ∅ for some Γ ∈ Σ e .\n3) Let 1 ≤ e ≤ n. If e impulse noise errors occur, then there is a set Π ∈ [n] e of e positions such that v i = Σ for all i ∈ Π.\n4) Let 1 ≤ e ≤ n(q − 1). If e insertion errors occur, then there is a set Ω ∈ [n]×Σ e such that for each (i, σ) ∈ Ω, v i contains σ and σ = u i .\n5) Let 1 ≤ e ≤ n. If e deletion errors occur, then there is a set Π ∈ [n] e of e positions that that v i does not contain u i for all i ∈ Π.\nBoth insertion and deletion errors are due to background noise. Example 3.1: The same detector output can arise from\ndifferent combinations of error types. Suppose u = (1, 2, 3, 4). A signal fading error of symbol 1 and a deletion error at position 1 would each result in the same detector output of v = (∅, {2}, {3}, {4}).\nWe also extend the deﬁnition of distance so that for C ⊆ Σ n , we have d(C, v) = min u∈C d(u, v). Given v ∈ (2 Σ ) n , a minimum distance decoder (for a code C) outputs a codeword u ∈ C which has the smallest distance to v, that is, a minimum distance decoder returns an element of\nBelow, we study the conditions under which a minimum distance decoder outputs the correct codeword, that is, when arg min\ncoder correctly outputs u if and only if d(C \\{u}, v) > d(u, v). Let d = d(C \\ {u}, u). Since C has distance d, we have\n\u2022 Let 1 ≤ e ≤ n. If e impulse noise errors occur, then d(u, v) = 0 and d(C \\ {u}, v) ≥ d − e.\n\u2022 Let 1 ≤ e ≤ n(q − 1). If e insertion errors occur, then d(u, v) = 0 and d(C \\ {u}, v) ≥ d − e.\nFor errors due to narrowband noise and signal fading, we deﬁne the function E C : [q] → [n] by\nThe quantity E C (e) measures the maximum number of coordi- nates over all codewords that can be affected by e narrowband noise and/or fading errors. The following is now immediate:\n\u2022 Let 1 ≤ e ≤ q. If e narrowband noise errors occur, then d(u, v) = 0 and d(C \\ {u}, v) ≥ d − E C (e).\n\u2022 Let 1 ≤ e ≤ q. If e signal fading errors occur, then d(u, v) ≤ E C (e) and d(C \\ {u}, v) = d .\nHence, if we denote by e NBD , e SFD , e IMP , e INS , and e DEL the number of errors due to narrowband noise, signal fading, impulse noise, insertion, and deletion, respectively, we have\nthe inequality (1) reduces to d(u, v) < d(C \\ {u}, v), which implies correct decoding.\nsay e IMP = d, and u, w ∈ C is such that d(u, w) = d (since C has distance d, u, w must exist), then d = d(C \\ {u}, u) = d, and we have d(u, v) − d(C \\ {u}, v) ≤ d − d = 0. In this case, the correctness of the decoder output cannot be guaranteed. We therefore have the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.1: Let C be an (n, d) q -code over alphabet Σ. Let e DEL , e IMP , e INS ∈ [n] and e NBD , e SFD ∈ [q]. Then C is able to correct e NBD narrowband noise errors, e SFD signal fading errors, e IMP impulse noise errors, e INS insertion errors, and e DEL deletion errors if and only if\nTherefore, the parameters n, q, d, and r (symbol weight) of a code are insufﬁcient to characterize the total error-correcting capability of a code in a PLC system, since E C cannot be speciﬁed by n, q, d, and r alone. We now introduce an additional new parameter that together with n, q, and d, more precisely captures the error-correcting capability of a code for PLC.\nDeﬁnition 3.1: Let C be a code of distance d. The narrow- band noise and signal fading error-correcting capability of C is\nFrom Theorem 3.1 we infer that a code C can correct up to c(C)−1 narrowband noise and signal fading errors. In general, for codes C with bounded symbol weight r, we have d/r ≤ c(C) ≤ min{d, q}. However, the gap between the upper and lower bounds can be large. Furthermore, the lower bound can be attained, giving codes of low resilience against narrowband noise, as is shown in the following example.\nExample 3.2: The code C = {(1, . . . , 1\nis a (q + r − 1, r + 1, r) q -symbol weight code with nar- rowband noise and signal fading error-correcting capability c(C) = d/r = 2.\nIn the next section, we provide a tight upper bound for c(C) and demonstrate that equitable symbol weight codes attain this upper bound.\nIf C is a code of length n with bounded symbol weight r, then E C (1) = r, and E C (e) ≥ min{n, r + e − 1} for e > 1. If C is restricted to more speciﬁc classes of codes, E C can be determined precisely. In the following, C is a q-ary code of length n over Σ = [q].\n1) When q|n, we have E C (e) = ne/q for all e ∈ [q] if and only if C is a frequency permutation array.\ne, for all e ∈ [n] n, otherwise\nif and only if C is an injection code. In particular, when q = n, this gives E C (e) = e for all e ∈ [q] if and only if C is a permutation code.\n3) Let (c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c q ) ∈ [n] q with c 1 ≥ c 2 ≥ · · · ≥ c q . If for each u ∈ C, we have w j (u) = c j for all j ∈ [q], then E C (e) = e i=1 c i for all e ∈ [q]. Such a code is a constant-composition code.\n4) If C is an equitable symbol weight code, then from Lemma 2.1,\nE C (e) = re, \t if e ≤ q − t r(q − t) + (e − q + t)(r − 1), otherwise,\nFor c(C) to be large, E C must be slow growing. We seek codes C for which E C is as slow growing as possible. Fix n, q, and let F n,q be the (ﬁnite) family of functions\nIf f ∈ F n,q , then f is a monotone increasing function with f (q) = n. Deﬁne the order on F n,q so that f g if either f (e) = g(e) for all e ∈ [q], or there exists 2 e ∈ [q] such that f (e) = g(e) for all e ≤ e − 1 and f (e ) < g(e ).\nre, \t if 1 ≤ e ≤ q − t r(q − t) + (e − q + t)(r − 1), otherwise,\nwhere r = n/q and t = qr − n. Then f ∗ n,q is the unique least element in F n,q with respect to the total order .\nProof: Since is total, it sufﬁces to establish that f ∗ n,q f for all f ∈ F n,q , and that f ∗ n,q ∈ F n,q .\nLet f = E C ∈ F n,q , where C is a q-ary code of length n over the alphabet [q]. Let u ∈ C. By permuting symbols\nif necessary, we may assume that w 1 (u) ≥ w 2 (u) ≥ · · · ≥ w q (u). We show that for all e ∈ [q],\nThis would then imply E C (e) ≥ f ∗ n,q (e) for all e ∈ [q], and consequently f f ∗ n,q .\nSuppose on the contrary that e i=1 w i (u) < f ∗ n,q (e) for some e ∈ [q]. If e ≤ q − t, then we have e i=1 w i (u) < re and r − 1 ≥ w e (u) ≥ w j (u) for j ≥ e + 1. Hence,\nSimilarly, when e > q − t, we have e i=1 w i (u) < r(q − t)+(e−q +t)(r −1) and r−1 ≥ w e (u) ≥ w j (u) for j ≥ e+1. Hence,\n< r(q − t) + (e − q + t)(r − 1) + (q − e)(r − 1) = qr − t = n,\nThe proposition then follows by noting that f ∗ n,q ∈ F n,q , since E C = f ∗ n,q when C is a q-ary equitable symbol weight code of length n.\nCorollary 4.1: C is a q-ary equitable symbol weight code of length n if and only if E C = f ∗ n,q .\nProof: If C is a q-ary equitable symbol weight code of length n, we have already determined that E C = f ∗ n,q . Hence, it only remains to show that E C = f ∗ n,q implies C is a q-ary equitable symbol weight code of length n. Let u ∈ C and we follow the notations in the proof of Proposition 4.1. Equality holds in (2) if and only if w i (u) = r for 1 ≤ i ≤ q − t and w i (u) = r − 1, otherwise. That is, u has equitable symbol weight. Hence, C is an equitable symbol weight code.\nIt follows that an equitable symbol weight code C gives E C of the slowest growth rate. This is the desired condition for correcting as many narrowband noise and signal fading errors as possible.\nWe end this section with a tight upper bound on c(C). Corollary 4.2: Let C be an (n, d) q -code. Then\nThe results in this section establish that an equitable symbol weight code has the best narrowband noise and signal fading error-correcting capability, among codes of the same distance and symbol weight.\nIn this section, we show via simulations the difference in performance between equitable symbol weight codes and (non-equitable) minimum symbol weight codes in the presence of narrowband noise and signal fading. More speciﬁcally, we consider the following codes 3 .\nC ESW : (25, 24) 17 -equitable symbol weight code of size 51, D SW : (17, 17, 2) 16 -symbol weight code of size 16, and\nD ESW : (17, 17) 16 -equitable symbol weight code of size 16. We show that C ESW and D ESW achieve lower symbol error rates as compared to C SW and D SW , respectively, in a PLC channel with varying degrees of narrowband noise and signal fading levels.\nThe setup is as follows. Let p be a real number between 0 and 1. We simulate a PLC channel with the following characteristics:\n1) for each σ ∈ Σ, a narrowband noise or signal fading error occurs at symbol σ with probability p,\n2) for each i ∈ [n], an impulse noise error occurs at coordinate i with probability 0.1, and\n3) for each (σ, i) ∈ Σ × [n], an insertion/deletion error occurs at symbol σ, coordinate i with probability 0.1.\nWe choose 10 5 random codewords (with repetition) from each code to transmit through the simulated PLC channel. At the receiver, we decode detector output v to codeword u . The number of symbols in error is then d(u , u) and the symbol error rate is the ratio of the total number of symbols in error to the total number of symbols transmitted. For uncoded communication, 10 5 random codewords were chosen from Σ n and errors introduced. Here, no decoding is performed and the number of symbols in error is given by |{i : v i = {u i }|.\nThe results of the simulation are displayed in Fig. 1. Equitable symbol weight codes C ESW and D ESW achieve lower symbol error rates compared to the minimum symbol weight codes C SW and D SW , respectively.\nWe have introduced a new code parameter that captures the error-correcting capability of a code with respect to nar- rowband noise and signal fading. Equitable symbol weight codes are shown to be optimal with respect to this parameter when code length, alphabet size and distance are ﬁxed. We also provide simulations that show equitable symbol weight codes to achieve lower symbol error rates as compared to their non-equitable counterparts. These results motivate the study of equitable symbol weight codes as a viable option to handle narrowband noise and signal fading in a PLC channel.\nWe have also constructed inﬁnite classes of optimal equi- table symbol weight codes. This will appear in the full paper.\nResearch of the authors is supported in part by the Singapore National Research Foundation under Research Grant NRF- CRP2-2007-03. C.
