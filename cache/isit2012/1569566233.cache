Based on a) or b) the operational deﬁnition of sequential and non-anticipative rate distortion function is given by expression\nThe complete investigation of existence, characterization, and properties of the above extremum problems requires ex- tensive analysis of the functional I X n →Y n (·, ·) as deﬁned in (3). This is analogous to capacity of channels without feedback which involves maximization of mutual information I(X n ; Y n ) over the power constraint set, and to classical rate distortion function which involves minimization of mutual information I(X n ; Y n ) over the ﬁdelity constraint. However, mutual information I(X n ; Y n ) ≡ I X n ;Y n (P X n , P Y n |X n ), in- herits from its information divergence deﬁnition I(X n ; Y n ) = D(P X n ,Y n ||P X n × P Y n ), several important functional proper- ties such as convexity, concavity, lower semicontinuity, etc. These properties are vital both for ﬁnite alphabet spaces, as well as abstract alphabet spaces [11], [12]. The difﬁ- culty associated with directed information I(X n → Y n ), rises from the fact that this information measure (1)-(3) is a functional I X n →Y n (·, ·) of the collection of conditional distributions {P X i |X i−1 ,Y i−1 (·|·, ·) : i = 0, 1, . . . , n} and {P Y i |Y i−1 ,X i (·|·, ·) : i = 0, 1, . . . , n}.\nThe objective of this paper is to address the following ques- tions, when X 0,n and Y 0,n are complete separable metric spaces (Polish spaces).\n1. Is there an equivalent directed information deﬁnition ex- pressed via information divergence D(·||·) as a functional of two appropriate conditional distributions P(·|y) on\nX N = × ∞ i=0 X i for y = (y 0 , y 1 , . . .) ∈ Y N = × ∞ i=0 Y i and Q(·|x) on Y N for x ∈ X N which uniquely deﬁne {P X i |X i−1 ,Y i−1 : i = 0, 1, . . .} and {P Y i |Y i−1 ,X i : i = 0, 1, . . .}, respectively, and vice-versa?\n2. Is directed information convex and concave functional with respect to the conditional distributions P(·|y) and Q(·|x)?\n3. Is directed information a lower semicontinuous functional of the conditional distributions P(·|y) and Q(·|x)?\n4. What are appropriate conditions for existence of the max- imizing encoder admissible distributions and minimizing distortion admissible distributions?\nThis paper answers the above questions by invoking the topology of weak convergence of probability measures on Polish spaces and Prohorov\u2019s theorems.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II provides the construction of two equivalent deﬁnitions of causal channels on abstract spaces while in Section III the main properties of directed information are given. Finally, in Section IV the extremum problems (4), (5) are discussed. The derivations of theorems are outlined since they are quite lengthy.\nIn this section, the aim is to establish two equivalent deﬁ- nitions of conditional distributions or basic processes, which deﬁne any probabilistic channel with causal feedback, that relates causally the input-output behavior of any channel. This formulation is necessary to investigate questions 1.\u20134.\nLet N = {0, 1, 2, . . .}, and N n = {0, 1, 2, . . . , n}. Intro- duce two sequence of spaces {(X n , B(X n )) : n ∈ N} and {(Y n , B(Y n )) : n ∈ N}, where X n , Y n , n ∈ N are topological spaces, and B(X n ) and B(Y n ) are Borel σ−algebras of subsets of X n and Y n , respectively. Points in X N = × n∈N X n , Y N = × n∈N Y n are denoted by x = {x 0 , x 1 , . . .} ∈ X N , y = {y 0 , y 1 , . . .} ∈ Y N , respectively, while their restrictions to ﬁnite coordinates by x n = {x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x n } ∈ X 0,n , y n = {y 0 , y 1 , . . . , y n } ∈ Y 0,n , for n ∈ N.\nLet B(X N ) = i∈N B(X i ) denote the σ−algebra on X N generated by cylinder sets {x = (x 0 , x 1 , . . .) ∈ X N : x 0 ∈ A 0 , x 1 ∈ A 1 , . . . , x n ∈ A n }, A i ∈ B(X i ), 0 ≤ i ≤ n, n ≥ 1, and similarly for B(Y N ) = i∈N B(Y i ). Hence, B(X 0,n ) and B(Y 0,n ) denote the σ−algebras of cylinder sets in X N and Y N , respectively, with bases over A i ∈ B(X i ), and B i ∈ B(Y i ), 0 ≤ i ≤ n, respectively.\nBackward or Feedback Channel. Suppose for each n ∈ N, the distributions {p n (dx n |x n−1 , y n−1 ) : n ∈ N} with p 0 (dx 0 |x −1 , y −1 ) = p 0 (x 0 ) satisfy the following conditions.\ni) For n ∈ N, p n (·|x n−1 , y n−1 ) is a probability measure on B(X n );\nGiven the collection {p n (dx n |x n−1 , y n−1 ) : n ∈ N} satisfying conditions i), ii), one can construct a family of distributions\nLet C ∈ B(X 0,n ) be a cylinder set of the form C = x ∈ X N : x 0 ∈ C 0 , x 1 ∈ C 1 , . . . , x n ∈ C n , C i ∈ B(X i ), 0 ≤ i ≤ n. Deﬁne a family of measures P(·|y) on B(X N ) by\nn−1 ) is used to denote the restriction of the measure P(·|y) on cylinder sets C ∈ B(X 0,n ), for n ∈ N. Thus, if conditions i) and ii) hold then for each y ∈ Y N , the right hand side of (6) deﬁnes a consistent family of ﬁnite-dimensional distribution on (X N , B(X N )), and hence there exists a unique measure on (X N , B(X N )), from which p n (dx n |x n−1 , y n−1 ) is obtained. This leads to the ﬁrst, usual deﬁnition of a feedback channel, as a family of functions p n (dx n |x n−1 , y n−1 ) satisfying conditions i) and ii).\nAn alternative, equivalent deﬁnition of a feedback channel is established as follows. Introduce the assumption\niii) {X n : n ∈ N} are complete separable metric spaces (Polish Spaces) and {B(X n ) : n ∈ N} are the σ−algebras of Borel sets.\nConsider a family of measures P(·|y) on (X N , B(X N )) satis- fying the following consistency condition.\nC1: If E ∈ B(X 0,n ), then P(E|y) is B(Y 0,n−1 )−measurable function of y ∈ Y N .\nThen, by assumption iii), for any family of measures P(·|y) satisfying C1 one can construct a collection of versions of conditional distributions {p n (dx n |x n−1 , y n−1 ) : n ∈ N} satisfying conditions i) and ii) which are connected with P(·|y) via relation (6).\nTherefore, for Polish Spaces {X n : n ∈ N} the second equivalent deﬁnition is given by a family of measures P(·|y) on (X N , B(X N )) depending parametrically on y ∈ Y N and satisfying the consistency condition C1.\nThe point to be made here is that the second equivalent deﬁ- nition of a feedback channel, together with similar deﬁnition for the forward channel is convenient to deﬁne directed infor- mation via relative entropy, similar to the mutual information deﬁnition, and extend well-known functional properties of mutual information to directed information.\nForward Channel. The previous methodology is repeated for the collection of functions {q n (dy n |y n−1 , x n ) : n ∈ N} which satisfy the following conditions.\niv) For n ∈ N, q n (·|y n−1 , x n ) is a probability measure on B(Y n );\nSimilarly as before, there exists a unique measure on (Y N , B(Y N )) for which the family of distributions {q n (dy n |y n−1 , x n ) : n ∈ N} is obtained. Introduced the assumption\nvi) {Y n : n ∈ N} are Polish Spaces and {B(Y n ) : n ∈ N} are the σ−algebras of Borel sets.\nConsider a family of measures Q(D|x) satisfying the following consistency condition.\nC2: If F ∈ B(Y 0,n ), then Q(F |x) is B(X 0,n )−measurable function of x ∈ X N .\nThen, by assumption vi), for any family of measures Q(·|x) on (Y N , B(Y N )) satisfying consistency condition C2 one can construct a collection of functions {q n (dy n |y n−1 , x n ) : n ∈ N} satisfying conditions iv) and v) which are connected with Q(·|x) via relation (8). Note that Kolmogorov\u2019s extension theorem guarantees the construction of countable additive probability measures for both P(·|y) and Q(·|x).\nGiven the basic measures P(·|y) on X N and Q(·|x) on Y N satisfying consistency condition C1 and C2, respectively, construct the collections of conditional distributions as follows.\nLet A (n) = {x : x n ∈A}, A ∈ B(X n ) and B (n) = {y : y n ∈B}, B ∈ B(Y n ). In addition, let P(A (n) |y|B(X 0,n−1 )) denote the conditional probability of A (n) with respect to B(X 0,n−1 ) calculated on the probability space X N , B(X N ), P(·|y) , and similarly for Q(B (n) |x|B(Y 0,n−1 )). Then\nNote that p n (·; ·, ·) ∈ Q(X n ; X 0,n−1 ×Y 0,n−1 ) and q n (·; ·, ·) ∈ Q(Y n ; Y 0,n−1 × X 0,n ) are stochastic kernels [13], determined from P(·|·) and Q(·|·), respectively, (e.g., related via (6), (8)). The distribution of RV\u2019s {(X i , Y i ) : i ∈ N} is deﬁned by\nHence, for any P(·|·) and Q(·|·) satisfying consistency con- ditions there exist a probability space and a sequence of RV\u2019s {(X i , Y i ) : i ∈ N} deﬁned on it, whose joint probability distribution is deﬁned uniquely via P(·|·) and Q(·|·).\nIn this section, directed information I(X n → Y n ) will be deﬁned via relative entropy, using the basic measures P(·|y)\nGiven conditional distributions P(·|·) ∈ Q C1 (X N ; Y N ) and Q(·|·) ∈ Q C2 (Y N ; X N ) deﬁne the following measures.\nP3: The marginal distributions on Y N deﬁned uniquely for B i ∈ B(Y i ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n by\nP4: The measure − → Π 0,n : B(X 0,n ) B(Y 0,n ) → [0, 1] deﬁned uniquely for A i ∈ B(X i ), B i ∈ B(Y i ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n by\nP5: The measure ← − Π 0,n : B(Y 0,n ) B(X 0,n ) → [0, 1] deﬁned uniquely for A i ∈ B(X i ), B i ∈ B(Y i ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n by\nBy invoking the deﬁnition of directed information (1) or (2), it can be shown that\nThe right hand side of (11) follows from repeated application of chain rule of relative entropy [13], while (12) follows from the fact that\n⊗ − → Q 0,n << ← − P 0,n ⊗ ν 0,n if and only if\n0,n ⊗ ν 0,n then the Radon- Nikodym derivative (\nLet Q C1 (X 0,n ; Y 0,n−1 ), Q C2 (Y 0,n ; X 0,n ) be the restrictions of Q C1 (X N ; Y N ) and Q C2 (Y N ; X N ), respectively, to cylin- der sets with bases over A i ∈ B(X i ), and B i ∈ B(Y i ), i = 0, 1, . . . , n.
