The baseband equivalent model is\nr(t) = s(t) + w(t) =\nwhere w(t) is the white Gaussian noise, x[n] is a sequence of independent and uniformly distributed symbols drawn from a complex-valued alphabet X with size |X |, g(t) is a ﬁnite- energy modulation pulse, typically real and continuous. More- over, g(t) is assumed to be time-limited and approximately band-limited. Time-limited means g(t) vanishes outside a ﬁnite number of symbol intervals, say [0, LT s ]. Approximately band-limited means the energy outside a ﬁnite frequency interval is lower than a predeﬁned threshold ε, which is negligibly small. We consider only baseband equivalent model, so assume that the frequency interval is B = [−B/2, B/2], i.e. the bandwidth of g(t) is B. Then the power spectrum density (PSD) of s(t) is\nwhere E s is the symbol energy, |G(f)| 2 is the PSD of g(t) normalized as\nB |G(f)| 2 df = T s . So the PSD of s(t) is determined by g(t) and the bandwidth of s(t) is also B.\nIn most cases Nyquist signaling (NS) is used in (1), i.e. choose g(t) to be a \u201cT-orthogonal\u201d pulse g N (t) such as sinc pulse and root raise cosine (RRC) pulses whose T s -sampled autocorrelation function\nsatisﬁes h[k] = δ[k]. Then if we set T s = T N and use a match ﬁlter receiver, intersymbol interference (ISI) free transmission\nis achieved. But in this case the symbol rate 1/T s is upper bounded by the so-called Nyquist rate, which is equal to B (note that we consider complex symbol here). Moreover, the Nyquist rate can only be achieved when the unpractical sinc pulse is employed. This means for NS the only way to improve the spectral efﬁciency is to use larger symbol alphabets.\nAn alternative way for bandwidth efﬁcient modulation is faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling, which was introduced in 1970\u2019s [1]. The original idea of FTN is to reduce T s from T N to τ T N , τ < 1, i.e. increasing the symbol rate to get a higher information rate, and keep the performance degradation acceptable. Although ISI is unavoidable in FTN, symbols can be detected via sequence detection [2] or equalization. It has been shown that for typical T-orthogonal pulses the minimum Euclidean distance d min of FTN signals is not reduced until τ is less than a threshold τ M < 1, e.g. τ M = 0.802 for sinc pulse [1]. τ M is called Mazo Limit, which is a classic parameter in FTN research since the probability of error of uncoded transmission is dominated by d min in high-SNR regime. However, for a long time FTN didn\u2019t attract much attention, even some negative opinion was reported [3]. This is partially because its detection complexity, but a perhaps more important reason is that there was a lack of motivation to replace NS by this more complex technique, especially when we can approach AWGN channel capacity within a few tenths of a decibel by capacity-achieving codes. In recent years, Rusek and Anderson [4] showed that FTN often has capacity gains relative to NS because it can utilize the excess bandwidth from any practical pulse shaping but NS can not. So NS is in fact suboptimal. The capacity of FTN, however, is the same as the waveform channel capacity if it \u201cfast\u201d enough. Their researches give FTN an undoubted value.\nIn FTN researches, however, the design of the modulation pulse was rarely considered. Moreover, only T-orthogonal pulses were employed. When ISI is unavoidable, the pulse can be seen as a channel code. A carefully designed pulse is beneﬁcial to performance and detection complexity. The T- orthogonal assumption, whose original motivation is only to avoid ISI in NS, is a completely unnecessary constraint for pulse design and is irrelevant to the capacity gain of FTN. So a generalized version of FTN with pulse design as its important research topic is needed, and this is the motivation of our work.\nIn this paper we discard the T-orthogonal assumption and consider the problem of faster-than-Nyquist signaling with ar-\nbitrary pulses, called generalized faster-than-Nyquist (GFTN) signaling whose model is given in Section II-A based on a universal deﬁnition of nominal bandwidth. Then we focus on the detection complexity and capacity gain of GFTN given in section II-B and III respectively. Section III also gives results of the capacity asymptotic behaviors of some GFTN examples with comparison to NS. In Section IV we discuss the design of GFTN with emphasis on pulse design. The conclusion is given in the last section.\nWhen we consider a generalized version of FTN which employs arbitrary pulses, a benchmark is needed to measure the relative signaling rate to NS, like the function of T N for FTN. But we can hardly ﬁnd it for non-T-orthogonal pulses in time domain. We know that for NS the nominal bandwidth is deﬁned to be the complex symbol rate W = 1/T N . So the function of W is the same as T N for FTN. We generally deﬁne the nominal bandwidth for linear digital modulation signals with modulation pulse g(t) as\n−B/2 |G(f)| 2 df max\nThe nominal bandwidth deﬁnition of NS is a special case of ours, which can be veriﬁed according to the PSD band-edge symmetry of T-orthogonal pulses with roll off 0 < α ≤ 1, i.e.\n(6) is a basic corollary of Nyquist criterion. Note that practical Nyquist systems usually use pulses with α < 0.3 .\nNow we can give the model of generalized faster-than- Nyquist signaling as\nwhere the symbol interval T s equals τ /W . GFTN includes any linear digital modulation signals with a symbol rate larger than its nominal bandwidth. Evidently, FTN is a special case. Moreover, partial response signaling (PRS) which maybe the only well-known non-Nyquist systems are also special cases.\nIn the model (7) g(t) can be arbitrary pulses as we described at the beginning of this section. But in the rest of the paper only roll off pulses will be considered which satisfy |G(f)| = |G(0)| = max\nreason will be given in section III. Thus our deﬁnition of nominal bandwidth is the same as the deﬁnition of equivalent noise bandwidth of ﬁlters:\nwhere P N is the power of the noise component that projected onto the signal vector s(t) in Euclidean signal space, i.e. the part of noise that really affect the performance. This is another property of our nominal bandwidth deﬁnition.\nSince the model of GFTN is available, now the problem of d min computation can also be considered like traditional FTN research, but the difference is the Mazo limit phenomena may not exist in some cases. More study is not involved here as the computation method has been well established in the literature, e.g. [5]. Even if d min holds, the distance distribution will always change when τ is reduced. So GFTN can be seen as a channel code with a coding gain (although it is in fact negative according to match ﬁlter bound [1]) or inner code for coded input sequences. We deﬁne its code rate as r G = 1/τ . If we have a bit rate R over B the spectral efﬁciency is thus η = R/B. Typically R = r/T s = r bin ·log 2 |X |/T s , where r is the average number of information bits carried by a symbol, r bin is the rate of binary-coding. For a GFTN system, the overall code rate is r · r G , we call it nominal spectral efﬁciency, denoted as η nom . Thus η nom = r/W T s = R/W . We deﬁne bandwidth excess as β = (B − W )/W . For T-orthogonal pulses the roll off α equals to β , but for arbitrary pulses their relationship is uncertain. Then η = η nom /(1+β) . So η is proportional to r G , i.e. inversely proportional to τ , and β introduces some spectral efﬁciency penalty. When β → 0, η → η nom . In summary,\nThe optimal sequence detector of linear digital modulation signals with ISI (includes GFTN as a special case) is given in [2]. Here we introduce it brieﬂy to analyze the factors affect detection complexity.\nFirst, from the T s -spaced sampling of the output of a match ﬁlter g(LT s − t) for r(t), a set of sufﬁcient statistics to detect x[n] is obtained which denoted as a sequence y[n] called Ungerboeck observation, given by\n−∞ w(t)g(t − nT s )dt, h[k] has been deﬁned in section I. Then a information-lossless whiten ﬁlter can be used to y[n] to get the Forney observation model\nwhere b[n] is a causal ISI tap sequence satisﬁes that its autocorrelation is h[k].\n(11) is evidently a convolution model. It\u2019s well known that it can be solved by maximal likelihood sequence detection with Viterbi algorithm. Recall that the time duration of g(t) is LT s , we have h[k] = 0, |k| ≥ L. Moreover, h[k] ̸= 0, |k| < L is always true for pulses not carefully designed. So the number\nof the non-zero ISI taps is L − 1, which is deﬁned as the ISI memory length denoted by ν. Thus the trellis diagram of the ISI convolution model has |X | ν states with |X | branches each. So the trellis complexity of the optimal detection of GFTN is\nRusek and Anderson analyze the capacity of FTN and the effects of input constraints as well as signaling rate [4,6]. Their methods hold for GFTN. So in this subsection we only cover the main results brieﬂy.\nFor an ideal band-limited AWGN channel, i.e. the frequency domain channel response is a rectangular (or brick-wall) spectrum, the ultimate channel capacity is\nBut for a non-ideal signal with normalized PSD |G norm (f ) | 2 , i.e.\nB |G norm (f ) | 2 df = 1, its maximum signaling rate is upper bounded by the capacity of waveform channel\nNext we omit the superscript and denote G norm (f ) brieﬂy as G(f ). The G(f ) that maximize C w (G(f )) and makes it equal to C in (13) is just the non-practical rectangular spectrum (sinc pulse in time domain) according to water-ﬁlling theorem. The capacity of NS with bandwidth excess β is\nIt\u2019s independent of g N (t) used. C N (β) < C w (G N (f )) is always true except when g N (t) is sinc pulse. So C w (G N (f )) can be seen as the \u201cpractical\u201d capacity and NS is always suboptimal.\nNow we consider the capacity of a linear digital modulation system, denoted as C LM , where GFTN is a special case. C LM can be obtained from the capacity of its equivalent discrete time model (e.g. its Forney observation model) denoted as C DT by C LM = C DT /T s . C DT is [7]\nb[k]e −jλk is the discrete time Fourier transform of b[k]. So for given T s , the relationship between B(λ) and G(f ) is\nThen the capacity of GFTN denote as C G can be obtained easily for given τ .\nAn important corollary of (18) is that when r G ≥ 1 + β we have C G = C w > C N with the same PSD and power constraints [4]. Thus all possible capacity gain is obtained. Note that r G ≥ 1 + β implies T s ≤ 1/B, so this corollary tells us when the sampling rate of receiver (i.e. the symbol rate of GFTN) exceed the Nyquist sampling rate of g(t) the capacity of the waveform channel can be fully utilized. But higher r G doesn\u2019t increase capacity.\nIn fact, even r G is lower than 1 + β, in most cases C G is still larger than C N , and C G often increases monotonically with r G [6]. However, since 1+β is typically at most only 1.3, it\u2019s reasonable to set r G ≥ 1 + β. We assume this condition holds in the rest of the paper.\nIn this subsection the capacity gains of GFTN are analyzed. All proofs are omitted because of the limited space.\nLemma 1: For two arbitrary waveform channels i = 1, 2 deﬁned on frequency intervals B i with normalized PSDs |G i (f ) | 2 and equal transmit powers\nµ( B + 1 ) µ( B + 2 )\nwhere B + i = {f : |G i (f ) | 2 > 0 } and µ(B + i ) is its Lebesgue measure.\nTheorem 1: Deﬁne the capacity gain of GFTN as (C G − C N )/C N , Then the asymptotic capacity gain of GFTN relative to NS with the same bandwidth and power constraints is β when P → ∞ or 0 when P → 0.\nCorollary 1: For the same bandwidth and power constraints, the capacity of GFTN can approach the capacity of an ideal band-limited AWGN channel asymptotically, i.e. GFTN is asymptotic optimal.\nWe point that [4] had given a theorem which is essentially the same as corollary 1.\nTheorem 2 (the limit of the capacity gain of GFTN): The asymptotic relative capacity gain of GFTN relative to NS with the same PSD and power constraints satisﬁes 0 < µ < β for any SNR.\nAll above results can be interpreted as the view of capacity spectrum density (CSD) C(f ) = log(1+P |G(f)| 2 /N 0 ). Since log(1 + x) → x, when x → 0, in low SNR regime the channel is power-limited, the shape of CSD approaches the shape of PSD. Since log(1 + ax)/ log(1 + bx) → 1 when x → ∞, in high SNR regime the channel is bandwidth limited, the shape of CSD approaches shape of rectangular, and thus the capacity differences from different pulses asymptotically disappear. Now we can interpret why we consider only roll off pulses in GFTN research: a PSD near rectangular spectrum is better, and a small α is preferred.\nTheorem 3 (the absolute asymptotic capacity loss of GFTN): When P → ∞ the capacity loss of GFTN to ideal AWGN channel approaches a constant −\nB log B |G(f)| 2 df . Corollary 1 can also be derived from this theorem.\nNow we give some examples about the asymptotic behaviors of GFTN and NS with given PSDs, since a general analysis on arbitrary PSDs is difﬁcult and unnecessary. For NS we use classic RC PSDs with α = 0.1 and α = 0.3. For GFTN the PSDs comes from cos n (f ) windows. When n = 1\n(π/2) cos(πf /B) |f| ≤ B/2 0 \t |f| > B/2\n2 cos 2 (πf /B) |f| ≤ B/2 0 \t |f| > B/2\nIts nominal bandwidth is 0.5B. It\u2019s often called Hann. window, which is in fact a RC pulse with α = 1. At last the ideal band- limited AWGN channel with rectangular PSD is included as a benchmark. All PSD examples are shown in Fig. 1. We see that the PSDs of GFTN examples are not only far from ideal rectangular PSD, but even worse than NS examples.\nThe capacity computation results are given in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 for relatively low and high SNR regime respectively. We note that the SNR in the ﬁgures mean P/N 0 B, not P/N 0 W ENB .\nIt is shown that in relatively low SNR regime, the capacities of GFTN increase faster than NS\u2019s. Although the PSDs of GFTN are worse than NS\u2019s, moderate to high gains are\nobtained in high SNR regime, especially power gains. For example, at η = 8 bit/s/Hz, the power gain of the ﬁrst GFTN example to NS example with α = 0.3 is as large as 10 dB! In fact, the power gains as well as capacity gains are unbounded.\nFig. 4 shows the interesting asymptotic behaviors of nor- malized capacities, where all capacities are normalized to the capacity of ideal band-limited AWGN channel. Many results mentioned above are clearer in this style. Moreover, we found that for each GFTN example there exists a certain SNR in low SNR regime correspond to a lowest normalized capacity.\nUnlike traditional FTN researches, this paper emphasizes the idea that to optimize GFTN system via pulse design. It\u2019s not only very important to reduce the detection complexity, but also helpful to achieve the waveform channel capacity.\nFrom (12), the detection complexity ψ of GFTN is de- termined by |X | and ν. For a certain η as a design target we can adjust |X | and r G (to adjust ν) to minimize ψ. The logarithm of |X | is proportional to η. ν is determined by the actual length of g(t), say T g , and the symbol interval T s , i.e. ν = L − 1 = ⌈T g /T s ⌉ − 1 where ⌈a⌉ is the minimum integer larger than a. Recall that T s = 1/W r G and η ∝ r G , so ν is roughly proportional to η for given T g or proportional to T g for given η. A linear increase of either T g or η will cause an exponentially increase of ψ. So |X | ν is roughly ﬁxed for\ngiven η and T g . Then from (12), a smaller |X | (which causes larger ν or r G for given η) may leads to smaller complexity.\nFor further complexity reduction, a natural idea is to design pulses with smaller T g for ﬁxed B. We deﬁne the actual time bandwidth product (TBP) of pulse as γ = T g B. The lowest complexity can be obtained by ﬁnd a pulse with smallest γ subject to a energy leakage ε in frequency domain, since γ cannot be arbitrary small according to the uncertainty principle. Slepian, Landau and Pollak introduced the method to generate such pulses from prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF) [8,9]. Note that the classic TBP deﬁnition is based on root mean square bandwidth and duration but not the same as ours, so the smallest classic TBP pulse, Gaussian waveform, is not the best solution of our problem. From [9], a pulse generated by PSWF with γ from 2 to 3 is sufﬁcient to make ε small enough. For example, set β = 1, r G = 2, i.e. 1/T s = B, then ν = 2 can be obtained. This can hardly be obtained in FTN systems employing RRC pulses. A larger η may cause larger ν, but it\u2019s still the smallest possible value. Moreover, in practice some suboptimal algorithms such as the truncated Viterbi algorithm can be used for the tradeoff between performance and complexity.\nAnother idea for complexity reduction is to ﬁnd g(t) satis- ﬁes\nvia carefully pulse design, where ν e can be called effective ISI memory length. The actual complexity is then\na ν e strictly less than ν reduces complexity. For example, we can choose the so-called duobinary pulse used in traditional PRS systems as g(t), which satisﬁes\n    \n1/2 |k| = 1 0 \t |k| > 1\nfor 1/T s = B, i.e. r G = 1 + β. Although γ is not considered, ν e = 1 is obtained. This may better than when PSWF-style pulse is used. This kind of GFTN can be seen as a PRS system but with different design philosophy. However, PRS- style pulses achieve ν e < ν only for r G = 1 + β. A slightly larger r G can be achieved with some approximations, e.g. [10].\nA more complete and accurate view of GFTN pulse design is to treat the pulse as a rate-1 convolutional inner code and design turbo-like concatenated coding schemes. The code design is a more complex topic and we don\u2019t discuss it in depth here. Typically, when a carefully designed rate-1 precoder without spectrum broadening is introduced in the turbo-like coding scheme, the waveform channel capacity can be approached, usually with acceptable detection complexity [11]. Then the target of the pulse design is no longer only complexity reduction, and techniques from modern coding theory are emphasized. A design example based on FTN with η norm = 2bit/s/Hz operates below the Shannon limit of NS with the same PSD had been given in [12]. Truncated Viterbi\nalgorithm is used to reduce the detection complexity of FTN. But this example is still not very practical (encode block length 10000 symbols, 35 iterations, some error ﬂoor). Using techniques introduced in this section, more practical schemes based on GFTN are expected to achieve.\nAt last we point that for all above pulse design guidelines the shape of its PSD should be considered as a constraint. It affects the capacity penalty relative to ideal band-limited AWGN channel. Thanks to the capacity asymptotic behavior, higher SNR leads to smaller penalty and gives pulse design more freedom. So the PSD is in fact a \u201csoft constraint\u201d.\nIn this paper, we introduce generalized faster-than-Nyquist signaling to utilize the capacity of excess bandwidth, which maybe the ﬁnal potential of typical point-to-point channels. Our extension from FTN to GFTN gives more freedom to the design of pulses for good performance and acceptable detection complexity. GFTN is especially valuable in high SNR regime where we can do more freely pulse design with little capacity cost and considerable power gains can still be obtained. GFTN with carefully designed concatenation coding and iterative decoding can be a valuable bandwidth efﬁcient transmission technique in future."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"J. E.
