"},"body":{"text":"Consider  a  distributive  communication  system  in  which  multiple  transmitters  located  at  different  places  cooperatively  send  common  messages  to  a  single  receiver.  This  scenario  arises, e.g., in the following two applications. \n\u2022   In  a  cooperative  cellular  system,  several  adjacent  base  stations  (BSs)  simultaneously  serve  a  mobile  terminal  (MT) in  the downlink  transmission [1].  Such a  scheme  is  referred  to  as  coordinated  multi-point  (CoMP)  [2]-[4]  in  long term evolution (LTE) standardization documents [5].  \n\u2022   In  a  parallel  relaying  system,  multiple  relays  decode  and  forward  (DF)  messages  from  a  common  source  to  a  common destination [6]-[8].  \nIntensive  work  has  been  focused  on  this  scenario  under  various  assumptions  on  the  availability  of  channel  state  information  at  the  transmitters  (CSIT).  In  [7]-[8]  no  CSIT  is  assumed  and  distributed  space-time  coding  is  proposed  for  efficient  transmission.  In  [1]-[5]  full  CSIT  is  assumed,  i.e.,  every  transmitter  perfectly  knows  all  the  channel  state  information (CSI). With full CSIT, beamforming is performed  jointly  among  the  transmitters  to  enhance  the  system  performance significantly.  \nHowever, in practice, it is very costly to acquire full CSI at  all transmitters. This problem is especially serious in multiple-\ninput  multiple-output  (MIMO)  systems  in  which  multiple  antennas  are  employed  in  transmission.  The  resulting  overall  system may have a very large dimension. Distributing all these  coefficients to all transmitters can be a daunting task. \nIn this paper, we study the situation of individual CSIT (I- CSIT),  in  which  each  transmitter  has  the  CSI  of  its  own  link  but  not  other\u2019s.  This  setting  can  significantly  decrease  the  overhead for distributing CSI among transmitters. We develop  a  Hermitian  precoding  technique  for  efficient  transmission \nwith I-CSIT. We show analytically that the proposed precoding  technique  is  optimal  in  the  sense  of  the  rate  maximization  under  the  I-CSIT  assumption,  provided  that  the  other  transmitters are a priori fixed to the same precoding structure.  Numerical  results  demonstrate  that  the  proposed  scheme  with  I-CSIT performs close to the system capacity with full CSIT. \nWe  describe  the  system  model  for  the  distributed  MIMO  system,  in  which  K  transmitters  send  common  messages  to  a  single  receiver.  Each  transmitter  k,  k  =  1,  \u2026,  K,  is  equipped  with N antennas and the receiver is equipped with M antennas.  The received signal at the receiver can be expressed as \nwhere r is an M-by-1 received signal vector, H k  is an M-by-N  channel  transfer  matrix  for  the  link  between  the  transmitter  k  and  the  receiver,  x k   is  an  N-by-1  signal  vector  sent  by  the  transmitter k, and n ~ CN(0, σ 2 I) is an additive white Gaussian  noise  vector.  Moreover,  each  transmitter  k  has  an  individual  power constraint of  \nwhere P k  is the maximum transmission power of transmitter k,  ||·|| 2   stands  for  the  Euclidean  norm  of  a  vector.  Perfect  CSI  at  the receiver is always assumed, i.e., the receiver knows all H k  .  \nDefinition  1 :  A  random  square  matrix  U  is  called  a  Haar  matrix if it is uniformly distributed on the set of all the unitary  matrices (of the same size as U) [9] 1 . \nProperty 1 : [p.25, 9] A Haar matrix U is unitarily invariant,  i.e.,  for  any  fixed  unitary  matrix  T  independent  of  U,  the  statistical behavior of TU or UT is the same as U.  \nProperty  2 : [p.25, 9]  Consider a random  Hermitian  matrix  B  given  by  B  =  UΛU H ,  with  U  being  a  Haar  matrix  and  Λ  being  a  random  diagonal  matrix.  Assume  that  U  and  Λ  are  independent  of  each  other.  Then  B  is  unitarily  invariant,  i.e.,  for any unitary matrix T independent of B, TBT H  has the same  distribution as B. Also, B *  has the same distribution as B.  \nNow  we  describe  some  useful  properties  of  {H k }.  Throughout  this  paper,  the  entries  of  H k ,  k  =  1,  \u2026,  K,  are  assumed to be i.i.d. random variables drawn from CN(0,  σ k 2 ). 2   Let the singular value decomposition (SVD) of H k  be \nwhere  U k   and  V k   are  unitary  matrices,  and  D k   is  an  M-by-N  diagonal matrix 3  with non-negative diagonal elements arranged  in the descending order. Then \nProperty 3 : The matrices U k  and D k  are independent.  Property 4 : U k  is a Haar matrix [9] [11]. \nBased  on  Property  4,  the  properties  of  Haar  matrix  in  Subsection B hold for U k . \nIn this section, we consider the situation of I-CSIT in which  each transmitter k only knows its own channel H k . \nRecall that all the transmitters share the same message to be  sent  to  a  single  receiver.  Yet,  the  transmitters  still  have  the  freedom  to  use  the  same  codebook  or  different  codebooks  in  channel  coding.  Hence  the  transmitted  signals  {x k }  may  be  either  correlated  or  uncorrelated.  We  use  c 0   to  represent  the  correlated signal component shared by all the transmitters, and  c k   to  represent  the  uncorrelated  signal  component  for  transmitter  k  (for  k  =  1,  \u2026,  K),  where  \t 0 { } K k k = c \t  are  M-by-1  random  vectors  with  the  entries  independently  drawn  from  CN(0, 1). By definition, E[c k c k H ] = I and E[c k c j H ] = 0,  ∀k, j = 0,  1, \u2026, K, k ≠ j. Then, the transmitted signal of transmitter k can  be expressed as \n                         \t 0 k \t k \t k k = \t + x F c G c ,    k = 1, \u2026, K,              (4)  where  F k   and  G k   are  N-by-M  precoding  matrices  that  is  adaptive to the channel. With (4), we rewrite (1) as  \nThe  distributive  precoding  functions  {f k (·)}  and  {g k (·)}  should  be  optimized  to  maximize  the  average  achievable  rate  of  the  system  in  (5)  under  the  individual  transmitter  power  constraints in (2). This problem can be formulated as \n \t   \t   \t   \t  ∑ \t ∑ I \t H H \t H H\nwhere  |A| 2   is  a  shorthand  of  AA H   for  any  matrix  A,  the  expectation in (7) is taken over the joint distribution of {H k   | k  =  1,  \u2026,  K},  and  the  power  constraint  is  imposed  on  every  possible realization of H k , k = 1, \u2026, K. \nThe  problem  in  (7)  is  difficult  to  handle  in  general  since  jointly  optimizing  {f k (·)}  and  {g k (·)}  is  required.  In  what  follows, we focus on a locally optimal solution defined below. \nDefinition  2 :  A  set  of  precoding  functions  { \t } 1 ( ), ( ) K k \t k k f \t g \t = ⋅ \t ⋅ \t   is locally optimal if,  ∀k = 1, \u2026, K,  { \t } ( ), ( ) k k k k f \t g \t = H \t H \t  \n \t  \t   \t  + \t +     \t   \nwhere the expectation is taken over {H k \u2032  | k\u2032 = 1, \u2026, K, k\u2032 ≠ k }.  In  other  words,  any  particular  transmitter  k  deviating  from  its  own precoding strategy leads to performance degradation.  \nRecall the SVD of H k  in (3) as H k  = U k D k V k H . As U k  and V k   are  unitary,  the  precoders  in  (6)  can  always  be  written  in  the  following form: for any k = 1, \u2026, K, \nf = \t = F \t H V W U  and  \t H ( ) k \t k \t k k k g = \t = G \t H V Σ U ,   (9)  where W k  and Σ k  can be arbitrary N-by-M matrices except that  they  only  depend  on  H k   (due  to  the  I-CSIT  assumption).  We  have the following result with the proof given in Appendix. \nTheorem 1: The optimal {F k } and {G k } to (8) are given by  (9) with {W k } and {Σ k Σ k H } being real and diagonal matrices.  \nTheorem 1 gives the optimal structure of the precoders for  the problem defined in (8).   \nWith Theorem 1, we still need to optimize {W k } and {Σ k }  for  power  allocation  based  on  available  CSI.  Due  to  space  limitation, we only consider a simple choice of W k  and Σ k  as \n                           W k  = k P M I  and Σ k  = 0.                  (10)  More  advanced  power  allocation  strategies  are  discussed  in  [12]. The reason for Σ k  = 0 is intuitively explained as follows. \nConsider  the  multiple-input  single-output  (MISO)  case  (i.e., N ≥ M =1). The channels {H k } reduce to vectors {h k } and  allow  the  expression  of  \t H 2 k \t k k = h h v ,  where  \t H \t 2 k k k = v h h ,  for  k  =  1,  \u2026,  K.  Then,  it  is  easy  to  see  that  the  optimal  precoding strategy to the problem in (7) is given by  \nwhere r, c 0 , and n are respectively the scalar versions of r, c 0 ,  and  n.  In  (12),  we  see  that  the  signals  from  different  transmitters are coherently superimposed on each other. Based  on the above observation, it is reasonable to expect that G k  = 0  (or  Σ Σ Σ Σ k  = 0) is also a good choice for the MIMO cases. \nf = \t = F \t H V W U  and  \t ( ) k k k g = \t = G \t H \t 0 .     (13)  With (13), the received signal in (5) can be rewritten as \ndefinite  Hermitian  matrix.  From  Weyl  Theorem  [13],  for  any  positive  semi-definite  matrices  A  and  B,  we  have \n (or  ) \t + A B A B . Hence, our proposed precoding strategy in  (13)  increases  the  eigen-values  of  the  overall  equivalent  channel, which provides an intuitive explanation of the related  gain. This can be seen as the effect of coherent transmission. \nIn  this  section,  numerical  results  are  provided  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  proposed  Hermitian  precoding  technique  in  distributed  MIMO  channels.  Some  alternative  schemes  are  listed  below  for  comparison.  For  simplicity  of  discussion, we always assume N = M.  \n(i)  Hermitian  Precoding  with  Equal  Power  Allocation  (HP- EPA):     \t   \t H k \t k \t k k P M = F \t V U  and G k  = 0.  \n(ii) Hermitian Precoding with Channel Inverse (HP-CI):   \t                                 \t 1 H k \t k k k k β \t − = F \t V D U  and G k  = 0.  \nThis is obtained by  substituting  \t 1 k \t k k β − = W \t D  in (13)  with  β k  a scalar chosen to meet the power constraint.  \n(iii) No CSIT with fully Correlated Signaling (No-CSIT-CS):    \t                F k  =  k P M I  and G k  = 0.  \n(iv)  No CSIT with Independent Signaling (No-CSIT-IS):    \t                F k  = 0 and G k  =  k P M I .  \n  \t   \t k k k = F V W  and G k  = 0.         \t                    Here  V k   is  obtained  from  the  SVD  H k  =  U k D k V k H   and  W k  \n(that  is  diagonal)  is  obtained  by  water-filling  over  D k .  In  other  words,  IWF  applies  standard  water-filling  [14]  at  each individual transmitter. \nNote that the only difference between (i) and (ii) is the choice  of W k . They both have the Hermitian precoding structure. On  the  other  hand,  the  choices  (iii)\u2013(v)  do  not  involve  the  Hermitian  precoding  structure,  and  thus  lack  the  coherent  transmission effect discussed in Section IV.C.  \nFig.1  illustrates  the  performance  of  various  precoding  schemes  with  K  =  3,  N  =  16,  and  M  =  8.  It  is  seen  that  HP-\nEPA  performs  very  close  to  the  upper  bound  obtained  by  assuming  full  CSIT  (as  studied  in  [3]).  This  implies  that  the  potential  performance  loss  due  to  the  I-CSIT  assumption  is  marginal. We also see that HP-EPA significantly outperforms  other alternatives. Note that the performance of No-CSIT-CS, \nNo-CSIT-IS and IWF is relatively poor in Fig. 1. The reason is  that  they  cannot  achieve  the  coherent  effect  provided  by  the  Hermitian precoding structure. \nFig.2  studies  the  impact  of  the  numbers  of  transmitters  on  the  performance  of  Hermitian  precoding.  The  numbers  of  antennas are set to M = 4 and N = 16. The performance curves  with  full-CSIT  and  No-CSIT-IS  are  also  included  for  comparison.  Again,  the  gap  between  the  Hermitian  precoding  scheme  and  the  full-CSIT  capacity  is  very  small.  Compared  with the curve of No-CSIT-IS, the power gain of the proposed  precoder is about 9 dB for K = 2, 12 dB for K = 4, 15 dB for K  = 8, and 17 dB for K = 12. Roughly speaking, this power gain  increases linearly with K. \nIn  this  paper,  we  consider  efficient  transmission  over  distributed  MIMO  channels  with  I-CSIT.  A  Hermitian  precoding technique is proposed to exploit the available CSIT.  We  show  analytically  that  the  proposed  Hermitian  precoding  technique  is  optimal  for  each  transmitter  under  the  I-CSIT \nassumption  when  the  other  transmitters  are  a  priori  fixed  to  the same precoding structure. Numerical results show that the  proposed  Hermitian  precoding  scheme  with  I-CSIT  suffers  marginal performance loss compared with the system with full  CSIT in various settings. This indicates that the amount of CSI  required  at  the  transmitter  sides  can  be  significantly  reduced  without considerably compromising the system performance. \nFor notational simplicity, we only consider the case of K =  2.  The  extension  of  the  proof  to  the  case  of  K  >  2  is  trivial.  Since all transmitters experience the same channel distribution,  these two transmitters are symmetric. Then, the problem in (8)  reduces to  \n(15)  where F 2  = f 2 (H 2 ) = V 2 W 2 U 2 H , and G 2  = g 2 (H 2 ) = V 2 Σ 2 U 2 H . The  expectation  is  taken  over  H 2 .  Due  to  the  local  optimality  defined  in  Section  III.C  that  other  transmitters  are  a  priori  fixed  to  the  desired  structure,  W 2   and  Σ 2 Σ 2 H   here  are  real  diagonal matrices and independent of V 2  and U 2 . Furthermore, \nare Hermitian, and that U 2  is a Haar matrix. From Property 2 in  Section  II.B,  U 1 H H 2 F 2 U 1   and  U 1 H |H 2 G 2 | 2 U 1   have  the  same  distribution  as  H 2 F 2   and  |H 2 G 2 | 2 ,  respectively.  Thus,  with  the  individual  CSI  (i.e.,  H 1   =  U 1 D 1 V 1 H )  of  the  transmitter  1,  we  rewrite the objective function in (15) as \n(16)  where  \t H 1 1 1 1 = W V F U  from (9) and Λ 1  is defined as  \nFrom (16) and (17), the problem in (15) can be rewritten as an  optimization problem for Λ 1  and W 1  as \nwhere  X Y  means that Y−X is positive semi-definite, and  ( ) 1 1 , ϕ Λ W  \n   \t   \t  \t  \t   + \t   \t  \t    \t  +\n \t   \t   \t  \t  \t   Λ \t W \t D I \t D H F \t H\n  (19)  The  following  lemmas  are  proven  in  Subsection  A-C.  Let  (A) diag  be the diagonal matrix formed by the diagonal of A.  \nLemma 2 : For any positive semi-definite matrix Λ 1  and any  matrix W 1 , we have  \nLemma  3 :  The  optimal  solution  to  the  problem  below  is  achieved at real-valued Λ 1  and W 1 . \nFrom Lemma 1-3, we have                       \nComparing (23a)  with  (23b), we  conclude  that  the optimal Λ 1   and W 1  to the problem in (18) should be real diagonal matrices.  Finally, from (9) and (17), we have \nwhich  is  real  diagonal  provided  that  Λ 1   and  W 1   are.  Hence  Theorem 1 holds.   \t   \t   \t   \t               A.   Proof of Lemma 1 \nLet  B  be  a  Hermitian  matrix.  Consider  any  matrix  A  satisfying H AA B , i.e., B−AA H  is positive semi-definite. The  diagonal  elements  of  B−AA H   are  non-negative,  i.e., \n(| | \t | | ) 0 i i \t i i \t i j j i B \t A \t A ≠ − \t + \t ≥ ∑ \t ,  for  i  =  1,  \u2026,  N.  Thus,  B i,i  −  |A i,i | 2   ≥  0,  for  i  =  1,  \u2026,  N,  or  equivalently, \n                 { \t } \t ( ) ( ) \t ( ) { \t } H H \t diag diag \t diag | \t | ⊆ A AA B \t A A \t A \t B \t .  (24)  Letting A = W 1  and B = Λ 1 ,  we see  that the region of W 1   for \nW W \t Λ  is  contained  in  that  for  \t H 1 diag 1 diag \t 1 diag ( ) ( ) \t ( ) W \t W \t Λ \t .  Therefore, (20) holds.    B.   Proof of Lemma 2 \nWe first consider the case of M = N. Let  l U  be an M-by-M  diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements being  ±1. There are  in  total  2 M   different  such  matrices  indexed  from  l  =  1  to  2 M .  Then (cf., [15]) \n1 2\nFor  the  function  defined  in  (19),  we  note  that  both  H 2 F 2   and  I+|F 2 −1 G 2 | 2   are  Hermitian  matrices,  and  that  U 2   is  a  Haar  matrix.  From  Property  2  in  Section  II.B,  \t 2 2 l \t l U H F U and \n( | \t | ) l \t l − + U I F G U  have  the  same  distribution  as  H 2 F 2   and  I+|F 2 −1 G 2 | 2 , respectively. Thus, (19) can be written as:       \n \t  = \t +   \t  \n  \t  \t    \t  \t  +  \t \n  \t   \t  \t  Λ W \t I \t U D U U H F U\nΛ \t W \t U D U H W \t U I F G \t U\n \t  +   \t \n \t  \t  = + \t  \t  \t   \t  + \t  \t \n \t  U ΛU \t U W U \t D Λ W I \t D H F\n Note  that  logdet(·)  is  concave  and  ( \t ) 1 1 , ψ Λ W  is  an  affine  function  of  Λ 1   and  W 1 .

Thus, we have \n \t  ≤ \t =  \t \nwhere  step  (a)  follows  from  (26),  step  (b)  follows  from  the  Jensen\u2019s inequality, and step (c) utilizes (25). Thus, (21) holds  for the case of M = N. \n1 2\nwhere  A  is  an  arbitrary  M-by-N  matrix,  left l \t l = U \t U ,  and  right l U   is the N-by-N principle submatrix of  left l U with index set {1, \u2026,  N}.  The  other  reasoning  literally  follows  the  case  of  M  =  N,  except for some minor modifications. The treatment for M < N  is similar. This completes the proof of Lemma 2. \nBy  definition  in  (17),  Λ 1   is  Hermitian.  This  implies  that,  any diagonal Λ 1  is real-valued. Thus, we only need to consider  W 1 . We first show that, for any diagonal matrix Λ 1  and W 1 ,      \nSince det(A) = det(A * ) for any Hermitian matrix A, we have  ( ) \t ( ) ( \t ) * 1 1 \t 1 2 2 2 1 , \t E log det ϕ \t σ  \t  = \t +   \t   Λ W \t I \t D H F  \n   \t   \t     \t   \t \n \t  \t    Λ \t W \t D\nH W \t I F G \t F H\nFrom  Property  2  in  Section  II.B,  (H 2 F 2 ) *   and  (I+|F 2 −1 G 2 | 2 ) *   have  the  same  distribution  as  H 2 F 2   and  I+|F 2 −1 G 2 | 2 ,  respectively. Thus, we obtain  \nwhere  step  (a)  follows  from  (30),  and  (b)  from  the  Jensen\u2019s  inequality  (as  φ(Λ 1 ,  W 1 )  is  concave).  The  equality  in  (31)  is  achieved when W 1  is a real-valued matrix.  \nConsider  the  optimization  problem  in  (22).  For  any  diagonal  matrix  W 1   satisfying  \t H 1 1 \t 1 W W \t Λ ,  we  obtain \nRe{ }Re{ } W \t W \t Λ . This implies that Re{W 1 } falls into the  feasible  region  of  (22)  if  W 1   does.  Together  with  (31),  we  conclude that the optimal W 1  to (22) is real-valued. \nThis  work  was  partially  supported  by  a  grant  from  the  University Grants Committee (Project No. AoE/E-02/08) of the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.
