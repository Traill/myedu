The results are demonstrated by an illustrative example.\nIn this section, the p -constrained least squares problem is ﬁrst formulated. A critical point is then deﬁned and its local optimality is touched on with its geometric property. A critical path is ﬁnally deﬁned and its variation is discussed.\nwhere X := [x 1 x 2 · · · x n ] T ∈ R n×d is a known matrix with its columns being the design variables, β o ∈ R n consists of the explanatory parameters which are unknown, and v ∈ R d is the noise vector. Under this simple model, the p -constrained least squares problem is formulated as follows:\n|β| p , β ∈ R, and c ≥ 0 is a nonnegative constant. When p ≤ 1, it is known that the function F p (β) has a sparsity seeking property [3]; i.e., a solution of the p -constrained least squares problem ( P c ) tends to be sparse.\nIn the speciﬁc case that p = 1, the p -constrained least squares is called Lasso [10]. In this case, it has been shown that the solution path of ( P c ) with the constant c shifting from zero to inﬁnity is piecewise linear and that the path can be constructed by the homotopy algorithm, or equivalently by the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm with a simple modiﬁcation [11].\nWe address the case that p < 1 in this work. In this case, the function F p is nonconvex and this makes signiﬁcant differences from the case that p = 1. We present some remarkable differences below as will become clearer in the following section.\n(a) ( P c ) has multiple local minima in general for some choices of the c value.\n(c) ( P c ) is essentially different from the p -penalized least squares problem:\nWe deﬁne the set of critical points for ( P c ) and (Q λ ) as C := {The set of all critical points of (P c ) for some c ≥ 0}\n= {The set of all critical points of (Q λ ) for some λ ≥ 0} . The equality above is clear from the deﬁnition of a critical point. Some important facts are listed below.\n1) A local minimum of ( Q λ ) is a local minimum of (P c ), but the converse is not always true. (This will be seen in Section III-A.)\n2) The correspondence between c and λ c has multiplicity. (This will be seen in Section III-C.)\n3) The paths of global minima of ( P c ) and (Q λ ) are both subsets of C.\n4) The path of global minima of ( Q λ ) is always discontin- uous [7].\n5) The path of global minima of ( P c ) is possibly discon- tinuous [7].\nEach critical point is associated with a certain value of c, and in general there exist multiple critical points that are associated with a single value of c. It is clear by deﬁnition that the origin is the unique critical point that is associated with c = 0. 2 When the c value increases from zero, the paths of the multiple critical points associated with each value of c form multiple curves in R n . We call each of such curves a critical path of (P\nWe now regard each point on a critical path as a function of c, and denote it by β(c). How does β(c) behave for a slight variation of c? It is described by ˙β(c) := d dc β(c). Let ˆ\nβ := β(c) and ˆλ := λ c in (6) and differentiate its both sides with respect to c. Then, with simple manipulations, we obtain the equation of critical path:\nis nonsingular. A critical path is a piecewise smooth curve governed by (7). The path always starts from the origin (i.e., β(0) = 0) and may end at an OLS solution β ∗ ∈ argmin β∈R n ϕ(β) at which (6) holds for ˆλ = 0. As it is deﬁned as a maximal continuous curve, a critical path is more likely to continue from β(0) to β ∗ than the path of global minima of ( P c ). In the following section, we deﬁne the greedy path which is one of the possible critical paths starting at the origin and which coincides with the path of global minima of (P\n) if the global-minima path is continuous. (We do not give any precise proof for this.)\nThis section studies the greedy path and clariﬁes its link to OMP. Following the condition for local optimality, how to construct the greedy path is presented. The correspondence between ( P c ) and (Q λ ) is ﬁnally discussed.\n) in local optimality). We stress that the positive semidef- initeness condition is necessary for ( Q λ ) but not for (P c ). This is because, regarding the inequality in (14), the equality holds only when the equality holds in (9), which is the case that ˆ β + lies on the surface ∂B c (the boundary of the constraint set). The surface ∂B c is nearly the tangent plane at ˆ β for a sufﬁciently small δ and, if ˆβ + lies on the tangent plane, we have ∇ I ϕ(ˆβ) T (I) = 0, implying that the inequality (8) holds automatically due to the positive semideﬁniteness of ∇ I ∇ I ϕ(ˆβ). The bound is loose when the vector is orthogonal to the tangent plane. Therefore, the condition (8) may holds even if the Hessian matrix is not positive semideﬁnite. Indeed, there is a case that a vector ˆ β is a local minimum of ( P c ) but is a saddle of (Q λ ) (see Section IV); this is the case that (8) holds but the Hessian matrix is not positive semideﬁnite.\nWe present how to construct the greedy path β(c) and shows its link to OMP. It is basically an extension of the LARS algorithm from p = 1 to p < 1. We mention that a critical path can never intersect with itself since a local minimum of (P\n) lies on the boundary of the constraint set B c unless it is a global minimum of ϕ. As stated in Section II, the path is a piecewise smooth curve. We consider the breakpoint condition. For a ﬁxed I, the path is smooth as its variation is governed by (7). At a breakpoint, therefore, the active index set I should change.\nNow the question is under what condition such an active- index-set change can happen. For simplicity, consider the case that I := supp(β(c)) changes from I = {i ∗ } to I inc = {i ∗ , j ∗ }. 3 At a breakpoint β(c 1 ), the path leaves the β i ∗ coordinate and goes on along the β i ∗ - β j ∗ plane. On this plane, (6) should still hold for the incremented active index set I inc . We now track the path in a reverse way toward the breakpoint β(c 1 ) on the β i ∗ - β j ∗ plane. Referring to (4), it is seen that lim β j∗ →0 |ψ (β j ∗ )| = ∞. Since |ψ (β i ∗ )| < ∞ at the breakpoint β(c 1 ), (6) suggests that ∇ I ϕ(β(c 1 )) = ∂ ∂i ∗ ϕ(β(c 1 )) = 0 with λ c = 0. In an analogous way, we can verify in general that the breakpoint condition is given by\n∇ I ϕ(β(c)) = 0, \t (16) where I := supp(β(c)). The condition (16) implies that a breakpoint β(c) is a minimizer of the function ϕ over the subspace M I = {β : supp(β) = I = supp(β(c))}.\nAt each breakpoint including the starting point, we need to select one of the inactive indices. Our strategy is greedy; i.e., an index is selected in such a way that the value of ϕ is locally minimized in the vicinity of each breakpoint. How can we ﬁnd the greedy path? Let us discuss which index to select at the starting point β(0) := 0. Indeed, the selection can be done in the same way as the LARS algorithm. Namely,\nϕ(0) is selected. The reason is given as follows. Consider two closed balls: an 1 ball with a small radius ρ > 0 and an p ball with a radius ρ p . (The two balls touch each other at the vertices of the balls.) The LARS path goes along the β i ∗ coordinate, meaning that one of the vertices of the 1 ball on the coordinate minimizes ϕ\n∂ ∂β i ϕ(0) if i = i ∗ 0\nβ f λ (β )\na multi-valued function, i.e., multiple points β(λ) correspond to a single λ-value. The greedy path is indeed formed by a collection of some critical paths of ( Q λ ), each of which is a single-valued function of λ by deﬁnition. The following proposition offers an interesting link between OMP and ( Q λ ). Proposition 2 (Link between OMP and ( Q λ )). Suppose that the greedy path continues to an OLS solution. Each step-by- step solution generated by OMP is the limit of a sequence of critical points of ( Q λ ) as λ → 0.\nProof: The claim is readily veriﬁed by Proposition 1 and Lemma 2. \t 2\nThe results presented in this section can be better understood through an illustrative example in the following section.\nWe consider the orthogonal case XX T = I. Let ϕ(β) := 1 2 β − β ∗ 2 2 and p = 0.5, where β ∗ = [2, 1] T . In this case, Fig. 1 clearly illustrates the correspondence between ( P c ) and (Q\nβ(c 1 ) of the greedy path, and the second one β OMP 2 is the end point β(c 2 ). This clearly demonstrates Proposition 1.\nNow, consider the horizontal line again mentioned in Sec- tion IV-B. The four intersection points correspond in Fig. 1(a) to (i) a point around the origin on the blue segment, (ii) two points around β(c 1 ) (one on the green segment and one on the red segment), and (ii) a point around β(c 2 ) on the gold segment. Now we gradually shift the horizontal line in Fig. 1(b) downward up to the level of λ c = 0. Then, how do the four points in Fig. 1(a) behave? Clearly, (i) the point around the origin approaches the origin, (ii) the two points around β(c 1 ) approach β(c 1 ), and (iii) the point around β(c 2 ) approach β(c 2 ). This demonstrates Proposition 2.\nThis paper has investigated the p -constrained least squares (P c ) and its critical path. The greedy path has turned out to contain the step-by-step solutions of OMP as its breakpoints. The path has also turned out to be formed by a collection of critical paths of the p -penalized least squares ( Q λ ). This is understood by the fact that λ c takes the zero value at every breakpoint, implied also by the remarkable difference between (P\nThe links between OMP and the p least squares problems are more direct than that between OMP and the 1 minimiza- tion. It should be remarked however that the links do not directly imply any link between OMP and existing approx- imate solvers for the p -penalized least squares problem. In fact, an approximate solution obtained by one of those solvers corresponds not necessarily to the greedy path but possibly to another critical path. Although we have focused on the greedy path, most of the results presented in this paper can be applied to the other paths. The outcomes of the study will thus play a central role in polishing such an approximate solution further based on possible additional requirements. This simple consideration indicates that the new insight into critical paths of the p -constrained least squares will be of great use in devising an efﬁcient approach to sparse optimization.\nAcknowledgment: This work was partially supported by JSPS Grants-in-Aid (24760292)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S.
