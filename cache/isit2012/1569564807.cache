From a signal processing view point, data recording systems in 2-D have advantages over traditional 1- D systems. 2-D recording systems are less sensitive to timing instabilities due to wider read sensory elements for tracking timing drifts. With efﬁcient 2-D signal detection methods, guard bands between 2-D coded blocks can be eliminated, thereby, improving format efﬁciency. Thus, 2-D ISI can be beneﬁcially combatted to realize SNR gains by clever signal processing.\nThere is a wide spectrum of 1-D detection techniques ranging from decision feedback equalization (DFE) to the optimal MAP algorithm that can be extended to the 2-D case. 2-D DFE methods are easy to implement but suffer from error propagation. The 1-D MAP algorithm is theoretically optimal and is the best-in-class detector for minimizing bit-error rate. However, unlike 1-D MAP detection [4] that can be practically realized, 2-D MAP detection is NP-complete [5]. It is difﬁcult to realize a 2-D trellis spanning signal dimensions greater than just a few bits. We need low complexity 2-D signal detection algorithms based on 1-D schemes to get close to near optimal 2-D MAP detection performance. Several authors have considered various approaches towards 2-D detection. Nelson et al [6] derived a multi-dimensional decision feedback\nscheme for 2-D equalization. Marrow and Wolf [7] considered 2-D DFE and MAP-DFE hybrid equalization schemes over an L −shaped ISI channel. Wu et al [8] developed 2-D iterative detection and decoding scheme for a separable 2-D ISI system. In most practical systems, 2-D ISI is generally non-separable. Shental et al [9] developed a generalized belief propagation approach that achieves near maximum-likelihood (ML) per- formance for 2-D ISI channels. Simulations in [9] considered (20 ×20) 2-D data sizes with smaller 2-D ISI masks (2×2). It is practically difﬁcult to simulate conditions for higher ISI shapes and sizes using the method in [9]. In a recent prior work, Chen et al [10] developed an iterative soft-decision feedback zig- zag MAP algorithm. This method demonstrated performance close to nearly optimal detection with lower complexity and compared well with the method presented in [9].\nIn this paper we are interested in iterative multi-row/column MAP detectors for handling 2-D ISI. In section II, we derive the general form of the multi-track MAP detector considering the feedback information from neighboring bit cells outside local 2-D ISI span. We use this algorithm subsequently to develop a 2-D iterative multi-row/column turbo-detector. Simulation results over the AWGN channel are discussed in section III with concluding remarks in section IV. The main contribution of this work is a set of low complexity tractable 2-D detection methods based on the turbo principle.\nConsider the detection of an M × N equiprobable 2-D independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) binary signal x with elements x(k, l) ∈ {−1, +1} from received image y with elements\ny(m, n) = g(m, n) + w(m, n), \t (1) where g(m, n) is the 2-D convolution, deﬁned as\nIn the above equations h(k, l) are the elements of a 2-D ﬁnite impulse response/2-D blurring mask and w(m, n) are zero mean i.i.d. Gaussian random variables (r.v.s). The double sum is computed over the non-zero support of h(m −k, n−l). The discrete model in (1) and (2) is applicable to most 2-D\nISI based storage channels post front-end signal processing after dealing with channel/media distortions and whitening the media noise.\nWe present 2-D non-iterative and iterative MAP based detection algorithms in this work and compare their efﬁcacies with single row/column and multi-row/column variations. The trellis of the multi-row/column detector is compliant with the span of the 2-D ISI, while the single-row/column version is approximated by a simpliﬁed 1-D MAP trellis with much lower complexity.\nWe choose a generalized mask shown in part (a) of Figure 1. The coefﬁcients [β −K 1 , · · · , β −1 , 1, β 1 , · · · , β K 1 ] denote horizontal ISI, and the coefﬁcients [α −K 2 , · · · , α −1 , 1, α 1 , · · · , α K 2 ] denote vertical ISI. The size of this mask is (2K 2 + 1) × (2K 1 + 1). The coefﬁcients with negative indices denote the causal part; while the positive indices denote the anti-causal part. Practical 2-D runlength-limited ISI channels in recording systems [13] could be represented by this \u2018band-aid\u2019 shape mask. In practice, the span of 2-D diagonal interference over arbitrary ISI shapes is small due to the physical constraints [11]. Though we choose an asymmetric runlength-limited shaped mask throughout this paper for the sake of illustration, this assumption can be readily generalized for any arbitrary 2-D ISI shape within our framework.\nAs in the conventional BCJR algorithm [4], we do the scan based on the forward-backward procedure. To compute the received image y, we assume a boundary of −1 pixels around x; the detector uses this boundary condition so that the MAP\ntrellis could begin and end in an \u2018all -1\u2019 state (zero state bi- polar mapped to \u2018-1\u2019) as demonstrated in [4].\nFor the generalized 2-D mask shown in part (a) of Figure 1, given the trellis state\ns −K 1 ,h , . . . , s −1,h , s 1,h . . . , s +K 1 ,h ], \t (3) the input vector\nand the received vector sequence Z (i) {y i,j } 1 ≤j≤N , where the vector y i,j is the local received samples for trellis stage j at ith row, deﬁned as:\nWe compute the a-posteriori probability for the multi-row detector as,\nusing a modiﬁed BCJR algorithm. As in [4], we set\nβ i,j (s) = P {y i,a } j+1 ≤a≤N |S j = s , γ i,j (s , s) = P (S j = s, y i,j |S j −1 = s );\nthe state transition probability γ is computed at every stage along the trellis. Using the branch metrics (γ\u2019s), the α and β terms are computed using the forward-backward recursion:\nUsing the equations (8), (9), and (10), equation (6) is computed as\nTo estimate the pixel located at (i, j + K 1 ), we marginalize λ u i,j −K1 i,j −K 1 (S j −K 1 ) over all the remaining pixels in the input vector u i,j as\nThe delay K 1 in the index accounts for the ISI shape and boundary conditions.\nIf L(i, j) > 0 pixel (i, j) is detected as +1, otherwise, it is detected as −1.\nThe conditional probability γ i,j (s , s) is decomposed as a product of two other conditional probabilities based on Bayesian rule:\n= P (y i,j |S j = s, S j −1 = s )P (S j = s |S j −1 = s ) = P (y i,j |S j = s, S j −1 = s )P (u i,j ).\nFor the non-iterative detection scheme, there is no a-priori information. We assume that all the input pixels are equally likely when computing P (u i,j ) in equation (14). Since the ﬁrst conditional probability term in the product of (14) is Gaussian distributed, we compute it as,\n(15) In the second step of equation (15), we assume statistical\nindependence in evaluating the conditional probabilities terms. This assumption is not exact, but is a good practical approx- imation towards a realizable algorithm. For the conditional probabilities in equation (15), the expectations are computed based on the index (m, n) of the received sample y and the components of the 2D mask shown in part (a) of Figure 1. Given m = i and n = j, the expectation is\n(17) There are i − m (ω 1,v through ω i −m,v ) feedback pixels in the vertical direction. In the horizontal direction, there are 2K 1 − 1 feedback pixels (ω 2,h through ω K 1 ,h and ω −K 1 ,h through ω −1,h ), as also shown in part (c) of Figure 1.\nGiven i < m ≤ i + K 2 and n = j − 1, the expectation is computed as\nThere are m − i feedback pixels in vertical direction (ω 1,v through ω i −m,v ). In the horizontal direction, there are 2K 1 − 1 feedback pixels (ω 2,h through ω K 1 ,h and ω −K 1 ,h through ω −1,h ), as shown in part (d) of Figure 1.\nThe total number of the feedback pixels in the vertical direction is |i−m| depending on the index m. In the horizontal direction, we have a total of 2K 1 − 1 feedback pixels.\nPractical channels usually have small ISI span. For purposes of computational illustration, we choose a simple 2-D symmet- ric mask h = [0 α 0; β 1 β; 0 α 0] of size 3 × 3 as shown in Figures 2 and 3.\nA trellis based on the 3 × 3 mask h has 5 state pixels (i.e. s 0 through s 4 and 3 input pixels as shown in Figure 3) . The 3 input pixels lead to 8 branches coming into/going out from one state. There are 4 feedback pixels (ω 0 , ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 ) which are\noptionally used to compute the state transition probability. The a-priori information for both the input pixels and the feedback pixels come from the previous detector iteration cycle. With no feedback, they can be assumed to be zero a-priori. With feedback, extrinsic information from the previous detector will be scaled and set as feedback. We will discuss this in more detail in section II-B.\nThe branch metrics are the squared Euclidean distances (SEDs) between the branch output vectors and the received pixel vectors y i,j \t [y i −1,j−1 , y i,j , y i+1,j −1 ] as shown in Figure 3. The sample y i,j corresponds to the position of s 1 or s 0 . The samples y i −1,j−1 and y i −1,j+1 correspond to the positions s 3 and s 4 respectively.\nFor the 3 × 3 mask shown in Figure 3, the equation (15) will be modiﬁed as\nP (y i,j | S j = s, S j −1 = s ) =                                       \nWe deﬁne the non-iterative algorithm with three central rows without any feedback pixels (with the trellis deﬁnition as in Figure 3) as \u2018algorithm A\u2019.\nWe deﬁne the non-iterative algorithm with three central rows utilizing equally likely feedback information according to equation (19) as \u2018algorithm B\u2019. In other words, for algorithm B, in the computation of P (y i,j | S j = s, S j −1 = s ), we use the vector y i,j = [y i −1,j−1 , y i,j , y i+1,j −1 ] as opposed to y i,j = [y i,j ] for algorithm A.\nFollowing the above example, over a (2K 1 + 1) × (2K 2 + 1) 2-D ISI span, an algorithm processing R = max(2K 1 + 1, 2K 2 + 1) adjacent rows/data tracks simultaneously yields better performance at the cost of higher complexity.\nThe 2-D iterative scheme takes advantage of different error decisions and noise distribution at the output of the row and column detectors by feeding scaled extrinsic information back and forth. We assume statistical independence when computing the probability of the input and feedback pixels using the a-priori information (i.e. the probabilities of all the feedback pixels as per equation (19) and P (u i,j ) as per equation (14)). The analysis for dependent statistics is generally difﬁcult and is a future research topic.\nTo compute the a-priori probability for a speciﬁed pixel y i,j from the incoming extrinsic information of this pixel L in e (y i,j ), we applied the following equations:\nwhere ˜ y i,j denotes the a-priori information on pixel y i,j . We deﬁne the iterative 2-D algorithm using the a-priori information of the feedback pixels as\u2018algorithm C\u2019. We deﬁne the iterative 2-D algorithm taking into a-priori information for both input and feedback pixels using equation (19) as \u2018algorithm D\u2019.\nWe deﬁne a simpliﬁed 2-D detection scheme that we term \u2018algorithm E\u2019 as follows. We deﬁne a reduced state comprising of two adjacent pixels s 0 and s 1 in the row direction as shown in Figure 2. An input pixel which is a branch connecting two neighboring states determines the next state. Two extra feedback pixels (ω 0 , ω 1 ) are added as shown in Figure 2 to account for the local 2-D ISI shape. The state transition probability is computed using equation (19). The a-priori information from the feedback pixels and P (u i,j ) is utilized in an iterative fashion.\nFigure 4 shows the block diagram of the iteration detection scheme. The row/column detectors pass soft extrinsic informa-\ntion (LLRs) between each other via LLR scaling δ as shown in Figure 4. The scaling process avoids quick convergence and error propagation during successive iterations.\nThe log-likelihood ratio L(i, j) during a current iteration depends on the a-priori information L in e (i, j) to the current (row or column) detector and its own extrinsic information. Extrinsic information L out (i, j) is passed to the next detector as a-priori information according to\nWe present Monte Carlo simulation results of the 2-D detection algorithms and compare their performance. All simu- lations employ a random 64 ×64 binary image with a boundary corresponding to the mask size so that the trellis could start and end with an all zero state. The SNR is deﬁned as in [12]:\nwhere σ 2 ω is the variance of the Gaussian r.v.s ω(m, n) in (2). We assume α = β = 0.25 in the 3 × 3 mask h, for simulation purposes.\nIterative algorithms C and D employ a 5-iteration scheme with scale factor δ = 0.8. Algorithm E uses a 10-iteration scheme with weight δ = 0.5. The performance of the algo- rithms converge, i.e. no more signiﬁcant SNR gain, after these numbers of iterations mentioned here.\nAlgorithm B performs much better than algorithm A, since the state transition probability is computed more accurately (i.e. more contributing terms dealing with ISI rather than in the single case).\nAlgorithms C and D spanning multi-rows/columns perform better than algorithm E with simpliﬁed trellis because handling\nmultiple row/columns have better 2-D ISI cancellation than a single-row/column iterative detector. As shown in Figure 5, algorithm E at BER 10 −6 is within 0.5 dB of the algorithms C and D. At BER 10 −6 , the iterative algorithms have 2 dB SNR gain over the non-iterative ones.\nAlgorithm E with 10 iterations is 0.3% as complex as algo- rithm D with 5 iterations (complexity computations avoided due to page limitations) with a SNR loss of about 0.5 dB at BER 10 −6 . The performance of the algorithm D is within 0.1 dB of the ML estimate as per [14].\nRealizing 2-D MAP detection is practically impossible. We presented several MAP based signal detection algorithms for 2-D ISI channels. Turbo feedback based multi-track MAP algorithm 2 dB SNR gain over non-iterative methods. We also presented and evaluated several techniques that tradeoff performance for complexity."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R. Wood"},{"name":"M. Williams"},{"name":"A. Kavcic"},{"name":"J.
