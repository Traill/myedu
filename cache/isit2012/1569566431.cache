F. Beckley [2] and J. Verhoeff [3], when transmitting a sequence of digits, the most common transmission errors made by human operators are the following:\nAmong them, single errors and adjacent transpositions, are the most prevalent ones. The recognition of these errors is usually done by appending a check digit a n+1 to a given sequence a 1 · · · a n of information digits.\nSome well-known examples of the check digit systems used in practice are the European Article Number (EAN) Code, the Universal Product Code (UPC) and the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) Code.\nSince single errors and the adjacent transpositions are the most prevalent ones, it is not surprising that research attention was ﬁrst given to design systems over groups with anti- symmetric mappings which ensure these two kinds of errors to be detected. One can refer to a long list of research articles such as [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] and a survey of anti-symmetric mappings in different groups in [10].\nThereafter, possibility of constructing error detecting codes based on quasigroups was discussed in [6]. Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions were established in order to detect adja- cent transpositions and jump transpositions (but only in the\ninformation digits). The control digit involving in both errors were taken into account in [11] eventually. A comprehensive investigation on a check digit system over a quasigroup was conducted in [12], [13], where necessary and sufﬁcient conditions were established in order to detect each of the ﬁve error types. So far, the approaches have been taken are in general analytical.\nIn [1], M. Niemenmaa proposed a check digit system for hexadecimal numbers, based on a suitable automorphism of the elementary abelian group of order 16. Its design is concise and elegant, with the capacity of detecting all the ﬁve types of errors listed above. Two use cases of hexadecimal numbers in real life applications are worth mentioning. They are the International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) which enables the identiﬁcation of any kind of audiovisual works and the International Mobile Equipment Identiﬁer (MEID) which is unique for each mobile station.\nIn this paper, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review the check digit sys- tem proposed in [1]. By interpreting its check equation in terminology of matrix algebra [18] , we generalize its idea for hexadecimal numbers to a group of order p k , for k ≥ 1 and a prime p. To serve the purpose of detecting all the ﬁve types of errors, we explore the properties of the desirable matrices which are suitable for the system design, the number of them and the asymptotic probability of ﬁnding them as well.\nMoreover, we deﬁne the following two categories of jump errors, which include and further extend the error types 2)-5).\nLet t ≥ 0, and as t = 0 we have b 1 · · · b t ∈ ∅. It is easy to see that, the error types 2) and 4): adjacent transposition and jump transposition, can be regarded as t-jump transpositions for t = 0 and t = 1, respectively; 3) and 5): twin error and jump twin error, can be regarded as t-jump twin errors for t = 0 and t = 1, respectively.\nThese two kinds of errors were ﬁrst taken into consideration in [14]. They are of our interest, not only because they simplify the list of the error types, but also because they may occur more frequently than expected, especially when people input data while using a new keyboard with an unexpected layout,\nor when they forget to switch the language to the right one they intend to use.\nWe deﬁne t c , the largest jump length such that for any t ≤ t c , all the t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors will be detected, to be the capacity of the system to detect these two kinds of generalized jump errors. A check digit system capable of detecting all the single errors, and double errors of maximum jump length, is desirable due to its improved performance on the error detection capability.\nConsider our proposed systems over a group of order p k . For p = 2, we are able to construct systems that reach the capacity of the jump-error detection: 2 k − 3. To do that, we employ matrices of a special kind, those with primitive polynomials as their characteristic polynomials. Applying the similar approach to the systems for an odd p, we show that the maximum jump- length that can be covered in the range of error detection is (p k − 1)/2 − 2.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: First in Section II, we brieﬂy review the recently introduced check digit system for hexadecimal numbers. Its generalization to a group of order p k is presented in Section III. In Section IV, we discuss on the capability of the jump-error detection of the proposed systems. We give some proofs in Section V and ﬁnally conclude in Section VI.\nIn this section, we brieﬂy review the check digit system for hexadecimal numbers proposed in [1].\nIn [1], the hexadecimal numbers are represented as elements of the abelian group G = Z 2 ⊕ Z 2 ⊕ Z 2 ⊕ Z 2 by denoting 0 = (0, 0, 0, 0), 1 = (0, 0, 0, 1), ..., 9 = (1, 0, 0, 1), A = (1, 0, 1, 0), B = (1, 0, 1, 1), C = (1, 1, 0, 0), D = (1, 1, 0, 1),\nE = (1, 1, 1, 0), and F = (1, 1, 1, 1). It is easy to see that in G, 0 is the identity element and the inverse of each element is the element itself.\nIf the information digits a 1 , · · · , a n and the check digit a n+1 are interpreted as elements of the group (G, +), then a n+1 can be determined by the check equation\nBy using this speciﬁc P, the system can detect all the ﬁve types of errors listed in the introduction. As noted, as a permutation, P is 15-cycle and ﬁxes only the element 0. So is P 2 as well.\n   \n1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n   \nIn last section, the check digit system is designed only for hexadecimal numbers. Inspired by it but working with a check equation in terms of matrix equation, we provide a general design of check digit systems which are based on the use of elementary abelian p-groups of order p k . The proposed systems keep the ability to detect all the ﬁve error types 1)-5).\nConsider a check digit system for p k numbers: 0, 1, 2, · · · , p k − 1, where p is a prime and k > 0. Similarly to the approach in Section II-A, we represent these p k numbers as elements of the abelian group G = Z 1 p ⊕ Z 2 p ⊕ · · · ⊕ Z k p , where Z i p = Z p for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Each number corresponds to a k-tuple in G. We take the k-tuple as the base p representation of the number for simplicity.\nDenote the information digits to be a 1 , · · · , a n and the check digit to be a n+1 , all as elements of the group (G, +). We use the check equation (5):\nIt is easy to see that if P is nonsingular, then all single errors will be detected since\nAdditionally, in order to detect all adjacent transpositions, P has to satisfy the condition\nThat is, P − I must be nonsingular as well. Here I is the k × k identity matrix.\nTo satisfy this condition, it requires P 2 − I to be nonsingular. We note that 4) holds once 2) are 3) are satisﬁed.\nTheorem 3.1: A check digit system for p k numbers, with the ability to detect all the errors of types 1)-5), can be designed by using the check equation (5) and choosing a matrix P over Z p such that P, P − I, P + I and P 2 + I are all nonsingular.\nIf p = 2, then over Z 2 , P + I is the same as P − I; and P 2 +I = (P+I) 2 . Straightforwardly, we can simplify Theorem 3.1 into the following theorem for the special case p = 2.\nTheorem 3.2: A check digit system for 2 k numbers, with the ability to detect all the errors of types 1)-5), can be designed by using the check equation (5) and choosing a binary matrix P such that both P and P + I are nonsingular.\nAccording to Theorem 3.2, binary matrices with no eigen- values of 0 or 1 are of our interest. As proved in [15], the number of such k × k matrices P is 2 k(k−1)/2 N k , where\nThe sequence begins 0, 2, 48, 5824, 2887680,..., for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , respectively. In particular, P as deﬁned in (3) is one of those 5824 suitable ones for k = 4. As k increases, the asymptotic probability of such a matrix for the given order, is approaching 0.0833986 as shown in [15].\nAccording to Theorem 3.1, in order to design a check digit system with the ability to detect all the errors of types 1)-5) by the check equation (5), we need to use a matrix P over Z p such that P, P − I, P + I and P 2 + I are all nonsingular.\na) a prime p : p ≡ 1 mod 4: It is known that for a prime p, if p ≡ 1 mod 4, then −1 is a quadratic residue modulo p. In this case, there is an α ∈ Z p such that α 2 ≡ −1 mod p. Straightforwardly, P 2 + I can be further factored into (P + αI) · (P − αI). We note that if P 2 + I is nonsingular, it implies that both P + αI and P − αI are nonsingular as well.\nAccording to Theorem 3.1, the matrices over Z p with no eigenvalues of 0, 1, −1, α, −α are of our interest. Let γ k be the number of invertible k × k matrices over Z p , and let ρ k be the number of k × k matrices over Z p with no eigenvalues of 0, 1, −1, α, −α. We have\nAs k increases, the asymptotic probability of such a matrix is r≥1 (1 − 1/p r ) 4 by the following theorem.\nb) a prime p : p ≡ 3 mod 4: If a prime p have p ≡ 3 mod 4, then −1 is a not quadratic residue modulo p. In this case, z 2 + 1 is an irreducible polynomial over Z p . As a direct result, P 2 + I can not be further factored.\nLet υ k be the number of k × k matrices over Z p which are suitable for the digit check system deﬁned in Theorem 3.1. These matrices are those without factors of z, z − 1, z + 1 or z 2 + 1 in their characteristic polynomial. We have\nAs k increases, the asymptotic probability of such a matrix is r≥1 (1 − 1/p r ) 2 (1 − 1/p 2r ) by the following theorem.\nThe check digit systems proposed in Theorem 3.1 are able to detect all the ﬁve types errors listed in the introduction. In this section, we explore their error detection ability beyond that by considering the more generally deﬁned error types 6) and 7). In particular, we look into the capacity of the system to detect these two kinds of jump errors, which is illustrate by t c , the largest jump length such that for any t ≤ t c , all the t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors will be detected. Check digit systems which detect all the single errors and double jump-errors within the capacity range t c are of our interest.\nConsider the check digit system for p k numbers over the group G = Z 1 p ⊕Z 2 p ⊕· · ·⊕Z k p , where Z i p = Z p for 1 ≤ i ≤ k and a prime p. We apply the check equation (5). To detect all the t-jump transpositions, P has to satisfy the condition\nIt requires that P t+1 + I must be nonsingular. We note that when P is over Z 2 , P t+1 − I and P t+1 + I are the same.\nIn order to achieve the capacity of the system to detect these two kinds of jump errors of the largest jump range t c ,\nit is required that P − I, P 2 − I, · · · P t c +1 − I and P + I, P 2 + I, · · · , P t c +1 + I are all nonsingular matrices over Z p .\nIn general, we have the following upper bound for t c . Lemma 4.1:\nProof: Consider f (z), the characteristic polynomial of a nonsingular matrix P with deg f (z) = k. By [18, Lemma 3.1], there exists a positive integer e ≤ p k −1 such that f (z) | z e −1. Replacing z by P in f (z) we have f (P) = 0. In addition that f (z) | z e − 1, we obtain P e − I = 0, for e ≤ p k − 1. In order to fullﬁl 6)\u2019, we have that t + 1 (thus t c + 1) must be less than e. Therefore, we have t c ≤ p k − 3.\nLet f (z) be the characteristic polynomial of a nonsingular matrix P. We have the following lemma.\nLemma 4.2: If f (z) is irreducible, then for any non-zero polynomial g(z), g(P) is nonsingular if f (z) g(z).\nProof: If f (z), as the characteristic polynomial of P, is irreducible, then it is also the minimal polynomial of P such that f (P) = 0, where 0 is the k × k all-zero matrix. If f (z)\ng(z), then by Euclid\u2019s algorithm, there are p(z) and q(x) such that\nIf f (z), as the characteristic polynomial of P, is a primitive polynomial over Z 2 , then by deﬁnition, the smallest integer e such that f (z) divides z e −1 is e = 2 k −1. For any t < 2 k −1, we have f (z) z t − 1. In addition, by Lemma 4.2, we have that for all t < 2 k − 1, P t − I is nonsingular. Thus a digit check system built on such P is capable of detecting t-jump errors 6) and 7) with jump length < 2 k − 2. This gives us t c ≥ 2 k − 3. In addition that t c ≤ p k − 3 by Lemma 4.1, we conclude with the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.4: Let P be a matrix whose characteristic poly- nomial is a primitive polynomial over Z 2 . Then a check digit system built on P is able to detect all the single errors and t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors for all t ≤ t c .\nIt is easy to check that the binary matrix P as deﬁned in (3), and used for the check digit system for hexadecimal numbers proposed in [1], actually has the primitive polynomial z 4 + z 3 + 1 as its character polynomial. According to Theorem 4.4, the system could detect not only the error types 1)-5), but all the t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors for t ≤ 13.\nIf f (z), as the characteristic polynomial of P, is a primitive polynomial over Z p , then by deﬁnition, the smallest integer e such that f (z) z e − 1 is e = p k − 1. Let m = e/2. We can factor z e − 1 into (z m − 1)(z m + 1). Since f (z) z m − 1, we have f (z) | z m + 1. If we use t c to describe the range of the\njump-error detection of the system built on P. So far we get t c ≤ m − 2.\nFor any m < m, there is no doubt that f (z) z m − 1, since m < e. Now we suppose that there is an m < m such that f (z) | z m + 1. Then we have f (z) | z 2m − 1 with 2m < 2m = e, contrary to the fact that e is the smallest integer such that f (z) | z e − 1 holds. As a conclusion, for any m < m, we have f (z) z m − 1 and f (z) z m + 1. Applying Lemma 4.2, we have for all 1 ≤ t < m, P t − I and P t + I are nonsingular.\nTherefore, a digit check system built on such P is capable of detecting all t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors with jump length < m − 1. This gives us t c = m − 2 for systems based on P of this special kind.\nProof: The above discussion gives the achievability of the theorem. The converse part of the theorem is indicated by [18, Theorem 3.11]. The detailed proof will follow in an extended version of this paper.\nTheorem 4.6: Let P be a matrix whose characteristic poly- nomial is a primitive polynomial over Z p . Then a check digit system built on P is able to detect all the single errors and t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors for all t ≤ t c .\nWe recall that the companion matrix of a monic polynomial g(z) = c 0 + c 1 z + · · · + c k−1 z k−1 + z k of positive degree k over Z p is deﬁned to be the k × k matrix\n       \n0 0 0 . . . 0 −c 0 1 0 0 . . . 0 −c 1 0 1 0 . . . 0 −c 2 .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. .\n       \nIt is known that there are φ(p k −1)/k primitive polynomials of degree k over Z p , where φ(·) is Euler\u2019s Totient function. So given any of the primitive polynomials, an easy construction of matrix P suitable for Theorem 4.4 and Theorem 4.6, is to take the companion matrices of them.\nRegarding the number of matrices which has primitive polynomials as its characteristic polynomials, one can refer to [19]. For instance, over Z 2 it is in total [19]\nIn order to count the number of matrices over Z p which are suitable for the check digit system proposed in Section III, we use the method of cycle index for matrices over ﬁnite ﬁeld which is introduced by Kung [16] and extended by Stong [17]. First we recall the following lemma.\nLemma 5.1: [15] Let A be any set of monic irreducible polynomials with coefﬁcients in Z p . Let µ k be the number of k × k matrices over Z p whose characteristic polynomial factors into powers of elements of A. Then\nLet Φ to be the full set of monic irreducible polynomials with coefﬁcient in Z p . We apply Lemma 5.1.\nTaking A = Φ\\{z} gives us all the invertible matrices over Z p with µ k = γ k . So\nIf p ≡ 1 mod 4, taking A = Φ\\{z, z − 1, z + 1, z − α, z + α} gives us the set of matrices over Z p without any of 0, 1, −1, α, −α as eigenvalues. Thus we have µ k = ρ k and\nIn order to obtain the right side of the above equation, we multiply the right side of (12) by r≥1 (1 − u/p r ) 4 to take out the factors corresponding to the polynomials z − 1, z + 1, z − α, z + α. So we have the statement of Theorem 3.3:\nIf p ≡ 3 mod 4, z 2 + 1 is irreducible over over Z p . Taking A = Φ\\{z, z − 1, z + 1, z 2 + 1} gives us the set of matrices over Z p without z, z − 1, z + 1, z 2 + 1 in their characteristic polynomial. Thus we have µ k = υ k and\nIn order to obtain the right side of the above equation, we multiply the right side of (12) by r≥1 (1−u/p r ) 2 (1−u 2 /p 2r ) to take out the factors corresponding to the polynomials z − 1, z + 1, z 2 + 1. So we have the statement of Theorem 3.5:\nIn this paper, we consider check digit systems which are based on the use of elementary abelian p-groups of order p k , for k ≥ 1 and a prime p. The work is inspired by the check digit system for hexadecimal numbers proposed in [1] which is able to detect all the 1) single errors, 2) adjacent transpositions, 3) twin errors, 4) jump transpositions and 5) jump twin errors.\nIn our treatment, we interpret the check equation in terms of matrix equation. In order to detect all the ﬁve error types which are of most interest in the previous literature, we explore the suitable matrices with desirable properties. We also determine the number of such matrices for a given order k, and the asymptotic probability of ﬁnding them as k tends to ∞.\nFurthermore, we consider two categories of jump errors: 6) t-jump transpositions and 7) t-jump twin errors with t ≥ 0, which include and further extend the double error types of 2)-5). In particular, we are interested in a check digit system, which is capable of detecting all the single errors and double errors of types 6) and 7) with maximum jump length, due to its improved performance on error detection capability. We show that for p = 2, the capacity range of the system to detect these two kinds of generalized jump errors is 2 k − 3; and for an odd prime p, the capacity range is (p k − 1)/2 − 2. Last but not least, using a special kind of matrices whose characteristic polynomials are primitive polynomials, we are able to build the desired check digit system which detects all the errors of type 1) single errors, and double errors of types 6) and 7) within the capacity range."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
