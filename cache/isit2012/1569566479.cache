For a Gaussian net- work with arbitrary number of nodes and connectivity, except for the single unicast/multicast problem where the approximate capacity is characterized [1], very little is known.\nWhen there are multiple information ﬂows in the network, they cause (message) interference to one another, and in general this will reduce the number of degrees of freedom (DoF) available for each user. Recently it has been shown that one can make use of the intermediate nodes to facilitate interference neutralization [2] [3] [4] [5], thereby reducing the effect of message interference. In particular, [5] fully characterized the DoF region of layered two unicast Gaussian networks with constant channel gains. In some situations, full DoF can be achieved for each user.\nInterference neutralization opens various interesting possi- bilities for managing interference in multiple unicast networks. However it requires instantaneous channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) to work. In practice, channel gains are measured at receivers and then fed back to the transmitters with certain delay. In situations when the delay is larger than the channel coherence time, the channel state could have changed. In such cases, the transmitters can only have strictly causal knowledge about the channel states. Under such constraints, interference neutralization is no longer feasible, and a natural question is whether such delayed CSIT can be helpful. The value of such delayed CSIT was demonstrated\nfor MISO broadcast channels in [6], where it enabled a boost of DoF strictly beyond that when no CSIT is available. For MIMO interference channels with delayed CSIT [7] [8] [9], and the 2 × 2 × 2 network [9] [10], a strict improvement over the case without CSIT was also demonstrated.\nHowever, in a network with arbitrary number of nodes and connectivity, how to make use of delayed transmitter CSI and what is the best-achievable DoF is unsettled even for two unicast Gaussian networks. In this paper, we make some progress, by answering the following question: in layered two unicast Gaussian networks, what is the necessary and sufﬁcient condition when one can make use of delayed CSIT to increase the DoF region strictly beyond the time-sharing DoF region? It turns out that the answer coincides with that under instantaneous CSIT [5], and the condition is that there is no omniscient node [4] in the network 1 . Moreover, as in the case under instantaneous CSIT [5], once beyond 1/2 DoF per user (the time-sharing DoF) is achievable, so is 2/3 DoF per user. However, when there is no omniscient node in the network, unlike the case under instantaneous CSIT where either (1/2, 1) or (1, 1/2) DoF pair is achievable, there are examples where neither can be achieved while (2/3, 2/3) is achievable (e.g., the 2 × 2 × 2 network, the DoF region of which is completely characterized in [9] [10]).\nThe converse part of the result follows straightforwardly from that in the case with instantaneous CSIT: if there is an omniscient node in the network, even with instantaneous CSIT, sum DoF of greater than 1 is not achievable. Our main contribution lies in the achievability proof when there is no omniscient node, where we extend the scheme proposed in [6] [10] to exploit delayed CSIT in two unicast networks with arbitrary number of nodes and connectivity. Unlike in speciﬁc networks such as the two-user interference channel or the 2 × 2 × 2 network, the key idea in dealing with networks with general connectivity is to identify the special nodes that have to make carefully designed (linear) operations; these nodes are identiﬁed in a systematical way. To achieve 2/3 DoF per user, most nodes in the network can just perform oblivious random linear coding that does not require CSI, except for these special nodes which do the carefully designed linear operations to exploit delayed CSI.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the model of the network and the channel state information. Section III summarizes a few deﬁnitions and the main theorem. In Section IV, we demonstrate several key ideas through a motivating example. Then Section V is devoted to prove the achievability. Finally we conclude the paper with Section VI.\nA two-source-two-destination layered network G = (V, E) is a collection of nodes V that can be partitioned into L + 2 layers (L ≥ 0):\nsuch that for any edge (u, v) ∈ E, ∃ k, 0 ≤ k ≤ L s.t. u ∈ L k , v ∈ L k +1 . The ﬁrst layer L 0 = {s 1 , s 2 } consists of the two source nodes, and the last layer L L +1 = {d 1 , d 2 } consists of the two destination nodes. Without loss of generality we assume each node in the network can be reached by at least one of the source nodes and can reach at least one of the destination nodes. For each node v ∈ V \\ {s 1 , s 2 }, we deﬁne nodes that can reach v as its predecessors. Let P(v) denote the set of predecessors that can reach v in one step. We will call the nodes in P(v) as the parents of v.\nFor each edge (u, v) ∈ E, the associated channel gain at time t is given by h vu [t] ∈ R, t ≥ 0, where the channel gains are i.i.d. drawn from a continuous distribution, over time and E. Let X u [t], Y u [t] ∈ R denote the transmission and reception of node u respectively. The reception of a node is the superposition of the transmission of its parents along with an additive white Gaussian noise:\nwhere the noise Z u [t] ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) is i.i.d. over time and V. Each node has the same power constraint P .\nAt time t ≥ 1, a node w ∈ V has knowledge of the channel coefﬁcient associated to edge (u, v) ∈ E, h vu up to time (t −l), if the tail node of this edge, v, can reach w in l steps in the undirected version of G. Note under this CSI model, it remains that a receiver have instantaneous CSI associated to the edges connecting to it, while a transmitter only have unit-delayed CSI associated to the edges emanating from it. For example, in the network depicted in Fig. 1(a), at time t regarding the channel gain associated to the edge (u 2 , u 4 ), the source s 1 has its CSI up to time (t − 2), simply because the tail node u 4 can reach s 1 in two steps on the undirected version of G.\nWe are mainly interested in the high-SNR approximate capacity region, namely, the collection of achievable degrees of freedom (DoF). For user i, i = 1, 2, its achievable DoF is deﬁned as d i := lim P →∞ \t R i 1\n, where (R 1 , R 2 ) lies in the capacity region of the two unicast network.\nTo present our main result, we begin with a few deﬁnitions, followed by an example network illustrating the deﬁnitions.\nDeﬁnition 1 (Critical Nodes): For each i = 1, 2, we deﬁne the critical node v ∗ i as any node with the smallest layer index\nsuch that the removal of {v ∗ i } separates d i from {s 1 , s 2 }. We use L k ∗ i to denote the layer where critical nodes v ∗ i lies.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Cloud): Deﬁne the cloud C i , for i = 1, 2, to be the set of nodes that can be reached by v ∗ i and that can reach d i . All nodes in the cloud receive functions of the reception of the critical node and the additive noise terms at their predecessors in the cloud.\nDeﬁnition 3: A node is s i -reachable if it can be reached by s i . It is s i -only-reachable if it can be reached by s i but not s j , j = i. It is s 1 s 2 -reachable if it can be reached by both s 1 and s 2 . For each node v ∈ V \\ {s 1 , s 2 }, for i = 1, 2, let P s i (v) ⊆ P(v) denote the set of parents of v that are s i - reachable , and we deﬁne for i = 1, 2,\n(1) Note that only accounting the contribution from source s i , the reception of v and a node in u ∈ K s i (v) are just a scaled version of each other, i.e., they are s i -clones.\nDeﬁnition 4 (Omniscient Node): We say a node v ∈ V is omniscient if it satisﬁes either of (A) or (B) below:\n(A) The removal of {v} separates d 1 from {s 1 , s 2 } and the removal of K s 2 (v) separates d 2 from s 2 .\nTo illustrate the above deﬁnitions, let us consider the network illustrated in Fig. 1(a) which consists of ﬁve layers: L 0 , L 1 , . . . , L 4 . The second layer L 1 consists of three nodes {u 1 , u 2 , u 3 }. u 1 is s 1 -only-reachable, u 2 is s 2 -only-reachable, while u 3 is s 1 s 2 -reachable. It is straightforward to see that the removal of u 3 separates d 2 from {s 1 , s 2 } and it is the earliest (in terms of layer indices), i.e., u 3 is the critical node for user 2.\nSimilarly, the node u 4 is the critical node for user 1. The cloud C 1 = {u 6 , u 7 }, the reception of which is (roughly) determined by the critical node u 3 . Similarly the cloud C 2 = {u 5 , u 8 , u 9 }.\nThe nodes u 1 and u 3 share the same s 1 -reachable parent which is s 1 . Hence, we see that from (1) the s 1 -clone of u 3 : K s 1 (u 3 ) = {u 1 , u 3 }. Now from Fig. 1(b), we see that the removal of K s 1 (u 3 ) separates d 1 from s 1 . Hence, u 3 is omniscient since it satisﬁes Condition (B) of Deﬁnition 4.\nNext we shall argue intuitively that for any working system on this network, u 3 can decode both users\u2019 messages, implying that the sum DoF is at most 1. To see this, we argue ﬁrst by ignoring the noise. In a working system, since u 3 is a critical node for user 2, it can decode user 2\u2019s message; hence transmission from s 2 . Since the received signal of u 3 is the sum of the transmitted signals from s 1 and s 2 , it therefore knows the transmission from s 1 and the the reception of u 1 . Therefore in any working system, d 2 -critical node u 3 knows the transmission from source s 2 and K s 1 (u 3 ) = {u 1 , u 3 }. Finally, the reception of d 1 is determined by the transmissions from K s 1 (u 3 ) and s 2 , and hence in a working system, u 3 can decode user 1\u2019s message as well.\nTheorem 1: Under delayed CSIT model, if there is no omniscient node in the network, then the DoF region contains the kite region\nConversely, if there is an omniscient node in the network, then the DoF region is the triangular region\nRemark: There is an example (the 2 × 2 × 2 interference network) where the DoF region is exactly the kite K.\nThe converse part of Theorem 1 follows from the instanta- neous CSIT result and hence is omitted here. It can be found in the appendix of the extended version of this paper [11]. In the rest of the paper we focus on the proof of the direct part.\nBefore we go into details of the proof, in this section we ﬁrst present some key intuitions behind the achievability proof via a special case where one of the two users does not experience interference. We illustrate how to identify and code at special nodes of the network. One such special nodes are the critical nodes (see Deﬁnition 1) which (roughly) determine the reception of their respective destinations, i.e., should be able to decode the desired messages. Moreover, the critical nodes naturally break the overall networks into several effective stages, which play a key role in the scheme.\nConsider the special networks where d 1 can only be reached by s 1 and hence only user 2 is interfered. The critical node for user 1 is s 1 . The assumption of the non-existence of omniscient node then implies that the critical node for user 2 must lie in a layer with index strictly larger than 1. Therefore we have k ∗ 1 = 0, k ∗ 2 ≥ 2 (see Deﬁnition 1) as illustrated in Fig. 2.\nFirst, s 1 can reach the critical node v ∗ 2 since k ∗ 2 = 0. Second, note that in layer L k ∗\n, the layer that user 2\u2019s critical node belongs to, only the critical node v ∗ 2 can reach d 2 due to its deﬁnition. Therefore other nodes in L k ∗ 2 belong to cloud C 1 . Beside, since v ∗ 2 is not omniscient but its removal will separate d 2 from {s 1 , s 2 }, the removal of its s 1 -clones, K s 1 (v ∗ 2 ), cannot separate d 1 from s 1 . Therefore, there exists a node w ∈ L k ∗ 2 that can reach d 1 , such that\nNow, if instantaneous CSIT is available, the parents of w and v ∗ 2 can choose their transmission according to the channel gains that they are faced with so that interference is com- pletely cancelled \u201cover-the-air\u201d at w and v ∗ 2 [5]. Without the knowledge of these channel coefﬁcients beforehand, however, such cancellation seems impossible.\nUnder delayed CSIT, we shall prove that (d 1 , d 2 ) = (1, 1/2) is always achievable. Our scheme is linear in the sense that every node transmits a linear transformation of its reception. Since the performance measure of interest is DoF, in the rest of the paper we neglect the additive noise terms and focus on the linear combinations that nodes receive and transmit. The goal is to deliver a block (length 2) of two symbols {a 1 , a 2 } from s 1 to d 1 and a block of one symbol {b} from s 2 to d 2 over two time slots. Our scheme breaks the layered network into several stages, each of which consists of several consecutive layers. When we describe the scheme in the following, we focus on how transmitted signals in each stage are formed according to the reception from the previous stage. Moreover, some special nodes that exploit delayed transmitter CSI have to wait until the relevant CSI is gathered. Therefore, the time index t in the following does not refer to \u201cabsolute time\u201d but the \u201corder index\u201d of the transmitted signal associated to each block of symbols. Different blocks will be pipelined in a standard way.\nLet us describe the scheme for the stage from Layer L 0 to L (k ∗ 2 −1) and the stage from L (k ∗ 2 −1) to L k ∗ 2 , and show that DoF (d 1 , d 2 ) = (1, 1/2) is achievable.\n−1) , Time t = 1, 2: At each of the two time slots, each node in this stage (excluding L (k ∗ 2 −1) ) transmits a randomly chosen linear transformation of its reception at that time slot, with s 1 sending {a 1 , a 2 } and s 2 sending {b, b} at time t = 1 and t = 2 respectively.\n−1) to L k ∗ 2 , Time t = 1: Each node in layer L (k ∗\n−1) transmits a randomly chosen linear transforma- tion of its receptions over time slots t = 1 and t = 2. A node\na 2 and B 2 = g v ∗ 2 s 2 b. Note that g v ∗ 2 s 2 = 0 with high probability since s 2 can reach v ∗ 2 .\nSince v ∗ 2 is not omniscient, in layer L k ∗ 2 there exists a node w ∈ C 1 such that in its received signal Y w [1] = A w =\n, the column vector G ws 1 is not aligned to G v ∗ 2 s 1 with high probability. This is because either\nIn both cases, due to the independent random mixing at the parent nodes as well as the i.i.d. fading channel gains, the above claim follows straightforwardly as in the case with instantaneous CSIT [4] [5].\n−1) to L k ∗ 2 , Time t = 2: Each s 2 - only-reachable node in layer L (k ∗\n−1) transmits a randomly chosen scaled copy of b. Each s 1 -reachable node in L (k ∗\nthat cannot reach v ∗ 2 transmits a randomly chosen linear transformation of its receptions over time slots t = 1 and t = 2, as in Phase 2.\nOn the other hand, the s 1 -reachable parents of v ∗ 2 are those have to take care in forming their transmit linear combinations. Each of them, say, u, will combine its received linear combi- nations over the time slots t = 1, 2 so that in the combination, the contribution from source s 1 is equal to A 2 . Mathematically, if A 2 = G T v ∗\na 2 , then u will combine Y u [1] = g us 1 [1]a 1 + g us 2 [1]b and Y u [2] = g us 1 [2]a 2 + g us 2 [2]b in the following way:\nThis operation is feasible under the CSI model, since the effective channel gains g (1) v ∗\n(which determine the linear combination A 2 ) only contain past channel coefﬁcients, and this knowledge is known to the s 1 -reachable parents of v ∗ 2 at this point.\nThe received signal of v ∗ 2 at time t = 2 becomes a linear combination of A 2 and b, and due to the i.i.d. fading channel gains, this linear combination is not aligned to A 2 + B 2 with high probability. Hence v ∗ 2 can decode b. Then within the cloud C 2 , v ∗ 2 can deliver b to d 2 by routing.\nAs for destination d 1 , it relies on the node w to deliver the two symbols {a 1 , a 2 }. Note that w at time t = 2 receives a scaled version of A 2 plus some other randomly formed linear combination of {a 1 , a 2 } if w has an s 1 -reachable parent that\ncannot reach v ∗ 2 . Therefore, its received linear combination of {a 1 , a 2 } at time t = 2 is not aligned to A w with high probability, as A 2 is not. Combining this linear combination with its received signal at time t = 1, A w , it can decode {a 1 , a 2 }. Hence, d 1 can receive {a 1 , a 2 } from w.\nLet us summarize the key elements that we develop through- out this motivating example:\n\u2022 Critical nodes serve as \u201canchors\u201d in the scheme. The two sources 2 , parents of critical nodes, and critical nodes are the places where delayed transmitter CSI is exploited.\n\u2022 Other nodes in the network simply perform random linear coding in any phases of the scheme.\n\u2022 Absence of omniscient nodes guarantees the richness of received linear combinations and is the key to the proof.\nWithout loss of generality, let us assume that k ∗ 1 ≤ k ∗ 2 , that is, the critical node for user 1 lies in a layer with index smaller than that for user 2. Note that if k ∗ i = 1, then the critical node v ∗ i becomes omniscient, violating the assumption. Hence in the following we consider the case k ∗ i = 1, for i = 1, 2. Moreover, if k ∗ 1 = 0, it means that d 1 is s 1 -only- reachable. If k ∗ 2 = 0 too, then d 2 is also s 2 -only-reachable, and the two users do not interfere with each other. Hence DoF (d 1 , d 2 ) = (1, 1) is achievable without CSIT by routing. Also, in Section IV we have already shown that (1, 1/2) is achievable when k ∗ 1 = 0 and k ∗ 2 ≥ 2. Hence, (2/3, 2/3) can be achieved by time-sharing between (1, 1/2) and (0, 1).\nWhat remains to be dealt with is the case 2 ≤ k ∗ 1 ≤ k ∗ 2 . Our scheme ensures that v ∗ i can decode what d i aims to decode, i = 1, 2. We focus on linear schemes. The goal is to deliver a block of two symbols {a 1 , a 2 } from s 1 to d 1 and a block of two symbols {b 1 , b 2 } from s 2 to d 2 over three time slots. Our scheme breaks the layered network into several stages, each of which consists of several consecutive layers.\nFirst we need to make sure that symbols {a 1 , a 2 } can be retrieved by the critical node v ∗ 1 , which can be reached by both sources. Let us begin by describing the scheme for the stage from Layer L 0 to L (k ∗\n−1) and the stage from L (k ∗ 1 −1) to L k ∗ 1 . Phase 1: Stage L 0 to L (k ∗\n−1) , Time t = 1, 2: At each of the two time slots, each node in this stage (excluding L (k ∗ 1 −1) ) transmits a randomly chosen linear transformation of its reception at that time slot, with s 1 sending {a 1 , a 2 } and s 2 sending {b 1 , b 2 } at time t = 1 and t = 2 respectively.\n−1) to L k ∗ 1 , Time t = 1: Each node in layer L (k ∗\n−1) transmits a randomly chosen linear transforma- tion of its receptions over time slots t = 1 and t = 2.\nb 2 . Since v ∗ 1 is not omniscient, there exists a node v ∈ L k ∗\nb 2 , the column vector G vs 2 is not aligned to G v ∗ 1 s 2 with high probability.\n−1) , Time t = 3: Each node in this stage (excluding L (k ∗\n−1) ) transmits a randomly chosen linear transformation of its reception at time slot t = 3, with s 1 sending some linear combination of {a 1 , a 2 }, A (which is not aligned to A 1 ), and s 2 sending B 1 respectively.\n−1) to L k ∗ 1 , Time t = 2, 3: At each of the two time slots, each node in layer L (k ∗\n−1) transmits a randomly chosen linear transformation of its reception at time slot t = 3. The received signals of v ∗ 1 at time t = 2 and t = 3 are\nThe two linear combinations of {A, B 1 } are linearly inde- pendent with high probability. Hence v ∗ 1 can decode {A, B 1 }. Combined with Y v ∗\n[1] = A 1 + B 1 , v ∗ 1 can decode A 1 and hence {a 1 , a 2 }.\nSo far we have designed the scheme so that v ∗ 1 is able to decode {a 1 , a 2 } over three time slots. Next, the scheme in the later stages has to guarantee that\ni) Symbols {a 1 , a 2 } can be delivered to d 1 from v ∗ 1 , and ii) v ∗ 2 can decode {b 1 , b 2 }\nIn this case, the two critical nodes v ∗ 1 and v ∗ 2 are in the same layer L k ∗ . Due to the deﬁnition of critical nodes, we can conclude that L k ∗ = {v ∗ 1 , v ∗ 2 }, that is, only these two nodes are in layer L k ∗ .\nTherefore, the node v described in the above scheme must be v ∗ 2 . Denote the received signal at time t = 1, Y v ∗ 2 [1], by\nSince v ∗ 1 is not omniscient, the two column vectors G v ∗ 1 s 2 and G v ∗ 2 s 2 are not aligned with high probability. Similarly, since v ∗ 2 is not omniscient, the two column vectors G v ∗ 1 s 1 and\nWe choose the transmitted linear combination of s 1 at time t = 3, A, to be A 2 . Similar to the reasoning why v ∗ 1 can decode {a 1 , a 2 }, v ∗ 2 can decode {b 1 , b 2 }, by ﬁrst decoding {A 2 , B 1 } and then combining with Y v ∗\nIn layer L k ∗ 1 , v ∗ 1 is able to decode {a 1 , a 2 , B 1 } due to the chosen scheme. If v ∗ 1 cannot reach v ∗ 2 , then inside the cloud C 1 , we can deliver {a 1 , a 2 } to d 1 without affecting the reception of v ∗ 2 . If v ∗ 1 can reach v ∗ 2 , then the operation has to be more careful. Hence, we shall distinguish further into two cases: a) v ∗ 1 can reach v ∗ 2 , and b) v ∗ 1 cannot reach v ∗ 2 . In the latter case, a more detailed discussion is required. Due to space constraint, we leave it in the extended version of this paper [11]. Below we focus on the case when v ∗ 1 can reach v ∗ 2 .\nIn this case all nodes in L k ∗ 1 keep silent except v ∗ 1 and v. Note that the node v can decode B 1 . The important thing is, B 1 and B v (the contribution from s 2 at time t = 1) are not aligned. We shall make use of v ∗ 1 as the source of providing {a 1 , a 2 } and v as the source of providing {b 1 , b 2 }. During the ﬁrst time slot, we shut user 1 off, that is, keep v ∗ 1 silent, and let v deliver B 1 to d 2 by routing. During the second and the third time slots, we mimic the (1, 1/2)-achievability scheme in the case k ∗ 1 = 0, k ∗ 2 ≥ 2 in Section IV to deliver symbols {a 1 , a 2 } to d 1 and B v to d 2 . v ∗ 1 takes the role of s 1 , and v takes the role of s 2 . The only difference is that, v may not be able to decode {b 1 , b 2 }. As an alternative, during Phase 1 of the scheme (described in Section IV) it sends out A v + B v . Note that now in Phase 2, the linear combination A 2 will contain the contribution from A v , but it is still a linear combination of {a 1 , a 2 }. The rest of the scheme remains the same, and at the end of the three phases, d 2 can decode B v . In summary, at the end of the three time slots, d 1 obtains {a 1 , a 2 } and d 2 obtains {B 1 , B v } and hence {b 1 , b 2 }.\nThough absence of an omniscient node enables performance better than time-sharing, we still do not have a conclusive DoF characterization of arbitrary two-unicast networks with delayed CSIT. This is part of an ongoing study, where we are exploring better outer bounds as well as new coding ideas."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A. S. Avestimehr"},{"name":"S. N. Diggavi"},{"name":"D. N. C.
