For channels with memory, however, feedback may increase the capacity.\nOne of the ﬁrst results on the capacity of channels with memory and feedback was by Viswanathan [2], who studied the capacity of a ﬁnite-state channel (FSC) with receiver channel-state information (CSI) and delayed feedback in the absence of inter-symbol interference (ISI). Later, Chen and Berger [3] derived the capacity of a FSC with ISI where current (i.e., not delayed) CSI is available at the transmitter and the receiver. Yang et. al. [4] used a stochastic control methodology to ﬁnd the capacity of the ISI channel (where the evolution of the state is deterministic). In a related line of work, the authors of [5], [6] derived a single-letter ex- pression for the class of uniﬁlar channels and used dynamic programming to evaluate analytically the channel capacity for the trapdoor and the Ising channels with feedback. Recently, Tatikonda and Mitter [7] provided a general stochastic con- trol framework for evaluating the capacity of the FSC with feedback. In that work, the capacity was characterized as the solution of a dynamic programming average reward optimality equation (AROE). Como et. al. [8] used an approach similar to that in [7] to ﬁnd the capacity of the FSC when current CSI is available at the transmitter and the receiver. An upper bound on the capacity of the FSC without ISI and CSI was found using dynamic programming by Huang et. al. [9].\nA signiﬁcant amount of research has also been done in the area of code design for channels with memory. Horstein [10]\nproposed a simple sequential transmission scheme for the binary symmetric channel (BSC) which is capacity-achieving and provides a larger error exponent than traditional ﬁxed- length block-coding. Similarly, Schalkwijk and Kailath [11] showed that capacity and a double exponentially decreasing error probability can be achieved by a simple sequential transmission scheme for the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGNC) with average power constraint. Recently, Shayevitz and Feder [12]\u2013[14] identiﬁed an underlying prin- ciple shared by the aforementioned Horstein and Schalkwijk- Kailath schemes and introduced a simple encoding scheme, namely the posterior matching scheme (PMS) for general memoryless channels. Furthermore, they showed that the PMS achieves the capacity of general discrete memoryless channels (DMCs). Subsequently, Coleman [15] revisited the PMS and reformulated the problem in a stochastic control framework. In [16], [17] the authors proposed a PMS scheme for channels with memory and state and output feedback.\nIn this paper, we investigate potentially capacity-achieving transmission schemes for a special class of ﬁnite-state channels (FSC), namely uniﬁlar FSCs, where the channel state at time t + 1 is a deterministic function of the current state input and output. Based on the derived capacity expression, and the structure of the capacity-achieving input distribution derived in [5], we propose a PMS-like sequential transmission scheme. Intuitively, the transmitter and receiver both update a \u201cstate\u201d which includes the a-posteriori distribution of the transmitted message conditioned on the observation output for all current states. At the same time, the transmitter is sending the most informative input symbol in such a way that the state-conditioned input distribution is the one implied by the capacity expression. Due to the presence of ISI, the proposed scheme has a number of unique characteristics that were not present in the PMS proposed for memoryless channels. Regarding the methodology followed for proving zero rate achievability, we generalize the tools utilized in [14], [16], [17].\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the channel model and some preliminaries are in- troduced. The generalized PMS is presented in Section III and\nsome important properties are developed in IV. In Section V, the proof of zero-rate achievability is presented. Section VI concludes the paper.\nWe consider channels with input, output and state random processes denoted by (X t ) ∞ t=1 , (Y t ) ∞ t=1 , (S t ) ∞ t=1 , respectively. The corresponding input, output and state alphabets are ﬁnite and denoted by X , Y, and S, respectively. For reasons that will become clear in the following we also assume that X = {0, 1, . . . , |X | − 1}. At time t the receiver has access to the current channel output Y t , which is also fed back to the transmitter with unit delay. The state transition and the channel output are deﬁned as\nfor a given stochastic kernel Q ∈ X × S → P(Y) and a deterministic function g ∈ S × X × Y → S, where we denote by P(A) the set of distributions on A. These channels are referred to as uniﬁlar ﬁnite-state channels (FSCs) [5], [6].\nIn [5] the authors formulated the problem of ﬁnding the capacity of uniﬁlar FSCs with unit-delayed output feedback as a stochastic control problem. The basic idea was to deﬁne a controlled Markov process with state B t ∈ P(S) deﬁned as\nTheir results (although not presented in this form) imply that under mild conditions the capacity of uniﬁlar FSCs can be put in a single-letter expression of the form\nwhere the mutual information in (3) is evaluated with the joint distribution\nwhere P (B t −1 ) is the steady-state distribution of the induced Markov process (B t ) t deﬁned by the conditional distribution\nand θ is given by the recursive updating of B t = θ(B t −1 , Y t ) as shown in (6). We note that the above expressions can also be derived from the general framework developed in [7] as a special case. It was further shown in [5] that the capacity expression can, be evaluated as the solution of an appropriate average reward optimality equation (AROE) [18]. For the spe- cial case of the trapdoor and the Ising channels with feedback the authors provided analytical solutions to the AROE in [5], [6].\nIn this section we describe a sequential transmission scheme for the uniﬁlar FSC with unit-delay output feed- back. We assume that the capacity achieving distributions (P (X t |S t , B t −1 )) S t ,B t −1 have been found for all values of (S t , B t −1 ) ∈ S × P(S). We consider transmission of a message W ∈ [0, 1). Let F be the set of all valid cdfs over [0, 1) and deﬁne the random variable F \u2032 t ∈ S → F as\nWith the above deﬁnition, F \u2032 t ( ·|s) is the a-posteriori cdf of W conditioned on S t+1 = s, Y t , and F \u2032 t is the collection of all these conditional cdfs for all s ∈ S. In the following we will also use the notation F \u2032 t (w) def = (F \u2032 t (w |s)) s ∈S , as well as the notation F \u2032 t (s) def = F \u2032 t ( ·|s); the distinction should be obvious from the context.\nwhere the inverse cdf is deﬁned as F −1 P (y) def = inf {x : F P (x) ≥ y } and F P denotes the cdf corresponding to a random variable with distribution P . The initial posterior cdfs are set to be uniform, i.e., F \u2032 0 (w |s) = w for w ∈ [0, 1). This transmis- sion scheme is similar to the PMS scheme proposed for DMCs in [14] with the following differences. First, the input signal X t is matched to the capacity achieving distribution P (X t |S t , B t −1 ) which is not constant, but changes depending on the current values of the quantities S t , B t −1 . Second, the encoding scheme is a function of the message W through the value F \u2032 t (W |S t ) and thus an appropriate \u201cstate\u201d for the trans- mitter involves the entire vector F \u2032 t (W ) = (F \u2032 t (W |s)) s ∈S . Third, the additional \u201cstate\u201d variable B t can be recursively updated through the update equation B t = θ(B t −1 , Y t ) as shown in (6), and the current state S t is available at the transmitter at time t due to the uniﬁlar property, i.e., S t = g(S t −1 , X t −1 , Y t −1 ) = ˜ g(X t −1 , Y t −1 ) 1 . The proposed transmission scheme is also similar to the one in [16] and [17, ch. 5] for ISI FSCs with the difference being that in the above references the channel is not necessarily uniﬁlar, and CSI is available at the receiver and with unit delay at the transmitter. We now show that the quantity F \u2032 t can also be evaluated recursively at the transmitter. Indeed, the corresponding pdf can be updated as shown in (9) with P (Y t |B t −1 ) derived from the joint distribution in (4). Integrating out (9) results in an explicit recursion for the cdfs F \u2032 t . We will use the shorthand notation\nfor the above update. It can be shown from (9) that F \u2032 t (w) is a function of F \u2032 t −1 only through F \u2032 t −1 (w). This has im- portant implications for the analysis of the PMS scheme.\nIn the following we will also use the notation F \u2032 t (w) = ϕ(F \u2032 t −1 , B t −1 , Y t )(w) = ϕ(F \u2032 t −1 (w), B t −1 , Y t ).\nAt the receiver, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is performed based on the posterior distribution of the message W conditioned on the observations Y t . Let the corresponding posterior cdf be F t ∈ F with F t (w) = P (W ≤ w|Y t ). It is straightforward to show that\nwhich together with ϕ and θ results in F t = ψ(F \u2032 t −1 , B t −1 , Y t ) and moreover in F t (w) = ψ(F \u2032 t −1 (w), B t −1 , Y t ). In view of the above recursions, as well as the recursions (6) and (9) for B t and F \u2032 t , respectively, it is clear that the receiver can also evaluate the posterior cdf F t recursively. Finally, the message estimate is obtained as\nThe following properties are now established for the de- scribed transmission scheme.\nLemma 1. For the transmission scheme described above and for every t ≥ 1 we have\n1) The random variables F \u2032 t (W |S t+1 ) and F t (W ) are uni- formly distributed in [0, 1).\nProof: First note that repeated application of the recur- sions g, θ, and ϕ imply that S t+1 = ˜ g(X t , Y t ) = ˆ g(W, Y t ), B t = ˆ θ(Y t ) and F \u2032 t = ˆ ϕ(Y t ).\nP (F \u2032 t (W |S t+1 ) ≤ a) \t (16a) =\nwhere f \u2032 t is the cdf corresponding to the realization y t . Similarly for F t (W ).\nwhere (17a) is due to the fact that B t −1 and F \u2032 t −1 can be recovered from Y t −1 using ˆ θ and ˆ ϕ; (17c) is due to the transmission scheme in (8) and the deﬁnition of F \u2032 t in (7); and (17e) is due to the posterior matching in (8). Similarly for the third property.\nWe now show that the proposed transmission scheme sat- isﬁes a necessary condition for capacity achievability. For transmission at rate R over a period of n channel uses we have\nwhere (19c) is due to (15) and the fact that X t is implicitly only a function of W and Y t −1 , S t can be derived from X t −1 and Y t −1 through ˆ g and B t −1 is a function of Y t −1 through ˆ θ; and (19d) is due to the channel statistics and the fact that B t −1 is independent of Y t conditioned on X t and S t .\nLet ˆ W t be the message point estimate at the receiver at time t. Then, a transmission scheme achieves rate R if\nIn particular, we say that a transmission schemes achieves zero rate if\nThe subsequent analysis is valid for a (broad) class of non- pathological channels, namely ﬁxed-point free channels, that are deﬁned in a way similar to [14], [17].\nDeﬁnition 1. A channel is called ﬁxed-point free if for any a = (a(s)) s ∈S ∈ (0, 1) |S| , b ∈ P(S)\nThe above deﬁnition essentially implies that the recursions θ, ϕ do not have a ﬁxed point with respect to the posterior cdf F t that they imply. Finally, assuming that the probabilities Q(y |x, s) and the capacity achieving distribution P (x|s, b) are non-zero for all x, y, s, b, the recursions in (9) and (6) guarantee that for every realization of the random variables of interest, F \u2032 t will always have a pdf; in addition the pdf will be non-zero everywhere in (0, 1] 2 .\nwhere λ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is onto, strictly concave and symmetric about 0.5. This deﬁnition implies that λ(x) equals 0 at x = 0, 1 and equals 1 at x = 1/2. Furthermore, V λ (F ) is small if F resembles a step function (it is exactly 0 for a step function). A function ξ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is called a contraction if it is nonnegative, concave, and ξ(x) < x for x ∈ (0, 1). The following lemma shows that the probability of having an F t that does not resemble a step function is zero at the limit of large t.\nLemma 2. If the channel is ﬁxed-point free, then for ϵ > 0 and for all f \u2032 ∈ F |S| ,\nProof: We would like to ﬁnd a contraction mapping ξ such that for every w, b t −1 , f \u2032 t −1 we have\nf \u2032 t −1 (s)b t −1 (s). Let us assume for now that such a contraction mapping exists. Then, for any f \u2032 ∈ F |S|\n= E[E[V λ (F t ) |Y t −1 , F \u2032 0 = f \u2032 ] |F \u2032 0 = f \u2032 ]/ϵ \t (26b) = E[E[V λ (ψ(F \u2032 t −1 , B t −1 , Y t )) |B t −1 , F \u2032 t −1 ] |F \u2032 0 = f \u2032 ]/ϵ\n(26c) = E[E[V λ (F t ) |B t −1 , F \u2032 t −1 ] |F \u2032 0 = f \u2032 ]/ϵ \t (26d)\n= f \u2032 ]/ϵ (26e) ≤ E[\nξ(λ(F t −1 (w)))dw |F \u2032 0 = f \u2032 ]/ϵ \t (26f) ≤ ξ(E[V λ (F t −1 ) |F \u2032 0 = f \u2032 ])/ϵ \t (26g)\nwhere the ﬁrst inequality is the Markov inequality, the second inequality is due to the assumption for the property of ξ, the third inequality is due to the concavity of ξ, the fourth inequal- ity is due to repeated application of the above inequalities, and the (uniform) convergence to 0 is due to the property of the contraction [14, Lemma 8].\nIt remains to ﬁnd the contraction ξ with the aforementioned property. To this end let λ \u2032 : [0, 0.5] → [0, 1] be a restriction of λ on [0, 0.5]. Then, λ \u2032 becomes one-to-one and onto, hence it has inverse. Let ˜ ξ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] be deﬁned as\nwhere the supremum is over b, x \u2032 = (x \u2032 (s)) s ∈S with x \u2032 (s) ≥ 0,\nof a continuous function over a compact space and thus it is achieved. Consider now the following function\nClearly, ξ ∗ (x) ≥ 0. We will now show that ξ ∗ satisﬁes the aforementioned property. Indeed, let a def = f t −1 (w). If a ∈ [0, 1/2] then λ \u2032−1 (λ(a)) = a and the ﬁrst term in the maximization on the r.h.s. of (28) (for x = λ(a)) equals ˜ ξ(a). If a ∈ [1/2, 1] then 1 − λ \u2032−1 (λ(a)) = a and the second term in the maximization of the r.h.s. of (28) (for x = λ(a)) equals ˜ ξ(a). Thus, ξ ∗ (λ(a)) ≥ ˜ξ(a) ≥ E[λ(ψ(f \u2032 t −1 (w), b t −1 , Y t )) |b t −1 , f \u2032 t −1 ].\nThe remaining of the proof is similar to the one developed for DMC\u2019s in [14] and will not be repeated here.\nThe above result can be used to show that rate R = 0 is achievable.\nProposition 1. If the channel is ﬁxed-point free, then for ϵ, δ > 0\nProof: The proof is exactly the same as in the DMC case and can be found in [17, Appendix A].\nFollowing similar steps as the ones followed [17] to show capacity achievability for the PMS scheme for ﬁnite state channels with both output and state feedback, one may now prove achievability for any rate up to capacity. An alternative proof of achievability may be pursued based on the ideas of stochastic nonlinear ﬁlter stability described in [19]. In the following we state the achievability of R < C as a conjecture.\nStarting from a single-letter capacity expression for uniﬁlar FSC with output feedback, we propose a sequential trans- mission scheme that is inspired by the PMS developed for memoryless channels and FSC with output and state feedback. The proposed scheme is shown to be have a recursive structure and it possesses the properties that every PMS scheme should possess. The proposed scheme is shown to achieve zero rate for the aforementioned channels by extending the achievability proof developed for memoryless channels. An interesting future research direction is the analysis of the error probability of this (and other) PMS schemes and in particular the error exponent analysis. In addition, an alternative uniﬁed proof of the achievability of PMS-like schemes may be pursued based\non the ideas of stochastic nonlinear ﬁlter stability described in [19]."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
