The terminals are observing the outputs of correlated sources and want to generate a common secret. This setting forms the foundation of template-protection systems, e.g. the fuzzy commitment system proposed by Juels and Wat- tenberg [11]. We have the objective here to analyze secret-key generation in an authentication setting, i.e., we are interested in ﬁnding out what false-acceptance rate can by achieved by an imposter that has access to the exchanged message. The Ahlswede-Csiszar model was studied by the authors in [9] to determine the trade-off between the secret-key rate and the amount of information that the exchanged message leaks about biometric sequence (privacy leakage). We will extend this trade-off to authentication here.\nThe symbols of the enrollment and legitimate authentication biometric sequences assume values in the ﬁnite alphabets X and Y, respectively. The joint probability of the length-N sequences x N and y N is given by\nfor all x N ∈ X N , x N ∈ Y N . Here {Q(x, y), x ∈ X , y ∈ Y} is a probability distribution, and the pairs (X n , Y n ) for n = 1, 2, · · · , N are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\nAlso the symbols of the impostor sequences z N assume values in the alphabet Y.\nFirst we consider basic authentication, see Fig. 1. During enrollment a person presents his biometric. The corresponding biometric sequence X N is observed and sent to an au- thenticator. Later, when the legitimate person wants to get\n- -\n- -\nauthenticated, he presents his (legitimate) sequence Y N to the authenticator. Also an impostor can try to get positively authenticated. To accomplish this, he has to present a sequence Z N to the authenticator, that results into a positive authenti- cation decision. Thus, we assume here that the impostor can perform an active attack (i.e. inject some sequence) only before authentication point (or matching point), see Ratha et. al [13], by trying to make use of the operational vulnerability of a system.\nThe authenticator uses a set B(XY ) ∈ X N × Y N and positively authenticates y N if pairs (x N , y N ) ∈ B(XY ) and rejects y N when (x N , y N ) / ∈ B(XY ). We denote B(X|y N ) ∆ = {x N : (x N , y N ) ∈ B(XY )}. The false-rejection rate FRR and maximum false-acceptance rate mFAR are now deﬁned as\nThe system should be designed such that the FRR is negligible and the mFAR is exponentially as small as possible.\nDeﬁnition 1: We say that false-acceptance exponent E is achievable in the basic authentication scenario, if for all δ > 0, there exist, for all N large enough, authenticators that achieve\nTheorem 1: False-acceptance exponents E ≤ I(X; Y ) are achievable, and therefore I(X; Y ) is the fundamental limit in the basic authentication scenario.\n(a) First we prove the converse. Consider an authentication set B(XY ). Assume that B = 1 if (X N , Y N ) ∈ B(XY ) and B = 0 otherwise. Now let FRR = (x N ,y N ) / ∈B(XY ) P (x N , y N ) ≤ δ, then\n(b) The achievability follows from weak typicality, ﬁxing an N and an ε > 0, and taking B(XY ) = A N ε (XY ). Now FRR ≤ ε for N → ∞. The mFAR can be upper-bounded as\nN )P (y N ) P (x N , y N )\nThe achievability follows since for every ε > 0 we can let N → ∞.\nThe result that we have obtained is not a surprise consider- ing Stein\u2019s lemma, see Csiszar and Korner [5].\nThe major disadvantage of this basic authentication system is that the enrollment sequence has to be communicated to and stored securely at the authenticator. Otherwise, an impostor can gain access to X N and then get positively authenticated easily. To prevent this, the enrollment sequence X N has to be encrypted for storage and communication and decrypted for authentication, since the authenticator needs the original X N . All this requires the use of an extra key management mechanisms.\nIn a rate-constrained authentication scenario, see Fig. 2, the legitimate person presents his biometric sequence X N ﬁrst to\n- -\nan encoder that sends an index F ∈ F = {1, 2, · · · , |F |} to the authenticator. We write F = e(X N ). It is the objective in this rate-constrained setting to constrain the storage rate (1/N ) log 2 |F |, and study the effect of this constraint on the exponential behavior of the mFAR given that the FRR is negligible.\nThe authenticator now uses a set B(F Y ) ∈ F × Y N and positively authenticates y N if pairs (F, y N ) ∈ B(F Y ) and rejects y N if (F, y N ) / ∈ B(F Y ). Again we denote B(F |y N ) ∆ = {f : (f, y N ) ∈ B(F Y )}. The false-rejection rate FRR and maximum false-acceptance rate mFAR are now deﬁned as\nDeﬁnition 2: False-acceptance exponent and storage-rate combination (E, R) is achievable in the rate-constrained au- thentication scenario, if for all δ > 0, there exist for all N large enough encoders and authenticators that achieve\n1 N\nTheorem 2: . Exponent-rate combinations (E, R) are achievable in the rate-constrained authentication scenario if (E, R) ∈ RER, where\nProof: (a) In the achievability part we transform N copies of the source (X, Y ) into a source (F, Y N ) with (roughly) H(Y N |F ) ≤ N H(Y |U ) and F ∈ {1, 2, · · · , |F |} with\n|F | ≈ 2 N I(U ;X) , hence F is a quantized version of X N , see Ahlswede and Korner [3]. On this new source we apply the achievability part of basic Thm. 1. (b) The converse part is an extension of the converse of the basic theorem.\nThe advantage of constraining the storage rate is that we have to transmit, store, and encrypt/decrypt less data than in the basic setting. Note that taking U ≡ X results in\nE = I(X; Y ) and R = H(X), which is the result for the basic setting. Again, just like in the basic setting, F has to be encrypted and decrypted.\nNote that our Thm. 2 is similar to but yet different from the result on one-sided rate constrained hypothesis testing in [1].\nThe scenario for secret-based authentication will be de- scribed next. During enrollment a person presents his bio- metric sequence X N to an encoder. From this enrollment sequence X N a secret S is generated. This secret is made available at some later time to the authenticator, which is just an equality-checker here, see Fig.3. The encoder also produces a helper message M that is stored in a public database. To get authenticated the legitimate person presents his authentication sequence Y N to a decoder. The decoder produces an estimated secret S y using the helper message M , that it can retrieve from the public database. Also an impostor can try to get positively authenticated. An impostor who has access to the helper message M too, can present an impostor sequence Z N (M ) to the decoder that now forms estimated secret S z using M . The equality-checker compares the estimated secret S y or S z to the enrolled secret S, and positively authenticates a person if the secrets are equal and rejects a person, otherwise.\nThe secret-key based system must be designed such that the mFAR is exponentially as small as possible, while we require FRR to be negligible.\nThe encoder can be described by the encoding function (S, M ) = e(X N ), where S ∈ {φ e , 1, 2, · · · , |S|} is the generated secret and M ∈ {1, 2, · · · , |M|} the public helper message. Here φ e is the secret-value if the encoder could not assign a secret. The decoder operations are given by S y = d(M, Y N ), where S y ∈ {φ d , 1, 2, · · · , |S|} is the estimated secret. Now φ d is the estimated secret-value if the decoder could not ﬁnd an estimated secret. Note that an impostor can choose Z N = i(M ), depending on the helper data M . This impostor sequence z N ∈ Y N is then presented to the decoder that forms S z = d(M, Z N ) = d(M, i(M )). The equality-checker compares the output of the encoder, i.e. the secret S, to the output of the decoder, i.e. the estimated secret\nDeﬁnition 3: False-acceptance exponent E is achievable if for all δ > 0 and all N large enough there exists an encoder and a decoder such that\nTheorem 3: . For a secret-key based authentication system the maximum achievable false-acceptance exponent E is equal to I(X; Y ). Also in the secret-key based scenario I(X; Y ) is the fundamental limit.\nWe are investigating a so-called secret-key based authenti- cation system. Observe that the secret S that is sent to the equality-checker should be secured using cryptographic tech- niques. Crucial is that we do not have to encrypt and decrypt the secret S here. It is possible to apply a one-way function on both the enrollment secret S and the estimated secret S y or S z and check equality in the encrypted domain. This technique is also used for traditional password authentication.\nIt is also of interest that the same false-acceptance exponent for the basic setting is also achievable with secret-based authentication.\nThe investigated scheme is an extension of the Ahlswede- Csiszar [2] model in which no impostor is present. The relation between mutual information and reliabilities was investigated by Ho [7] and in Ho and Verdu [8]. Strengthening the secrecy constraint from weak to strong does not lead to Thm. 3.\nNote that in our achievability proof we must demonstrate that there exist encoders and decoders that (a) achieve the FRR constraint (11), and that (b) guarantee that the mFAR constraint (12) is met for E = I(X; Y ).\nFirst we show that there exist a (Slepian-Wolf) code for reconstruction of X N by the decoder, see Fig. 4. This code deﬁnes the M -labeling. Fix ε > 0 and N , and consider the typical set A N ε (XY ).\nTo each x N ∈ X N a label m that is uniformly chosen from {1, 2, · · · , M} is assigned. Denote this label by m(x N ). Upon\nobserving x N the encoder sends m(x N ) to the decoder. The decoder chooses the unique x N such that m(x N ) = m(x N ) and (x N , y N ) ∈ A N ε (XY ). If such an x N cannot be found, the decoder declares an error. It is not important what value x N gets in that case.\nAveraged over the ensemble of M -labelings, the error prob- ability is smaller than or equal to 2ε, for N large enough, when |M| = 2 N (H(X|Y )+3ε) , hence there exists an M -labeling with\nNext assume that an S-labeling used by the encoder during enrollment satisﬁes s(x N ) : X N → {1, 2, · · · , |S|} for x N ∈ A N ε (X), and s(x N ) = φ e for x N / ∈ A N ε (X). Moreover assume that the decoder outputs as estimated secret s(x N ), where x N is the output of the SW-decoder, if this decoder did not declare an error, and φ d if an error was declared by the SW-decoder. If no error occurred, both the SW-encoder input x N and (equal) SW-decoder output x N ∈ A N ε (X). This implies, that for a legitimate person, our encoder and decoder guarantee that\nFix a Slepian-Wolf code constructed before, and deﬁne for all m ∈ M the sets of typical sequences\nNow consider an m ∈ M. An impostor, knowing the helper message m, tries to pick a sequence z N such that the resulting estimated secret S z equals the secret key S of the person he claims to be. The impostor, knowing m, can decide for the most promising secret-key S z and then choose z N that results, together with m, in this most promising key. The impostor, knowing m, need only consider secrets S z that result from typical sequences, i.e. from x N ∈ A(m). Other sequences can not be output of the SW-decoder.\nFor each m, we distribute all sequences x N ∈ A(m) roughly uniform over s-labels. All non-typical sequences get label φ e . The number of typical sequences with label m is upper bounded by Pr{M = m}/2 −N (H(X)+ε) . Distributing these sequences over all s-labels uniformly leads to at most\nPr{M = m}/(2 −N (H(X)+ε) |S|) typical sequences having a certain secret label.\nThe joint probability that m occurs and an impostor, know- ing m, chooses the correct secret, is therefore upper-bounded by\nAn upper bound for the mFAR follows if we carry out the summation over all m. This results in\nfor large enough N , for all impostors, if we take the number of s-labels |S| = 2 N (I(X;Y )−2ε) . The upper bound (14) on the FRR and the upper bound (17) on the mFAR, results in the achievability of E = I(X; Y ).\nWe will show that for all encoders and decoders that achieve the FRR constraint (11), there is at least one impostor such that the mFAR constraint (12) is not satisﬁed for E > I(X; Y ).\n(18) hence C(m) is the set of secrets that can be reconstructed from m. Moreover let C(·, ·) be a function of s and m, such that C(s, m) = 1 for s ∈ C(m) and C(s, m) = 0 otherwise. Now\nAn impostor chooses, knowing m, a target secret s z ∈ C(m) with maximum conditional probability, i.e.,\nNext we consider a relation between conditional entropy and FAR.\ns P (s|m, C = 1) ≥ log 2 \t 1\n= log 2 P (C = 1) FAR\nP (C = 1) log 2 P (C = 1) mFAR\nIf we now let δ ↓ 0 and N → ∞ then since Pr{S y = S} ≤ δ, and P (C = 1) ≥ 1 − Pr{S y = S} ≥ 1 − δ, we get that for achievable false-acceptance exponents E ≤ I(X; Y ).\nConsider now the privacy leakage, which is the mutual information I(X N ; M ) between the biometric sequence X N and the helper data M . We can write for our code that demonstrates the achievability of E = I(X; Y ) that\nThe question now arises what the trade-off is between false- acceptance exponent and privacy-leakage rate. In order to in- vestigate it consider again the secret-key based authentication system in Fig. 3.\nDeﬁnition 4: False-acceptance exponent - privacy-leakage rate combination (E, L) is achievable if for all δ > 0 and all N large enough there exist encoders and decoders such that\nTheorem 4: For a secret-key based authentication system the region REL of achievable false-acceptance exponent and\nprivacy-leakage combinations is REL, where REL ∆ = {(E, L) : 0 ≤ E ≤ I(U ; Y ),\nProof: (a) The achievability part follows if we transform the biometric source (X, Y ) into a source (F, Y N ) again, where F is a quantized version of X N . (b) The converse is a mix of the converses in Sec. VI and that for Thm. 1 in [9].\nNote that the result found here coincides with the corre- sponding result in [9] and also in [10], if we replace secret-key rate with false-acceptance exponent. There is also a connection to Csiszar and Narayan [6], who considered the secret-key rate helper-data rate trade-off.\nWe extended the secret-key generation biometric scenario by considering false-acceptance rates. We found the funda- mental limits and trade-offs for the false-acceptance exponents. These exponents are equal to the known secret-key rates.\nCardinalities of auxiliary alphabets are easy to obtain but not considered here. Also the secret-key rate as a parameter is not considered here. Limiting the privacy-leakage rate is similar to bounding the rate of message M . It is obvious that the false- acceptance exponent cannot exceed the secret-key rate. Wang et al. [12] investigated biometric systems with a focus on the trade-off between both the FRR and mFAR exponents."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R. Ahlswede"},{"name":"I.
