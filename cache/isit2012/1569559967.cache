In this paper, we present a construction of classical codes based on polynomial construction again. One of the features of this construction is that not only the classical codes arisen from the construction have good parameters, but also quantum codes with reasonably good parameters can be produced from these classical codes. In particular, some new quantum codes are constructed (see Examples V.5 and V.6).\nIndex Terms\u2014Cyclotomic cosets, Polynomials, Hermitian self- orthogonal, Quantum distance."},"body":{"text":"One way to produce good quantum codes is to make use of Hermitian self-orthogonal classical codes [1]. To get -ary quantum codes, one needs Hermitian self-orthogonal classical codes over F 2 with good minimum distance of dual codes. Due to the fact that the Hermitian inner product involves power (see (IV.2)), the parameters of quantum codes derived from Hermitian self-orthogonal classical codes are usually constrained. For instance, in [6] (also see [5]), quantum MDS codes produced by using Hermitian self-orthogonal classical codes have relatively small dimension.\nIn this paper, we ﬁrst go to a ﬁeld of larger size to obtain classical codes over F 2 and then we select Hermitian self- orthogonal codes from these classical codes over F 2 . In this way, we can produce good quantum codes. Our idea to produce classical codes over F 2 from a ﬁeld of large size has already been studied in the previous papers [2], [7], [8], [10], [11] where polynomial codes were considered. The main idea of this paper is to convert some of these codes into Hermitian self-orthogonal in order to construct quantum codes. It turns out that some new quantum codes can be produced (see Examples V.5 and V.6).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we in- troduce some basic notations and results about cyclotomic cosets and corresponding polynomials. In Section III, we show how classical codes can be constructed from these cosets and polynomials. To construct quantum codes, we study dual codes of these classical codes in Section IV. In the last section, we apply the results in the previous sections to construction of quantum codes.\nLet q be a prime power and let n > 1 be a positive integer with gcd(q, n) = 1. Let m be the order of q modulo n, i.e, m is the smallest positive integer such that n divides q m − 1.\nIt is a well-know fact that all q-cyclotomic cosets partition the set Z n . Let S a 1 , S a 2 , . . . , S a t stand for all distinct q- cyclotomic cosets modulo n. Then, we have that Z n = ∪ t i=1 S a i and n = t i=1 |S a i |. We denote by s a the size of the q-cyclotomic coset S a .\nLemma II.1. For every a ∈ Z n , the size s a of S a divides m which is the order of q modulo n.\nProof: It is clear that s a is the smallest positive integer such that a ≡ aq s a mod n, i.e, s a is the smallest positive inte- ger such that n/ gcd(n, a) divides q s a − 1. Since n/ gcd(n, a) also divides q m − 1, we have m ≡ 0 mod s a by applying the long division.\nNow for each S a , we form s a polynomials in the following way. Let α 1 , . . . , α s a be an F q -basis of F q sa (note that F q sa is a subﬁeld of F q m ). Consider the polynomials f a,j (x) :=\nLemma II.2. For every a ∈ Z n , we have the following facts. (i) The polynomials f a,j (x) for j = 1, 2, . . . , s a are linearly\n(ii) f a,j (β) belongs to F q for all β ∈ U n ∪ {0}, where U n is the subgroup of n-th roots of unity in F ∗ q m , i.e., U n := {β ∈ F ∗ q m : β n = 1}.\nProof: (i) is clear since the coefﬁcients of x a in f a,j (x) are α j and α 1 , α 2 , . . . , α s a form an F q -basis of F q sa .\nTo prove (ii), it is sufﬁcient to prove that (f a,j (β)) q = f a,j (β) for every β ∈ U n ∪ {0}. Consider\nIn this section, we give a construction of classical codes basing on the facts from Section 2. For a positive integer r\nDenote the size of P K by k r . From Lemma II.2, it is clear that the polynomial space V r spanned by P r over F q has dimension k r .\nProposition III.1. The code C r deﬁned in (III.1) is a q-ary linear code with parameters [n + 1, k r , ≥ n + 1 − r].\nProof: As the degree of every polynomial f (x) in V r is at most r ≤ n − 1, it has at most r roots. Thus, (f (β)) β∈U n ∪{0} has the Hamming weight at least n + 1 − r as long as f is a nonzero polynomial. Hence, the dimension of C r is the same as the one of V r , i.e., dim(C r ) = k r . Moreover, the minimum distance of C r is at least n + 1 − r.\nExample III.2. Let q = 4 and n = 51. Then the order of 4 modulo 51 is m = 4. All 4-cyclotomic cosets modulo 51 are\n{7, 10, 28, 40} {9, 15, 36, 42} {11, 23, 41, 44} {17} \t {18, 21, 30, 33} {19, 25, 43, 49}\nFor instance, for r = 16, we obtain a 4-ary [52, 5, ≥ 36]-linear code. This is an optimal code in the sense that for given length and dimension, the minimum distance can not be improved. For r = 17, we obtain a 4-ary [52, 6, ≥ 35]-linear code which is best known based on the online table [4].\nExample III.3. Let q = 4 and n = 63. Then the order of 4 modulo 63 is m = 3. All 4-cyclotomic cosets modulo 63 are\n{7, 28, 49} {9, 18, 36} {10, 34, 40} {11, 44, 50} {13, 19, 52} {14, 35, 56} {15, 51, 60} \t {21} \t {22, 25, 37} {23, 29, 53} {26, 38, 41} {27, 45, 54} {30, 39, 57} {31, 55, 61} {47, 59, 62} {43, 46, 58} \t {42}\nFor instance, for r = 16, we get a 4-ary [64, 4, ≥ 48]-linear code. This is an optimal code in the sense that for given length and dimension, the minimum distance can not be improved. For r = 20, again we get an optimal 4-ary [64, 7, ≥ 44]-linear code. For r = 21, an optimal 4-ary [64, 8, ≥ 43]-linear code can be derived as well.\nIn this section, we study dual codes for those codes arisen from cyclotomic cosets. From now on, we assume that q is even. Then n is always odd (as gcd(n, q) = 1) and hence n + 1 is even.\nTwo q-cyclotomic cosets S a and S b are called dual if there exists c ∈ S b such that a + c is divisible by n. For instance,\nin Example III.2, {1, 4, 13, 16} and {35, 38, 47, 50} are dual to each other. It is clear that the dual of a given cyclotomic coset is unique. Moreover, we have the following facts.\nLemma IV.1. Let S a be the dual of a cyclotomic coset S b . Then we have\n(ii) For every x ∈ S a , there exists y ∈ S b such that x + y is divisible by n.\nProof: We may assume that a + b is divisible by n. By deﬁnition, s b is the smallest positive integer such that n divides b(q s b − 1). Thus, s b is the smallest positive integer such that n divides −b(q s b − 1). As −b(q s b − 1) ≡ a(q s b − 1) mod n, the desired result of part (i) follows.\nLet x ≡ aq i mod n for some integer i. By deﬁnition, there exists c ∈ S b such that a ≡ −c mod n. Thus, x ≡ aq i ≡ −cq i mod n. Put y = cq i mod n ∈ S b . We obtain the desired result of part (ii).\nConsider a set S of cyclotomic cosets such that {0} ∈ S. Let S ∗ denote the collection of duals of cyclotomic cosets in S. We denote by P S the polynomial set\nLet V S be the F q -space spanned by all polynomials in P S . Deﬁne the F q -linear code by\nProposition IV.2. Let A = ∪ t i=1 S a i be the set of all q- cyclotomic cosets modulo n. Then the Euclidean dual of C S is C R , where R = {{0}} ∪ (A − S ∗ ).\n|T | = n+1−dim(C S ) (note the fact that S∈A |S| = |Z n | = n). To prove our lemma, it is sufﬁcient to show that every codeword in C S is orthogonal to all codewords of C R under the dot product.\nFor a polynomial u(x) in P A , we denote by c u the codeword (u(β)) β∈U n ∪{0} . Let f (x), g(x) be polynomials in P S and P R , respectively. If both f (x) and g(x) are equal to 1. Then c f = c g is the all-one vector 1. It is clear that in this case c f and c g are orthogonal under the dot product. Now assume that at least one of f (x), g(x) is not equal to 1. Then for any terms x i in f (x) and terms x j in g(x), we have i + j ≡ 0 mod n. Thus, the product f (x)g(x) contains only terms x k with k ≡ 0 mod n. For such k we have\nwhere α is an n-th primitive root of unity in U n . This implies that c f and c g are orthogonal under the dot product. The desired result follows.\nExample IV.3. Let q = 4 and n = 51. Let S = {{0}, {1, 4, 13, 16}}. By Example III.2, we know that R = A − {{35, 38, 47, 50}}.\nIn order to apply our results to quantum codes, we want to discuss the Hermitian dual of C S as well. Let us assume that q is equal to 2 . The Hermitian inner product of the two vectors (u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u n+1 ) and (v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v n+1 ) in F n 2 is deﬁned by\nBy abuse of notations, for a set S = {S a } a∈I of cyclotomic cosets, we denote by S the set {S a } a∈I of the cyclotomic cosets .\nProposition IV.4. Under the inner product (IV.2), the Hermi- tian dual of C S is C T , where T = {{0}} ∪ (A − ( S) ∗ ).\nProof: It is clear that the Hermitian dual of C S is the Euclidean dual of C S . Now the desired result follows from Proposition IV.2.\nExample IV.5. Let q = 4 and n = 51. Let S = {{0}, {1, 4, 13, 16}}. By Example III.2, we know that T = A − {{19, 25, 43, 49}}.\nIn this section, we show how to apply the results from the previous sections to obtain quantum codes.\nInstead of giving several complicated results with detailed formula, we give a general result in this section. Then we use examples to illustrate our result.\nTheorem V.1. Let S be a set of q-cyclotomic cosets modulo n and let T = {{0}} ∪ (A − ( S) ∗ ) such that ( S) ∗ contains all cyclotomic cosets {S a : n + 2 − d ≤ a ≤ n − 1}. If S is a subset of T , then there exists an -ary quantum code [[n + 1, n + 1 − 2k, ≥ d]], where k is the F q -dimension of C S .\nProof: By Proposition IV.4, the Hermtian dual of C S is C T . Under our assumption, C S is Hermitian self-orthogonal under the inner product (IV.2). Thus, we obtain an -ary quantum code [[n + 1, n + 1 − 2k]] with minimum distance at least the Hamming distance of C T (see [1]). As P T contains polynomials of degree at most n+1−d, the Hamming distance of C T is at least d. This completes the proof.\nExample V.2. Let q = 4 and n = 21. Then the order of 4 modulo 21 is m = 3. All 4-cycloyomic cosets modulo 21 are\n{0} \t {1, 4, 16}} {2, 8, 11} {3, 6, 12} {5, 17, 20} \t {7}\nLet S = {{0}, {1, 4, 16}, {2, 8, 11}, {3, 6, 12}}. Then 2S = S and (2S) ∗ = {{0}, {5, 17, 20}, {10, 13, 19}, {9, 15, 18}}. Moreover, S is contained in T = {{0}} ∪ (A − (2S) ∗ ). As S 17 , S 18 , S 19 and S 20 belong to (2S) ∗ , we obtain a binary quantum [[22, 2, 6]] code which achieves the best-known pa- rameters [4].\nExample V.3. Let q = 4 and n = 51. Then the order of 4 modulo 51 is m = 4. Let S = {{0}, {1, 4, 13, 16}, {2, 8, 26, 32}, {6, 24, 27, 45}}. Then 2S = {{0}, {1, 4, 13, 16}, {2, 8, 26, 32}, {3, 12, 39, 48}} and\nMoreover, S is contained in T = {{0}} ∪ (A − (2S) ∗ ). As S 47 , S 48 , S 49 and S 50 belong to (2S) ∗ , we obtain a binary quantum [[52, 26, 6]] code which meets the best-known one in the online table [4].\nIn the similar way, we obtain binary quantum codes with parameters [[52, 24, 7]] and [[52, 8, 10]]. Both codes meet the parameters of the best-known ones in [4].\nExample V.4. Let q = 4 and n = 63. Then the order of 4 modulo 63 is m = 3.\n(i) S = {{0}, {1, 4, 16}, {2, 8, 32}}. Then 2S = S and (2S) ∗ = {{0}, {31, 55, 61}, {47, 59, 62}}. Moreover, S is contained in T = {{0}}∪(A − (2S) ∗ ). As S 61 and S 62 belong to (2S) ∗ , we obtain a binary quantum [[64, 50, 4]] code which is optimal [4].\n(ii) S = {{0}}, {1, 4, 16}, {2, 8, 32}, {6, 24, 33}}. Then 2S = {{0}}, {1, 4, 16}, {2, 8, 32}, {3, 12, 48}} and (2S) ∗ = {{0}, {15, 51, 60}{31, 55, 61}, {47, 59, 62}}.\nMoreover, S is contained in T = {{0} ∪ (A − (2S) ∗ ). As S 59 , S 60 , S 61 and S 62 belong to (2S) ∗ , we obtain a binary quantum [[64, 44, 6]] code which is optimal again [4].\nAnalogously, binary quantum codes with parameters [[64, 38, 7]] and [[64, 32, 8]] can be derived. Both codes meet the parameters of the best-known ones in [4].\nExample V.5. Let q = 16 and n = 51. Then the order of 16 modulo 51 is m = 2. Let S \t = \t {{0}, {12, 39}, {8, 26}, {4, 13}}. Then 4S = {{0}, {1, 16}, {2, 32}, {3, 48}} and (4S) ∗ = {{0}, {3, 48}, {19, 49}, {35, 50}}. Moreover, S is contained in T = {{0}} ∪ (A − (2S) ∗ ). As S 50 , S 49 and S 48 belong to (4S) ∗ , we obtain a 4-ary quantum [[52, 38, 5]]-code.\nLikewise, we obtain 4-ary quantum codes with parameters [[52, 34, 6]], [[52, 30, 7]], [[52, 26, 8]], [[52, 22, 9]], [[52, 18, 10]] and [[52, 14, 12]]. The last one meets the parameters of the best-known ones in [3] and the rest are new to the online table [3].\nExample V.6. Let q = 64 and n = 585. Then the order of 64 modulo 585 is m = 2. Let S = {{0}, {8, 512}, {16, 439}}. Then 8S = {{0}, {1, 64}, {2, 128}} and (8S) ∗ = {{0}, {457, 583}, {521, 584}}. Moreover, S is contained in T = {{0}}∪(A − (2S) ∗ ). As S 584 and S 583 belong to (8S) ∗ , we obtain a 8-ary quantum [[586, 576, 4]]-code.\nIn the similar way, we draw 8-ary quantum codes with parameters [[586, 572, 5]], [[586, 568, 6]], [[586, 564, 7]], [[586, 560, 8]], [[586, 556, 9]], [[586, 552, 10]], [[586, 548, 11]], [[586, 544, 12]], \t [[586, 540, 13]], \t [[586, 536, 14]], [[586, 532, 15]] and so on. Now, compared with the online table [3], these codes have better parameters. For instance, 8-quantum codes with the parameters [[589, 553, 4]],\n[[589, 513, 6]], [[627, 561, 5]], [[627, 531, 6]], [[627, 501, 7]], [[629, 557, 6]], [[629, 533, 7]], [[629, 521, 8]] are given in [3]. We can see that with the same distances our codes have bigger dimensions, but smaller lengths."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A. Ashikhmin"},{"name":"E.
