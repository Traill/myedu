We ﬁrst study the effect of the secondary nodes\u2019 transmission parameters such as power and channel access probabilities on the stable throughput of the primary node. If the sensing is perfect, then the secondary nodes do not interfere with the primary node and thus do not affect its stable throughput. In case of imperfect sensing, it is shown that if the primary node\u2019s arrival rate is less than some calculated value, then the secondary transmissions do not affect its queueing stability; otherwise, the secondary nodes should regulate their transmission parameters to reduce their interference on the primary. Finally, we propose a multinode relaying protocol based on distributed space-time orthogonal block codes, that uses the secondary nodes as relays of the primary node\u2019s trafﬁc to compensate for the interference they might cause. In this case, for appropriate modulation scheme and under perfect sensing, it is shown that the more secondary nodes in the system, the better for the primary user in terms of his stable throughput.

With cognitive radio technology, secondary (unlicensed) users are allowed to access the licensed spectrum if sensed to be idle. At the same time, as the sensing procedure may be erroneous, some measures must be taken to protect the primary (licensed) users from possible interference due to sensing errors at the secondary nodes.\nCognitive radio has been studied from an information the- oretic point of view in [3]. However, information theoretic analysis does not take into account the bursty nature of the trafﬁc which is essential in studying network layer aspects such as the stable throughput and the average delay. The stable throughput of a simple cognitive network consisting of one primary and one secondary source-destination pairs was studied in [4], under the SINR threshold model for reception with relaying for perfect and erroneous sensing. However, such simpliﬁed model does not capture the effect of the potential interference induced in a real network with\nmany secondary nodes sharing the spectrum with the primary, and also, relaying is limited to single node relaying. In [5], cognitive relaying has been studied for an uplink where a single dedicated cognitive relay forwards unsuccessful packets from source nodes during their idle slots under the assumption of perfect sensing. In [6], a network consisting of a primary TDMA uplink with some dedicated cognitive relays to help the primary, and secondary Ad-Hoc network is considered with stable throughput as performance criterion. However, only the case of perfect sensing of the primary nodes was considered and the analysis is limited to collision channel model for reception which does not capture the multipacket reception (MPR) capability of modern receivers and is not a realistic model for Ad-Hoc network where different nodes can be largely separated in space and interference is likely to be small. Furthermore, only single node relaying was considered despite the presence of several dedicated relays in the system.\nIn this paper, we study the effect of secondary interference on the primary\u2019s stable throughput which may occur due to incorrect sensing or even with perfect sensing in the pres- ence of malicious attacks. We adopt the physical interference model for reception (SINR threshold model) in contrast with the oversimpliﬁed collision model to calculate the maximum transmission power and channel access probabilities that sec- ondary users can employ without affecting the primary\u2019s queue stability. As a method for mitigating the negative effects of secondary interference, we propose a multinode relaying protocol that forces all the secondary nodes that can decode a primary unsuccessful packet to relay that packet using orthogonal space-time block codes [7] and it is shown that under this protocol, the more secondary nodes present in the network, the more beneﬁt for the primary in terms of his maximum stable throughput due to diversity and/or power gain introduced while the secondary nodes might beneﬁt by having access to a larger fraction of idle slots.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In section II, we describe the system model. In sections III and IV, we study the primary node\u2019s stable throughput in the perfect and imperfect sensing cases respectively. In section V, we propose and analyze the relaying protocol to beneﬁt of the large population of secondary nodes. Section VI presents the numerical results and in section VII, we conclude the paper.\nThe proofs are omitted due to space limitations but can be found in [8].\nThe system consists of one primary source-destination pair and a secondary Ad-Hoc network consisting of N secondary source-destination pairs. All nodes have buffers of inﬁnite capacity to store the packets to be transmitted. Time is slotted with packet duration equal to one slot duration. The arrival process to the primary node is assumed to be stationary with an average rate of λ P packets/slot, while the secondary nodes are assumed to be saturated to avoid queueing interac- tion. Throughout the paper, we designate the primary source node with S P , the primary destination with D P and the ith secondary source node with S i , where i ∈ {1, 2, ..., N }. The primary source node transmits at power P P while all secondary nodes transmit at common power P 0 .\nThe distance between node i and node j is denoted by r ij , where i ∈ {S k |k = P, 1, 2, ..., N } and j ∈ {D P , S k |k = 1, 2, ..., N }. For instance, r S i D P denotes the distance between the ith secondary source node and the primary destination node. The path loss exponent is assumed to be equal to α throughout the network. The link between the (i, j) pair of nodes is subject to stationary Rayleigh block fading with fading coefﬁcients h ij ∼ CN (0, σ 2 ij ) which are independent among links. All nodes are subject to independent additive white complex Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance N 0 . To properly model the interference throughout the net- work, we adopt the SINR threshold model where node j is able to successfully decode a packet if the received signal-to- interference plus noise ratio (SINR) exceeds some threshold β j . Upon the success or failure of a packet reception at a node, an instantaneous and error free Acknowledgment/Non- Acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) message is fedback to the corresponding transmitter.\nBoth the primary and the secondary users transmit over the same frequency band where the primary user has the priority for transmission, while the secondary users are restricted to use the idle slots of the primary. At the beginning of each slot, secondary nodes sense the channel and only if a slot is detected to be idle, do they access the channel in a random access way. A secondary node transmits with probability q whenever it detects an idle slot.\nSecondary nodes should be \u201ctransparent\u201d to the primary in the sense that their transmissions should not affect some performance criterion (here, the queueing stability) of the primary node. If the sensing is perfect, the secondary nodes do not interfere with the primary and can employ any trans- mission parameters (power/channel access probability) without affecting the primary. However, if the sensing is not perfect, the secondary nodes must limit their interference on the primary node by controlling their transmission parameters. In this paper, we restrict the analysis to the following symmetric case, but the analysis of the general non-symmetric case can be handled similarly [8]; speciﬁcally, we assume:\nUnder the saturation assumption of the secondary queues, there is no issue of stability except for the primary queue. The primary queue evolves as:\nwhere Q t P is the length of the primary queue at the beginning of time slot t; X t P and Y t P are respectively the arrival and the service processes at the primary source queue in time slot t and (x) + =max (x, 0). A queue evolving as in (1) is said to be stable if for every x ∈ N 0 , lim t→∞ Pr[Q t P < x ] = F (x) with lim x→∞ F (x) = 1. Refer to [9] for more general deﬁnitions.\nIn this case, secondary nodes are able to perfectly identify the primary idle slots where they can access the channel from the busy slots where they must remain silent.\nwhere µ max P = E[Y t P ] denotes the average service rate at the primary node.\nDue to fading and other channel impairments, the secondary nodes may misidentify the idle slots and hence interfere with the primary.\nTwo errors may occur while sensing the channel, namely, false alarm and misdetection errors. False alarm occurs when the primary node is idle but it is sensed to be busy. Clearly, false alarm error does not affect the primary\u2019s stable through- put but degrades the throughput of the secondary nodes. Misdetection occurs when the primary node is busy but it is sensed to be idle. Secondary nodes will then transmit with the primary and may lead to the instability of its queue.\nIn our case, the probability of the misdetection event P e is the same for all secondary nodes by symmetry of the conﬁguration.\nThe stability condition of the primary queue in the imperfect sensing case is given by λ P < µ P where:\n(3) Proposition 1:\nThe primary node service rate as given by (3), satisﬁes: (i) 0 ≤ µ P < µ max P (ii) lim\n[1 − qP e ] N if P P > 0 and P 0 → ∞ 0 if P P → 0.\n(iv) ∂µ P ∂a > 0, i.e., µ P is strictly increasing with a. (v) lim\nFrom proposition 1, we can draw some important conclusions: (i) states that the effect of the interference due to erroneous sensing at the secondary nodes is the degradation of the service rate of the primary licensed user. (ii),(iii) and (iv) reveal that unless a → ∞ i.e. either P P → ∞ or P 0 → 0, the primary node cannot achieve its maximum service rate µ max P that is achieved in the case of perfect sensing. Also, for ﬁxed P P , secondary nodes have a maximum power - possibly inﬁnite if λ P < µ max P (1 − qP e ) N - at which they can transmit while remaining transparent to the primary node. Moreover, even if the interference of the secondary nodes is very high (case of P 0 → ∞), the primary node can still achieve a portion (1 − qP e ) N of its maximum service rate µ max P . Finally, (v), (vi) and (vii) show that for ﬁxed P P and P 0 , the secondary nodes can control their interference level on the primary by adjusting their transmission probabilities q which is sometimes easier to implement than power control.\nand for the maximum value of q to get the maximum possible transmission power (P 0 ) and maximum possible transmission probability (q) of the secondary nodes while remaining \u201ctransparent\u201d to the primary node, i.e., without affecting its stability.\n     \n    \n(4) For ﬁxed primary transmission power P P , the maximum transmission power allowed at secondary nodes is given by:\n   \n  \n(5) From equations (4) and (5), we conclude that for ﬁxed P P , if λ P < µ max P 1 − P e a+1 N , secondary nodes can transmit with any desired chosen probability without affecting the stability of the primary while they have to backoff to reduce their interference on the primary node if µ max P 1 − P e a+1 N < λ P < µ max P . On the other hand, for ﬁxed transmission probability q, if λ P < µ max P (1 − qP e ) N , secondary nodes can transmit at any power without affecting the stability of the primary\nnode while there exists a ﬁnite maximum allowed power if λ P > µ max P (1 − qP e ) N . This can be understood by noting that (1 − qP e ) N is the probability that none of the secondary source nodes transmit in a slot while the primary is busy, and hence, using random access as a multiple access protocol in the secondary network provides an additional protection to the primary in addition to the simplicity of operation for Ad-Hoc networks.\nRelaying represents an incentive for the primary nodes to share their channel resources with secondary users if it beneﬁts them. In this section, we propose and analyze a simple multinode relaying protocol in the perfect sensing case which serves as an upper bound for the imperfect sensing case as well as a good approximation for systems employing cooperative and sophisticated sensing techniques.\nThe relaying protocol achieves a throughput gain with no channel state information (CSI) about h S k D P fading coefﬁ- cients available at the secondary nodes by using Distributed Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (D-OSTBC). That is each of the secondary nodes that is able to successfully decode a pri- mary packet will mimic an antenna in a regular STC setting of a multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel. Such OSTBC always exists for one dimensional signal constellations for any number of relaying nodes [10]. In this case, these OSTBC schemes achieve full diversity gain and/or power gain at coding rate =1 while ensuring simple decoding rule based only on linear processing at the receiver. Hence, the assumption of one dimensional signal constellation leads to both analytical tractability as well as simplicity of implementation by avoiding variable rate systems needed in case of two dimensional constellations transmitted using orthogonal space-time block codes [11] or joint decoding and partial diversity gain in quasi- orthogonal full rate space-time codes [12].\nEach of the relaying nodes must know which antenna it mimics in the underlying STC used which can be achieved either by coordination between the secondary nodes or by prior node indexing and observing ACK/NACK packets generated by the secondary nodes regarding each primary packet.\nThe relaying protocol works as follows: If the primary node transmits a packet and is unsuccessful while one or more secondary nodes are able to successfully decode that packet, then these secondary nodes send an ACK message to the primary and the primary node releases the packet from its queue. We assume that this ACK will also be heard by all the secondary nodes and thus the secondary nodes which could not receive that packet will abstain from transmission until that packet is successfully delivered to the primary destination and thus avoid interfering with the primary\u2019s relayed packets. In the next available primary idle slot, the secondary source nodes which were able to decode the packet will transmit it using D-OSTBC as described above. The primary packets are given priority for transmission, i.e., a secondary source node\nwill not transmit its own packets unless it does not have any primary packets to relay and none of the other secondary nodes has any.\nResults are restricted to the special case of Rayleigh fading, but similar conclusions hold for arbitrary fading distributions [8]. Under the previously described relaying protocol, the stability condition of the system is:\n(9) and Γ(s, x) is the upper incomplete gamma function and can be represented by the integral: Γ(s, x) = ∞ x t s−1 e − t dt.\nThe success probability P s as given by (8) is strictly increasing with N . Moreover, as N → ∞, P s → 1. Proposition 3:\nOnly if µ max P < P s [1−(1−P d ) N ] P d \t , the maximum possible arrival rate at the primary node that keeps the system stable as given by (6) increases compared to the case of no-relaying.\nA sufﬁcient condition is to have µ max P < P s which is clearly satisﬁed for some N , possibly large.\nHence, the beneﬁt for the primary user achieved by relaying increases with the number of secondary nodes sharing the spectrum. If the number of secondary nodes in the network cannot satisfy the condition in proposition 3, then increasing the secondary nodes\u2019 power (to increase P s ) will help satisfying that condition for a smaller number of secondary relaying nodes (See Figures 3 and 4).\nIt should be noted that one node relaying (N = 1) always leads to higher primary stable throughput rate if:\nIn other words, if the primary and secondary nodes transmit at the same power, then one node relaying always helps if the channel between secondary source and primary destination is on average better than the channel between the primary source and primary destination as was shown in [5].\nFinally, the effect of relaying on the secondary nodes can be intuitively understood by noting that by increasing the\nstable throughput of the primary due to relaying, the fraction 1 − λ P µ P of idle slots available to the secondary nodes\nincreases. A portion of this fraction will be dedicated for relaying the primary\u2019s packets and the rest for secondary transmissions. Hence, the net beneﬁt for the secondary nodes might be an increase or a decrease of throughputs. It is shown in [8] that for a single secondary node, either both the primary and the secondary beneﬁt from relaying or none. Please refer to [8] for detailed and quantitative analysis of the effect of relaying on the secondary nodes\u2019 throughputs.\nFigures 1 and 2 illustrate the effect of incorrect sensing on the normalized maximum stable throughput of the primary node as given by (3). The term σ 2 SP DP r −α SP DP P P β\nis ﬁxed at a value of 10W. Figure 1 shows that µ P can degrade from its perfect sensing value µ max P even for small number of secondary nodes and small values of qP e and shows that sec- ondary nodes can effectively limit their interference on the pri- mary by controlling their transmission power P 0 , their channel access probability q or by enhancing the sensing performance to reduce P e . Figure 2 plots the normalized maximum stable throughput rate at the primary node versus the number of sec- ondary nodes N showing a similar effect. However, as shown in ﬁgure 1, lim a→0 µ P µ max\n= 0; showing that for small values of λ P , controlling the secondary nodes\u2019 transmission parameters is not as crucial as controlling the number of secondary transmissions in the system. This motivates the relaying protocol described above which is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. Let SN R = P 0 r −α 0 σ 2 0 β P N\n. Figures 3 and 4 plot the maximum stable throughput rate at the primary node (λ max P ) as given by (6) versus the number of secondary nodes for different SNR values. With no relaying, λ max P = µ max P and is shown by dotted line. It is clear that regardless of the parameter values, sufﬁciently large N always outperforms the non-relaying case and with higher SNR or higher P d , a smaller number of secondary relays is needed to outperform the non-relaying case. We also note that at SNR = 0 dB, even one node relaying leads to better performance than the non-relaying case.\nIn this paper, we studied the effect of the interference introduced on a primary user sharing the spectrum with some secondary nodes because of erroneous sensing. It is shown that if the primary arrival rate is less than some ﬁnite value, there is no need for controlling the secondary nodes\u2019 transmis- sion parameters (power/transmission probabilities), otherwise, these parameters must be appropriately regulated. It is shown that if the secondary nodes are forced to relay the primary\u2019s packets, then the primary beneﬁts from relaying and mean- while, the secondary nodes might beneﬁt by increasing the fraction of idle slots available for their transmissions. Future work includes the analysis of the relaying protocol in the\nimperfect sensing case. The study of the delay performance of our relaying protocol is also necessary for delay constrained systems."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"N. Devroye"},{"name":"M.
