The idea behind GT is that if the number of positives is much smaller than the number of subjects, one can reduce the number of experiments by testing adequately chosen groups of subjects rather than testing each subject individually. In its full generality, GT may be viewed as the problem of inferring the state of a system from a superposition of the state vectors of a subset of the system\u2019s elements. As such, it has found many applications in communication theory, signal processing, computer science, mathematics, biology, etc. (for example see [1]-[3]).\nAlthough many models have been considered for combi- natorial GT, two main models include the original model considered by Dorfman [4] (henceforth, conventional GT) and the adder model (also known as the adder channel or quantitative GT) [1]. In the former case, the result of a test is an indicator determining if there exist at least one positive in the test (equal to 0 if no positive in the test, and 1 otherwise), while in the latter case, the result of a test speciﬁes the exact number of positives in that test. Motivated by applications in genome sequence processing, we propose a novel non-adaptive test model termed semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT). This model accounts for the fact that in most applications a test is not precise enough to exactly determine the number of positives, but it is more informative than a simple indicator of the presence of at least one positive. In other words, schemes in which results are obtained using a test device with limited precision may be modeled as instances of SQGT 1 .\nWe also allow for the possibility of having different amounts of sample material for different test subjects, which results in non-binary test matrices. Although binary testing is required for some applications \u2013 such as coin weighing \u2013 in other\napplications, such as conﬂict resolution in multiple access channel (MAC) and genotyping, non-binary tests may be used to further reduce the number of tests. In the former example, different non-binary values in a test correspond to different power levels of the users, while in the latter example, they correspond to different amounts of genetic material of differ- ent subjects. The reason that non-binary tests are extremely important is that in applications like genotyping, tests are very expensive so that one may be inclined to reduce the number of tests at the expense of extracting more genetic material. While there exists information theoretic analysis that is applicable to the non-binary test matrices [10, Ch. 6], to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, the only attempts of non- binary code construction relevant to group testing is limited to a handful of papers, including [6] and [7], where constructions are considered for an adder MAC channel.\nFor the new and versatile model of SQGT with Q-ary test results and q-ary test sample sizes, Q, q \u2022 2, we de- ﬁne the concept of capacity. Furthermore, we deﬁne a new generalization of the family of disjunct codes, ﬁrst introduced in [8], called \u201cSQ-disjunct\u201d codes. Similar to the family of disjunct codes, this new code family may be decoded using a simple, low-complexity algorithm. We conclude our exposition with a probabilistic method for code construction, of use in applications where the physics of the experiments prohibits structured codes.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the SQGT model, while Section III introduces the capacity of SQGT. In Section IV, we deﬁne SQ-disjunct codes and present some simple properties of these codes. In Section V, we describe a number of constructions for SQGT codes.\nThroughout this paper, we adopt the following notation. Bold-face upper-case and bold-face lower-case letters denote matrices and vectors, respectively. Calligraphic letters are used to denote sets. Asymptotic symbols such as \u201e and op¨q are used in a standard manner. For an integer k, we deﬁne rks :\u201c t0, 1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , k ´ 1u.\nLet N denote the number of test subjects, and let m denote the number of positives. Also, let u denote an upper bound on the number of positives (i.e. m § u). Let S i denote the i th subject, i P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , Nu, and let S i j \u201c D j be the j th positive, j P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , mu. Furthermore, let D denote the set of positives, so that |D| \u201c m. We assign to each subject a unique q-ary vector of length n, termed the \u201csignature\u201d or the codeword of the subject. Each coordinate of the signature\ncorresponds to a test. If x i P rqs n denotes the signature of the i th subject, then the k th coordinate of x i may be viewed as the \u201camount\u201d of S i (i.e. sample size, concentration, etc.) used in the k th test. Note that the symbol 0 indicates that S i is not in the test. For convenience, we refer to the collection of codewords arranged column-wise as the test matrix or code.\nThe result of each test is an integer from the set rQs. Each test outcome depends on the number of positives and their sample amount in the test through Q thresholds, ⌘ l (l P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , Qu). More precisely, the outcome of the k th test, y k , equals\nx k,i j \u2020 ⌘ r `1 , \t (1) where x k,i j is the k th coordinate of x i j , and ⌘ 0 \u201c 0. Based on the deﬁnition, it is clear that SQGT may be viewed as a concatenation of an adder channel and a decimator (quantizer). Also, if q \u201c Q \u201c 2 and ⌘ 1 \u201c 1, the SQGT model reduces to conventional GT. Furthermore, if Q ´ 1 \u201c mpq ´ 1q and @r P rQs, ⌘ r \u201c r, then the SQGT reduces to the adder channel, with a possibly non-binary test matrix. Note that in this model, we assume that ⌘ Q ° pq ´ 1qu.\nOf special interest is SQGT with a uniform quantizer - i.e. SQGT with equidistant thresholds. In this case, ⌘ r \u201c r⌘, where r P rQ ` 1s, and the following deﬁnition may be used to simplify (1).\nDeﬁnition 1: The \u201cSQ-sum\u201d of s \u2022 1 codewords x j P rqs n , 1 § j § s, denoted by y \u201c Æ s j \u201c1 x j \u201c x 1 f x 2 f ¨ ¨ ¨ f x s , is a vector of length n with its i th coordinate equal to\n` x i,2 ` ¨ ¨ ¨ ` x i,s ⌘\n. \t (2) Here, \u201c`\u201d stands for real-valued addition.\nx i j . \t (3) where x i j is the signature of the j th positive.\nIt is well-known that group testing may be viewed as a special instance of a multiple access channel (MAC) (e.g. see [10]). Using this connection, Malyutov [9], D\u2019yachkov [10], and Atia et al. [11] derived information theoretic necessary and sufﬁcient conditions on the required number of tests for conventional GT. It is tedious, yet straight- forward, to show that the model described in [9], [10], [11] may also be used to evaluate SQGT schemes. The main difference in the analysis of GT and SQGT arises due to the different forms of the mutual information used to express the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions. We therefore focus on characterizing the mutual informations arising in the SQGT framework. Our notation follows the setup of [11].\nLet the sample amount of each subject in each test be chosen in an i.i.d manner from a q-ary alphabet, according to a distribution P T . Also, let D tiu 1 and D tiu 2 be disjoint\npartitions of the set of positives, D, such that |D tiu 1 | \u201c i and |D tiu 2 | \u201c m´i; we denote by A tiu D the set of all possible pairs pD tiu 1 , D tiu 2 q. For a single test, we deﬁne y as the test result, and t tiu D j (where j \u201c 1, 2) as a vector of size 1 ˆ |D tiu j |, with its k th entry equal to the sample amount of the k th positive of D tiu j in the test. Fig. 1 shows a choice of pD t2u 1 , D t2u 2 q and their corresponding vectors t t2u D 1 and t t2u D 2 for the case where m \u201c 5 and q \u201c 2.\nBy following the same steps as in [11], it can be shown that for any ﬁxed m, if the number of tests n satisﬁes\ni \u201c 1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , m, (4) then the average probability of error asymptotically approaches zero 2 . In this equation, Ipt tiu D 1 ; t tiu D 2 , y q stands for the mutual information between t tiu D 1 and pt tiu D 2 , y q. Note that since the sample amounts of the subjects are chosen independently and identically, the value of Ipt tiu D 1 ; t tiu D 2 , y q does not depend on the speciﬁc choice of pD tiu 1 , D tiu 2 q. Similarly, a necessary condition for zero average error probability for SQGT is\ni \u201c 1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , m. (5) Deﬁnition 2: [Asymptotic capacity of SQGT channel] Using (4) and (5), we deﬁne the asymptotic capacity of the chan- nel corresponding to the SQGT scheme (henceforth, SQGT channel) as\nC \u201c sup P T ,⌘ ↵ pm, P T , ⌘ q, \t (6) where ↵pm, P T , ⌘ q \u201c min i \u201c1,2,¨¨¨ ,m I pt tiu D1 ; t tiu D2 ,y q i , and where ⌘ is a vector of length Q with ⌘ k its k th entry.\nIn certain applications, ⌘ may be determined a priori by the resolution of the test equipment. In such applications, the only design parameter to optimize is P T . On the other hand, if one is able to control the thresholds, ⌘ becomes a design parameter and clearly exhibits a strong inﬂuence on the capacity of the test scheme.\nDeﬁne the rate of a group test as R \u201c log N n . The next theorem clariﬁes the use of the term \u201ccapacity\u201d in Deﬁnition 2. Theorem 1: For SQGT, C \u201c sup P T ,⌘ I pt tmu D 1 ; t tmu D 2 , y q{m, and all rates bellow capacity are achievable. In other words,\nfor every rate R \u2020 C, there exists a test design for which the average probability of error converges to zero. Conversely, any test design with zero achieving average probability of error must asymptotically satisfy R \u2020 C.\nProof: Follows from simple modiﬁcations of arguments in [9], [10].\nThe mutual information Ipt tmu D 1 ; t tmu D 2 , y q in this theorem may be evaluated as follows. Let W 1 denote the l 1 -norm of t tmu D 1 . Then,\nI SQ pt tmu D 1 ; t tmu D 2 , y q \u201c Hpy|t tmu D 2 q ´ Hpy|t tmu D 1 , t tmu D 2 q \u201c Hpyq. On the other hand @l P rQs,\nwhere P W 1 pw 1 q is the probability mass function (PMF) of W 1 and can be found using\nP W 1 pw 1 q \u201c P T pt 1 q ˚ P T pt 2 q ˚ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˚ P T pt m q, \t (8) where \u201c˚\u201d denotes convolution. Note that when q \u201c 2,\nDue to the complicated expression for the mutual informa- tion for an arbitrary distribution, a closed-form expression for the test capacity cannot be obtained. We therefore evaluated (6) numerically using a simple search procedure that allows us to quickly determine a lower bound on the capacity. Fig. 2 shows the obtained lower bound on the capacity when q \u201c 3, and Q \u201c 2 or Q \u201c 3. Table I shows one set of probability distributions and thresholds achieving this bound for Q \u201c 3.\nTable I reveals an interesting property of the quantizers found through numerical search: there exists at least one quantization region that consists of one or two elements only. What this ﬁnding implies is that in order to reduce the number of tests as much as possible, a sufﬁcient amount of qualitative information has to be preserved. For example, by having a quantizer that assigns the value v only to inputs of value v, allows for resolving a large amount of uncertainty. Furthermore, the most informative input, left unaltered after\n7 r0.34 0.25 0.41s t0, 1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , 6ut7, 8ut9, 10, ¨ ¨ ¨ , 14u 8 r0.10 0.80 0.10s t0, 1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , 7ut8ut9, 10, ¨ ¨ ¨ , 16u\n9 r0.09 0.82 0.09s t0, 1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , 8ut9ut10, 11, ¨ ¨ ¨ , 18u 10 r0.58 0.28 0.14s t0, 1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , 4ut5, 6ut7, 8, ¨ ¨ ¨ , 20u\nquantization, corresponds to a statistical average of the input symbols, reminiscent to the centroid of a quantization region. These ﬁndings will be discussed in more detail in the full version of the paper.\nDisjunct codes were ﬁrst introduced in [8] for efﬁcient zero- error group testing reconstruction. In what follows, we deﬁne a new family of disjunct codes suitable for SQGT that shares many of the properties of binary disjunct codes.\nDeﬁnition 3: The syndrome of a set of vectors tx i u, i P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , su, such that x i P rqs n , is a vector y P rQs n equal to y \u201c Æ s j \u201c1 x j .\nDeﬁnition 4: A set of codewords X \u201c tx 1 , x 2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , x s u with syndrome y X is said to be included in another set of codewords Z \u201c tz 1 , z 2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , z t u with syndrome y Z , if @i P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , nu, y Xi § y Zi . We denote this inclusion property by X C Z or equivalently y X C y Z .\nRemark 1: By this deﬁnition, it can be easily veriﬁed that if X Ñ Z, then X C Z.\nNote that for q \u201c 2, this deﬁnition is equivalent to the deﬁnition of inclusion for conventional GT, deﬁned in [8].\nDeﬁnition 5: A code is called a rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code of length n and size N if @s, t § u and for any sets of q-ary codewords X \u201c tx 1 , x 2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , x s u and Z \u201c tz 1 , z 2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , z t u, X C Z implies X Ñ Z.\nHenceforth, we focus on the case where the thresholds are equidistant. We call such codes rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct codes. Proposition 1: A code is rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct if and only if no codeword is included in the set of u other codewords.\nProof: It is easy to verify that if a code is rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ- disjunct, then no codeword is included in the set of u other codewords.\nConversely, let X \u201c tx 1 , x 2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , x s u and Z \u201c tz 1 , z 2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , z t u be two sets of codewords where s, t § u. From the assumption that no codeword is included in the set of u other codewords, one can conclude that no codeword is included in the set of t other codewords when t § u. If X CZ\nbut X Ü Z, then there exists a codeword x j (j P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , su) such that tx j u Ü Z. But since tx j u C X C Z, then tx j u C Z, which contradicts the assumption that no codeword is included in t other codewords.\nRemark 2: From Proposition 1, one can conclude that a code is rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct if and only if for any set of u ` 1 codewords, tx 1 , x 2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , x u `1 u, there exists a unique coordinate kpiq in each codeword x i , for which\n. \t (10) By unique coordinate, we mean that kpiq \u2030 kpjq, if i \u2030 j. Consequently, a necessary condition for the existence of a rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code is that q ´ 1 \u2022 ⌘. As a re- sult, there exist no binary r2; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code when ⌘ ° 1.\nProposition 2: Any code generated by multiplying a conven- tional binary u-disjunct code by q ´ 1, where q ´ 1 \u2022 ⌘ 1 , is a rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code. As a result, the rate of the best rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code is at least as large as the rate of the best binary u-disjunct code with the same size and length.\nOur interest in SQ-disjunct codes lies in their simple de- coding procedures, of complexity OpnNq. However, one can construct codes for SQGT using other GT codes, such as binary u-separable codes for conventional GT [8] or codes designed for the adder channel [12]. It can be shown that any of these two family of codes can be multiplied by ⌘ to form a code for SQGT.\nRemark 3: The constructions described in this section reveal the following, and highly intuitive fact: the number of indi- viduals that may be successfully examined with Q-ary SQGT may be as large as the number of individuals that may be tested under the adder channel model, provided that one is allowed to pool different amounts of sample material in each test. In other words, the rate of adder and SGQT channels may be the same, despite the loss of information induced by the quantizer, provided that the alphabet size of the latter scheme is sufﬁciently larger than the alphabet size of the former scheme.\nIn what follows, we discuss two approaches for constructing SQGT codes. For simplicity, we focus on SQGT codes with equidistant thresholds. The ﬁrst approach relies on classical combinatorial methods, while the second approach relies on probabilistic methods. The second approach is of special interest for applications such as genotyping, where one cannot arbitrarily choose the test matrices. The tests are usually determined by the physics of the experiment, and only certain statistical properties of the tests are known. In this scenario, \u201cstructure\u201d is to be seen as probabilistic trait. We show that one way to approach this problem is to characterize the number of tests that ensures that almost all members of a code family possess a given trait and act as SQGT codes.\nFix a binary u-disjunct code matrix C b of dimensions n b ˆ N b , with code-length n b and N b codewords. Let K \u201c\nn \u201c n b and size N \u201c KN b by concatenating K matrices, C \u201c rC 1 , C 2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , C K s, where C j \u201c\nC b , 1 § j § K.\nTheorem 2: Let the concatenated code C be as described above. The code is capable of uniquely identifying up to u positives.\nProof: The proof is based on exhibiting a decoding proce- dure and showing that the procedure allows for distinguishing between any two different sets of positives. The decoder is described below.\nLet y be the Q-ary vector of test outcomes, or equivalently, the syndrome of the positives. For a rational vector z, let tzu and xzy denote the vector of integer parts of z and fractional parts of z, respectively. If u \u201c 1, decoding reduces to ﬁnding the column of C equal to ⌘y. If u ° 1, decoding proceeds as follows.\nStep 1: Set y 1 K \u201c y and form vectors y j , 1 § j § K, using the rules:\n, \t (11) and\n. \t (12) Step 2: Identify the positives as follows: if the syndrome\nof a column of C j is included in y j , declare the subject corresponding to that column positive. Declare the subject negative otherwise.\nThe result is obviously true for u \u201c 1. Therefore, we focus on the case u ° 1. First, using induction, one can prove that each y j , 1 § j § K, is the syndrome of a subset of columns of C j corresponding to positives. Let C 1 j \u201c rC 1 , C 2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , C j s, where 1 § j § K. Since the non-zero entries of C are multiples of ⌘, ⌘y is the sum of columns of C corresponding to a subset of positives. Also, the maximum value of the entries of C 1 K ´1 equals ⌘ u K ´1 ´1 u ´1 . Since there are at most u positives, the maximum value of their sum does not exceed ⌘ u K ´u u ´1 . This bound is strictly smaller than ⌘ u K ´1 u ´1 , the minimum non- zero entry of C K . As a result, y K is the syndrome of the positives with signatures in C K , and y 1 K ´1 is the syndrome of positives with signatures in C 1 K ´1 . Similarly, it can be shown that @j, 1 § j § K ´ 1, y j is the syndrome of the positives with signature in C j , and y 1 j ´1 is the syndrome of the positives with signatures in C 1 j ´1 .\nFrom Proposition 2, we know that each C j is a rq; Q; ⌘; us- SQ-disjunct code. Consequently using step 2, one can uniquely identify the positives with signatures from C j .\nRemark 4: The method described above can be used with any binary separable code for conventional GT or adder channel to generate a SQGT code.\nRemark 5: All the constructions described in this paper are able to identify up to u positives in a pool of N subjects when u ! N. However, when 0 § u § N, one can construct non-binary codes with length n and asymptotic size of N \u201e ptlogt q ´1 ⌘ uu ` log n{2qn (see the full version of this paper).\nWe consider the following problem: ﬁnd a critical rate such that any randomly generated q-ary code with rate less than the critical rate is a rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code with probability close to one. Based on the critical rate, which depends on the statistical properties of the process used to generate the codes, one can identify the smallest number of tests required to ensure that any code in the family may be used for SGGT.\nand I \u201c t q ´1 ⌘ u. Any q-ary code of length n and size N with rate asymptotically satisfying R § R critical is a rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ- disjunct code with probability at least 1 ´ ✏.\nProof: Let C be a code of length n and size N, and let M be a set of u ` 1 codewords of C. There are L \u201c ` N u `1 ˘ different ways to choose M. For the i th choice of M, we deﬁne E i as the event that the syndrome of at least one of the codewords in M is included in the syndrome of the other u codewords. Suppose that P pE i q § p 1 for all i; using the union bound, P ´î L i \u201c1 E i ¯ § Lp 1 . Therefore, if\np 1 § ✏ L , \t (13) then P ´ì L i \u201c1 ¯ E i ¯ \u2022 1 ´ ✏, where ¯ E i is the complement of the event E i . In other words, C is a rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code with probability at least 1 ´ ✏.\n1 q that do not satisfy (10) and have distinct columns; also, pu`1q! ` q n u `1 ˘ is the total number of n ˆpu`1q matrices with distinct columns. In order to ﬁnd an upper bound on a, we use the fact that a matrix that satisﬁes (10) has distinct columns. Consequently,\n´ a \u201c q n pu`1q ´ b \t (14) where q n pu`1q is the number of q-ary matrices with (possibly) repeated columns, and b is the number of such matrices that satisfy (10).
