In the case where each user is in error, the criteria given in [2] closely resembles that of the classical NVD condition used in single user case. This criteria would give us a natural goal if we would like to build DMT achieving codes. Unfortunately in [5] it was proved that this criteria is too tight in the case where the codes of the single users are lattice space-time codes. The pigeon hole bound in [5] proves that, irrespective of the code design, the determinants of the overall code matrices will decay with a polynomial speed.\nIn [3] it was proved that the two user single antenna code (BB-code) given in [10] do achieve the pigeon hole bound. In this paper we are giving a wast generalization of BB-code to general MAC-MIMO. The codes we will build fulﬁll the so called generalized rank criteria and do reach the pigeon hole bound. Our method will share the basic structure with the original generalization of BB-code given in [9].\nThe single user codes we are using are based on the multi- block codes from division algebras [6]. This approach has been taken in several recent papers on MIMO-MAC. However, in these papers the full rank criteria has been achieved by using either transcendental elements [9] (with exception of n t = 2 case, which is dealt with algebraic elements having low degree) or algebraic elements with high degree [4]. Both of these methods make it extremely difﬁcult to measure the decay of the codes and likely lead to bad decay.\nInstead of the usual algebraic independence strategy we will use valuation theory to achieve the full rank condition. This technical tool allows us to use algebraic elements with low degree. By applying Galois theoretic method of Lu et al. [5] and methods from Diophantine approximation, originally introduced by Lahtonen et al. in [3], we will prove that our codes achieve good decay and in particular reach the pigeon hole bound.\nAs a warm up we discuss, when it is possible to achieve the generalized full rank condition for two users, each having a single transmit antenna. In particular these results clarify the construction of BB-code in [10]. Then in Section IV we will give our general construction and state that such an construction always exists and that each code does fulﬁll the generalized rank criteria. In Section V we analyze the decay of the constructed codes. In particular Theorem 5.4 gives a general lower bound and Corollary 5.5 shows that our codes achieves the pigeon hole bound. In the last section we give few explicit examples of our codes.\nIn this paper we are considering MIMO MAC code design in the Rayleigh ﬂat fading channel. We suppose that we have U users, each having n t antennas and that the receiver has n r antennas and complete channels state information. We also suppose that the fading for each user stays stable for U n t time units. Let us refer to the channel matrix of the ith user with H i ∈ M n r ×n t and let us suppose that each of these have i.i.d complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance as coefﬁcients. In this scenario the base station receives\nwhere, X i ∈ M n t ×Un t (C), is the transmitted codeword from the ith user, and N ∈ M n r ×n t U (C) presents the noise having i.i.d complex Gaussian random variables as coefﬁcients.\nIn this scenario multiuser MIMO signal is a U n t × Un t matrix where the rows (j − 1)n t + 1, (j − 1)n t + 2, . . . , (j − 1)n t + n t represent jth user\u2019s signal (j = 1, . . . , U ).\nWe suppose that each user applies a lattice space-time code L j ⊆ M n t ×Un t , j = 1, . . . , U . We also assume that each user\u2019s lattice is of full rank r = 2U n 2 t , and denote the basis of the lattice L j by B j,1 , . . . , B j,r . Now the code associated with the jth user is a restriction of lattice L j\nUsing these deﬁnitions the U -user MIMO MAC code is (L 1 (N 1 ), L 2 (N 2 ), . . . , L U (N U )).\nThis is called the decay function. In the special case N 1 = . . . = N U = N we write\nIf we have a U -user code with decay function D(N 1 , . . . , N n ), such that D(N 1 , . . . , N n ) ̸= 0 for all N 1 , . . . , N U ∈ Z + , we say that the code satisﬁes (gener- alized) rank criterion.\nIn [10] Badr and Belﬁore introduced a 2-user single antenna MAC code where the matrix coefﬁcients were from the ﬁeld Q(i,\ntion of when their construction method leads to codes with generalized full rank property.\nBy O L we mean the ring of integers of ﬁeld L and O ∗ L is the ring of integers of L without zero element.\nTheorem 3.1: Let K/Q and L/K be two ﬁeld extensions of degree 2 and a, b, c, d ∈ L. Let also σ be the non-trivial element in the Galois group Gal(L/K). Deﬁne\nThere exists a matrix in C with zero determinant if and only if\nwhere the function N = N L/K denotes the norm of extension L/K.\nax bσ(x) cy dσ(y)\nwith zero determinant. This means that adxσ(y) = bcσ(x)y, which gives N (a)N (d)N (x)N (σ(y)) \t = N (b)N (c)N (σ(x))N (y). Continuing we get N (a)N (d) = N (b)N (c) i.e. N (a)N (d) − N(b)N(c) = 0.\nAssume then that N (a)N (d) − N(b)N(c) = 0. If b or c is zero then N (a)N (d) = 0 i.e. a or d is zero and then for all x, y ∈ O L we have\nOtherwise N ( ad bc ) = 1. Then by Hilbert 90 we have some z ∈ L such that ad bc = σ(z) z . Then write z = w n with w ∈ O ∗ L and n ∈ Z. This gives ad bc = σ(w) w i.e. adw − bcσ(w) = 0. This means that the determinant of (\naw bσ(w) c1 dσ(1)\nA. Construction of U -user code for n t transmission antennas From now on we concentrate on the scenario where we\nhave U ∈ Z + users and each user has n t ∈ Z + transmission antennas. Throughout this section we assume K to be an imaginary quadratic extension of Q with class number 1, L is a cyclic Galois extension of K of degree U n t , such that L = K(α) with α ∈ R, σ a generating element in Gal(L/K) and p ∈ O K an inert prime in L/K. We also deﬁne τ = σ U and F to be the ﬁxed ﬁeld of τ . So we have [L : F ] = n t , [F : K] = U , Gal(L/F ) =< τ >, and Gal(F/K) =< σ F >\nwhere σ F is a restriction of σ in F . Let v = v p be the p- adic valuation of the ﬁeld L. In this section, when we say that L/K, p, and σ are suitable we mean that they are as above.\nDue to the space limitations, we skip the proof of the following proposition.\nProposition 4.1: For every complex quadratic ﬁeld K, hav- ing class number 1, and for any U and for any n t we have a suitable degree n t U extension L/K, prime p ∈ O K and automorphism σ ∈ Gal(L/K).\nNow we are ready for our construction. Let x j ∈ O L for all j = 1, . . . , n t . Deﬁne M = M (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n t ) to be\n        \nx 1 \t pτ (x n t ) pτ 2 (x n t −1 ) . . . pτ n t −1 (x 2 ) x 2 \t τ (x 1 ) \t pτ 2 (x n t ) . . . pτ n t −1 (x 3 ) x 3 \t τ (x 2 ) \t τ 2 (x 1 ) \t . . . pτ n −1 (x 4 )\n        \ni.e. a matrix representation of an element in the cyclic algebra (L/F, τ, p). The following lemma proves that (L/F, τ, p) is a division algebra.\nLemma 4.2: Let x j ∈ O L for all j = 1, . . . , n t such that x l ̸= 0 for some l and min(v(x 1 ), . . . , v(x n t )) = 0. Then we have\nProof: Write M = M (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n t ) and N = N L/F . Assume ﬁrst that v(x 1 ) = 0. Then the determinant is N (x 1 ) + py for some y ∈ O L and hence we have v(det(M )) = min(v(N (x 1 )), v(py)) = 0. Assume then that v(x 1 ), v(x 2 ), . . . , v(x l −1 ) > 0 and v(x l ) = 0 with 1 < l ≤ n t . Notice that in this case all the other elements a of matrix M than those in the left lower corner block of side length n t − l + 1 have v(a) > 0. Either they have coefﬁcient p or they are automorphic images of elements x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x l −1 . Now det(M ) = ±p l −1 N (x l ) + p l z for some z ∈ O L since all the other terms except ±p l −1 N (x l ) have at most n t − l factors from this left lower corner and hence at least n t − (n t − l) = l terms have factor p. This gives that v(det(M )) = min(v(p l −1 N (x l )), v(p l z)) = l − 1 ≤ n t − 1.\nDeﬁnition 4.1: Deﬁne M j = M (x j,1 , x j,2 , . . . , x j,n t ) for all j = 1, . . . , U . In our multi access system the code C j of jth user consists of n t × Un t matrices B j =\nand x j,l ̸= 0 for some l. Here k is same for all users. The the whole code C U,n t consists of matrices\n    \n  \nwhere B j ∈ C j for all i = 1, . . . , U . This means that the matrices A ∈ C U,n t have form\n    \np −k M 1 \t σ(M 1 ) \t . . . \t σ U −1 (M 1 ) M 2 \t p −k σ(M 2 ) . . . \t σ U −1 (M 2 )\n  \nWe will skip the proof of the following proposition, stating that each of the single user codes satisﬁes the NVD condition and are therefore DMT optimal.\nProposition 4.3: Let C U,n t ∈ C U,n t and C j be the jth users code in the system C U,n t for some j ∈ 1, . . . , U. Then the code C j is a 2U n 2 t -dimensional lattice code with the NVD property.\nThe code depends on how we did choose L/K, p, σ, and k, so to be precise, we can also refer to C U,n t with C U,n t (L/K, p, σ, k). Let us call the family of all such codes C U,n t (L/K, p, σ, k) (i.e. codes constructed with any suitable L/K, p, σ, and k) by C U,n t . That is\nAccording to Proposition 4.1 we can always ﬁnd suitable L/K, p, σ, and k for any U ∈ Z + and n t ∈ Z + . We therefore have the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.4: For any choice of U ∈ Z + and n t ∈ Z + we have C U,n ̸= ∅.\nNote that the code C U,1 = C U,1 (L/K, p, σ, 1) ∈ C U,1 , a code for U users each having one transmission antenna, consists of matrices of form\n      \np −1 x 1 \t σ(x 1 ) \t σ 2 (x 1 ) \t . . . \t σ U −1 (x 1 ) x 2 \t p −1 σ(x 2 ) \t σ 2 (x 2 ) \t . . . \t σ U −1 (x 2 ) x 3 \t σ(x 3 ) \t p −1 σ 2 (x 3 ) . . . \t σ U −1 (x 3 )\n    \nNote also that the code C 1,n t = C 1,n t (L/K, p, σ, k) ∈ C 1,n t is a usual single user code multiplied by p −k .\nTheorem 4.5: Let C U,n t ∈ C U,n t . The code C U,n t is a full rate code and satisﬁes the generalized rank criterion.\nProof: Let A ∈ C U,n t = C U,n t (L/K, p, σ, k). We may assume that min(v(x j,1 ), . . . , v(x j,n t )) = 0, for all j = 1, . . . , U , because otherwise we can divide extra p\u2019s off. That does not have any impact on whether det(A) = 0 or not. The determinant of A is\nwhere v(y) \t ≥ \t −k(Un t − 2). We know that v(σ l −1 (det(M l ))) = v(det(M l )) because p is from K, i.e. from the ﬁxed ﬁeld of σ, and det(M l ) ̸= 0 for all l. Therefore\nthat is less or equal than −kUn t +U (n t −1) = U(n t −1−kn t ) by 4.2. But if we would have det(A) = 0 then\nand hence v(y) ≤ U(n t − 1 − kn t ) implying −k(Un t − 2) ≤ U (n t − 1 − kn t ). This gives 2k ≤ U(n t − 1) i.e. k ≤ U (n t −1) 2 a contradiction.\nRemark 4.1: Using multiblock codes from division algebras as single user codes in the MIMO MAC scenario has been used before for example in [10], [4] and [5]. In [10] the full rank condition for codes with n t > 1 is achieved by using transcendental elements. In [4] the same effect is achieved with algebraic elements of high degree.\nIn this section we will prove an asymptotic lower bound for the decay function of codes from C U,n t . In [3] the authors give a general asymptotic upper bound for a decay function in the case that only one user is properly using the code i.e. N 1 can be anything but N 2 = · · · = N U = 1 are restricted. We will see that in this special case our codes have asymptotically the best possible decay.\nLemma 5.1: Let C U,n t = C U,n t (L/K, p, σ, k) ∈ C U,n t , A ∈ C U,n t , and let F be the ﬁxed ﬁeld of τ = σ U . Then det(A) ∈ F .\nProof: As F is the ﬁxed ﬁeld of τ it is enough to prove that τ (det(A)) = det(A). Write again M j = M (x j,1 , x j,2 , . . . , x j,n t ) and notice that τ (M j ), after switching ﬁrst and last column and ﬁrst and last row, is\n      \npx j,2 \t τ (x j,1 ) \t pτ 2 (x j,n t ) . . . pτ n t −1 (x j,3 ) px j,3 \t τ (x j,2 ) \t τ 2 (x j,1 ) . . . pτ n t −1 (x j,4 )\n    \nHere we did an even number of row and column changes so when calling the above matrix M \u2032 j we see that τ (det(A)) is\np −k M \u2032 1 \t σ(M \u2032 1 ) \t σ 2 (M \u2032 1 ) \t . . . \t σ n −1 (M \u2032 1 ) M \u2032 2 \t p −k σ(M \u2032 2 ) \t σ 2 (M \u2032 2 ) \t . . . \t σ n −1 (M \u2032 2 ) M \u2032 3 \t σ(M \u2032 3 ) \t p −k σ 2 (M \u2032 3 ) . . . \t σ n −1 (M \u2032 3 )\nLet us call the above matrix A \u2032 . We notice that matrices A and A \u2032 are exactly similar apart from the fact that in M j elements in places (1, 2), (1, 3), . . . , (1, n t ) have coefﬁcient p −k and elements in places (2, 1), (3, 1), . . . , (n t , 1) have not coefﬁcient p −k and in M \u2032 j these are vice versa. But this does not change the value of the determinant because in the expansion of the determinant each summand include a product of same number of elements from columns that are congruent to 1 modulo n t and from rows that are congruent to 1 modulo n t .\nTheorem 5.2: [7] For any full-rate U -user lattice code, each user transmitting with n t antennas there exists a constant k > 0 such that\nFor the next theorem we need few deﬁnitions. Let p(x) = p 0 + p 1 x + · · · + p m x m ∈ Z[x] be a polynomial. Then we say that H(p(x)) = max {|p j |} is the height of the polynomial p(x) and for an algebraic number α we deﬁne H(α) = H(ϕ α ) where ϕ α is the minimal polynomial of α. The next generalization of Liouville\u2019s theorem can be found from [8, p. 31].\nTheorem 5.3: Let α ∈ R be an algebraic number of degree κ, H(α) ≤ h, H(P ) ≤ H and deg(P (x)) = m ∈ Z + . Then either P (α) = 0 or\nNow we are ready to give a lower bound for the decay function of our codes. The proof can be seen as an extension to the analysis given for BB-code in [3].\nTheorem 5.4: For a code C U,n t ∈ C U,n t there exists con- stant K > 0 such that\nProof: Let C U,n t = C U,n t (L/K, p, σ, k). Field ex- tension L/Q has a basis S 1 ∪ S 2 where S 1 = {1, δ, δ 2 , . . . , δ U −1 , β, βδ, βδ 2 , . . . , βδ U −1 } is a basis of F/Q with δ ∈ R, K = Q(β) and β =\nThe ring O L has a Z-basis {γ 1 , . . . , γ 2U n t }. Each of these basis elements can be presented as\nwhere s l,a ∈ Q for all l = 1, . . . , 2Un t and a ∈ S 1 ∪ S 2 . Let A ∈ C U,n be\n    \np −k M 1 \t σ(M 1 ) \t . . . \t σ U −1 (M 1 ) M 2 \t p −k σ(M 2 ) . . . \t σ U −1 (M 2 )\n    \nand M j = M (x j,1 , x j,2 , . . . , x j,n t ) be       \nx j,1 pτ (x j,n t ) pτ 2 (x j,n t −1 ) . . . pτ n t −1 (x j,2 ) x j,2 \t τ (x j,1 ) \t pτ 2 (x j,n t ) . . . pτ n t −1 (x j,3 ) x j,3 \t τ (x j,2 ) \t τ 2 (x j,1 ) \t . . . pτ n t −1 (x j,4 )\n      \nThen the determinant det(A) is a sum consisting of U n t ! elements of form\nwhere f ≤ kUn t and m j gets exactly n t times all the values 1, . . . , U and h j gets values from {1, . . . , n t }.\ns l,a a gives that the determinant is a sum consisting of elements of form\ns l,a σ j (a)) can be written as a sum of elements of form\nwhere K 1 ∈ Q is some constant, u a ∈ Z, and u a = O((N 1 . . .

In table Table 1 we have collected some examples of suitable ﬁelds K and L and inert primes p, fulﬁlling the conditions of Proposition 4.1. If K = Q(i) then p i O K refers to the inert prime and if K = Q(\n−3 O K is inert. The inert primes and ﬁelds L are found by looking at totally real subﬁelds of Q(ζ m )/Q and then composing them with the ﬁeld K.\nWe get a code C 3,1 = C 3,1 (Q(i, ζ 7 + ζ −1 7 ), 2 + i, σ, 1) i.e. 3-user code with each user having 1 antenna by setting L = K(ζ 7 + ζ −1 7 ), K = Q(i), p = 2 + i, and Gal(L/K) =< σ >. Now the actual code consists of matrices \n \nantennas by setting L = K(ζ 17 + ζ 4 17 + ζ −4 17 + ζ −1 17 ), K = Q(\n, and Gal(L/K) =< σ >.

As a corollary we got that all our codes do achieve the pigeon hole bound.\nThe research of T. Ernvall is supported in part by the Academy of Finland grant 131745. The research of R.
