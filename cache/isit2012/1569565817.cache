Their cyclic structure allows among other things efﬁcient decoding methods. For many cyclic codes, the minimum distance is not known, and hence we will investigate the minimum Hamming distance of q-ary cyclic codes in this contribution.\nThe Bose\u2013Ray-Chaudhuri\u2013Hocquenghem (BCH, [1], [2]) bound uses the longest consecutive sequence in the deﬁning set of the code to bound the minimum distance. Its general- ization, the Hartmann\u2013Tzeng (HT, [3], [4]) bound, is based on several consecutive sets of zeros. Further generalizations are the contributions of Roos [5], [6], van Lint and Wilson [7], Duursma and K¨otter [8] and Duursma and Pellikaan [9]. Other approaches include the Boston bounds [10] and the bound by Betti and Sala [11].\nOur approach uses a second cyclic code \u2014 the non-zero- locator code \u2014 to describe the deﬁning set of the cyclic code which allows to bound its minimum distance. It turns out that a good bound on the minimum distance is achieved, if the non-zero-locator code has low rate and a small distance.\nThis contribution is a generalization of our previous work [12], [13], where we used the power series expansion of a fraction of two co-prime polynomials and associated it with the code. The advantage of this extension is that we can directly use well-known properties of cyclic codes to describe another cyclic code rather than abstract properties of power series expansions. Further, this contribution is a generalization of [12], [13] since the non-zero-locator code can be seen as a sum of several power series expansions.\nOur contribution is structured as follows. We introduce necessary preliminaries of q-ary cyclic codes in Section II and recall the HT bound. Section III gives the deﬁnition of\nthe non-zero-locator code and proves the main theorem on the minimum distance. Single parity check and cyclic Reed\u2013 Solomon codes are used as non-zero-locator codes and the connection to the HT bound is shown in Section IV. Section V concludes this contribution.\nLet q be a power of a prime, let F q denote the ﬁnite ﬁeld of order q and let F q [x] denote the set of all univariate polynomials with coefﬁcients in F q and indeterminate x. A q-ary cyclic code C over F q of length n, dimension k and minimum distance d is denoted by C(q; n, k, d). A codeword c(x) = n−1 i=0 c i x i of C(q; n, k, d) is a multiple of its generator polynomial g(x) ∈ F q [x] with roots in F q s , where n | (q s −1). Let α ∈ F q s be a primitive nth root of unity. A cyclotomic coset M r is given by:\nwhere n r is the smallest integer such that rq n r ≡ r mod n. It is well-known that the minimal polynomial M r (x) ∈ F q [x] of the element α r is given by\nThe deﬁning set D C of a q-ary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) is the set containing the indices of the zeros of the generator polynomial g(x) and can be partitioned into m cyclotomic cosets:\nD C def = {i : g(α i ) = 0} = M r 1 ∪ M r 2 ∪ · · · ∪ M r m . (3) Hence, the generator polynomial g(x) ∈ F q [x] of degree n − k of C(q; n, k, d) is\nLet us recall a well-known bound on the minimum distance of cyclic codes.\nTheorem 1 (Hartmann\u2013Tzeng (HT) Bound, [3]) Let a q- ary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) with the deﬁning set D C be given. Suppose there exist the integers b 1 , m 1 and m 2 with gcd(n, m 1 ) = 1 and gcd(n, m 2 ) = 1 such that\nNote that for ν = 0 the HT bound becomes the BCH bound [1], [2]. A further generalization was proposed by Roos [5], [6] and van Lint and Wilson [7]. Decoding up to the HT and the Roos bound was formulated by Feng and Tzeng [14, Section VI].\nWe consider cyclic Reed\u2013Solomon (RS) codes [15] for our approach and therefore recapitulate their deﬁnition in the following.\nDeﬁnition 1 (Cyclic Reed\u2013Solomon Code) Let n be an in- teger dividing q − 1 and let α denote an element of multiplica- tive order n in F q . Let δ be an integer. Furthermore, let the generator polynomial g δ (x) ∈ F q [x] be deﬁned as:\nThen, a cyclic Reed\u2013Solomon code over F q of length n | q − 1 and dimension k, denoted by RS(q; n, k; δ), is deﬁned by:\nRS codes are maximum distance separable codes and their minimum distance d is d = n − k + 1.\nWe extend our earlier approach [12], [13], where we asso- ciated a power series expansion of a fraction of two co-prime polynomials with the zeros of a cyclic code. Now, we connect another cyclic code \u2014 the so-called non-zero-locator code \u2014 to a given cyclic code.\nLet us establish a connection between the codewords of a cyclic code and the sum of power series expansions. Let c(x) be a codeword of a given q-ary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) and let the set Y denote the set of indices of nonzero coefﬁcients of c(x)\nLet α be an element of order n. Then, we have the following relation for all c(x) ∈ C(q; n, k, d):\nDeﬁnition 2 (Non-Zero-Locator Code) Let a q-ary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) be given. Let α denote an nth root of unity. Let gcd(n, n ) = 1 and let β be an n th root of unity. Then, L(q ; n , k , d ) is a non-zero-locator code of C if there exists a µ ≥ 0 and an integer e, such that ∀ a(x) ∈ L and ∀ c(x) ∈ C:\nBefore we prove the main theorem on the minimum distance of a cyclic code C, we describe Deﬁnition 2. We search the \u201clongest\u201d sequence\nthat results in a zero-sequence of length µ−1, i.e., the product of the evaluated codeword a(β j ) of the non-zero-locator code L and the evaluated codeword c(α j+e ) of C gives zero for all j = 0, . . . , µ − 2.\nWe require a root β j of the non-zero-locator code L at the position j where the cyclic code C has no zero.\nthat we use for the degree calculation in the following. For the proof we refer to [12, Lemma 1]. We rewrite the expression of Deﬁnition 2 with (5) more explicitly. Let Z denote the set of indexes of nonzero coefﬁcients of a(x) ∈ L.\nwhere the degree of the denominator is exactly |Y| · |Z| due to (6). The degree of the numerator is smaller than or equal to (|Y| − 1) · |Z| + |Z| − 1. In the following we assume that the degree of the numerator is (|Y|−1)·|Z|+|Z|−1 = |Y|·|Z|−1.\nThis leads to the following theorem on the minimum distance of a cyclic code C.\nTheorem 2 (Minimum Distance) Let a q-ary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) with the associated non-zero-locator code L(q ; n , k , d ) and the integers µ and e be given with\n0 \t 2 \t 4 \t 6 \t 8 \t 10 \t 12 \t 14 \t 16 \t 18 \t 20 0 1 2 3\ngcd(n, n ) = 1, such that (7) holds. Then, the minimum distance d of C(q; n, k, d) satisﬁes the following inequality:\nd ≥ d ∗ def = µ d\nProof: For a codeword c(x) ∈ C(q; n, k, d) of weight d and codeword a(x) ∈ L(q ; n , k , d ) of weight d , the degree of the denominator in (2) is d · d . The numerator has degree at most d · d − 1, and has to be greater than or equal to µ − 1.\nthe binary cyclic code C(2; 21, 7, 8) with generator polynomial g(x)\ng(x) = M (21) 1 (x) · M (21) 3 (x) · M (21) 7 (x) · M (21) 9 (x) be given.\nThe deﬁning set D C = M (21) 1 ∪ M (21) 3 ∪ M (21) 7 ∪ M (21) 9 of C(2; 21, 7, 8) is:\nWe associate a single parity check code of length n = 5, k = 4 distance d = 2 as non-zero-locator code for C(2; 21, 7, 8) according to Deﬁnition 2. For e = 0 the subset of the deﬁning set of C(2; 21, 7, 8) and L(2 4 ; 5, 4, 2) is listed in Table I, where the product gives the a zero-sequence of length 13. The codewords a(x) ∈ L(2 4 ; 5, 4, 2) \u201cﬁll\u201d the missing zeros of C(2; 21, 7, 8) at position 0, 5 and 10 in the interval [0, 12]. We have µ − 1 = 13 and therefore d ∗ = (14)/2 = 7. The HT bound with parameters b 1 = 1, m 1 = 5, d 0 = 3 and m 2 = 1, ν = 3 gives also a lower bound of 7 and the Roos bound gives 8 [7], which is the minimum distance of C(2; 21, 7, 8).\nThe optimal non-zero-locator code L for a cyclic code gives a zero sequence\nof length µ − 1 as in Deﬁnition 2, such that d ∗ of (8) is maximized.\nIf we require a small cardinality of the deﬁning set D C , the cardinality of the deﬁning set D L of the non-zero-locator code should be large to obtain a long zero-sequence and therefore L should have a low rate k /n . On the other hand, the distance d of the non-zero-locator code L should be small.\nLet us rewrite the HT bound as given in Theorem 1. We multiply with the inverse of m 2 modulo n. Let C(q; n, k, d) be a q-ary cyclic code with the deﬁning set D C . Let\nNote that m > ν + 1. We refer to this representation of the HT bound in this section. In the following, we consider a single parity check code as non-zero-locator code and outline the connection to a particular case of the HT bound. The general case is then considered in Subsection IV-C, where cyclic RS codes are used as non-zero-locator codes.\nLet a q-ary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) with a subset of its deﬁning set with parameters d 0 > 2 and ν > 0 be given as stated in (9). Furthermore, let m = ν + 2.\n0 \t 2 \t 4 \t 6 \t 8 \t 10 \t 12 \t 14 \t 16 \t 18 \t 20 0 1 2 3\nWe associate a binary single parity check code as non-zero- locator code. Let L(2; n , n − 1, 2) be the cyclic non-zero- locator code with generator polynomial g(x) = x − 1. We assume gcd(n, n ) = 1 for the given cyclic code C(q; n, k, d). We illustrate the set of zeros of the cyclic non-zero-locator code L, i.e., a single parity check code, for the cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) in Table III. A represents the existence of a non-zero of the corresponding code C or L. The sequence is illustrated in terms of parameters of the HT bound as in (9). The considered code C has d 0 − 1 sets of ν + 1 consecutive zeros, separated by one non-zero. The non-zero-locator code ﬁlls exactly this one non-zero.\nThe parameters of the non-zero-locator code L(2; n , k , d ) are:\n− 1) + 2 2\nIn Fig. 1 we illustrate d ∗ of (10) for different parameters ν and d 0 of the HT bound.\nConsider a cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) with the deﬁning set D C and let\nFurthermore let gcd(n, 3) = 1. We associate a cyclic single parity check code of length n = 3 with C and illustrate the corresponding zero-sequence in Table IV. The zero-sequence has length µ − 1 = 13 and we obtain d ∗ = (14)/2 = 7. The HT bound gives for b 2 = −5, m = 3 and d 0 = 5, ν = 1\nIn the previous subsection we associated to q-ary cyclic code C, with a subset of its deﬁning set with parameters m 1 = m = ν +2 and m 2 = 1 as stated in Theorem 1, a single parity check code. Now we consider the case were m > ν +2 and associate a RS code to the given q-ary cyclic code.\nLet a q-ary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) with a subset of its deﬁning set with parameters d 0 > 2 and ν > 0 be given as stated in (9). Furthermore, let m > ν + 2.\nIn Table II, the HT bound (9) with i 1 = 0, . . . , d 0 − 2 and i 2 = 0, . . . , ν is illustrated. We choose as non-zero-locator\ncode L(q ; n , k , d ) a cyclic RS code with δ = ν + 1 as in Deﬁnition 1. The parameters are:\nThe m − ν − 1 consecutive zeros of the non-zero-locator code L, i.e., a cyclic RS code of length m, ﬁll the missing zeros of the given cyclic code C(q; n, k, d).

Fig. 2 shows d ∗ of (11) normalized to d 0 + ν for the same parameter ν = 6. We varied the distance d of the non-zero-locator code.\nLet us precise the cases where our bound d ∗ is larger than the Hartmann\u2013Tzeng bound d 0 + ν.\nProposition 1 Let a q-ary cyclic code C with a subset of its deﬁning set with parameters d 0 , ν, m 1 = m and m 2 = 1 as stated in Theorem 1 be given. Let L(q ; m, ν + 1, m − ν) be the associated cyclic RS code as in Deﬁnition 2. Then, for\n− ν m − ν\nFor m − ν = d = 2 the associated RS code is a single parity check code and our bound is better than the HT bound for d 0 > 3 (see Fig. 1). Some other cases, where the distance of the associated RS code m − ν = d is between two and six, are illustrated in Fig. 2.\nWe presented and proved a new bound on the minimum distance of q-ary cyclic codes. The used technique is based on a second cyclic code \u2014 the so-called non-zero-locator code. We used non-zero-locator codes that allow us to connect the Hartmann\u2013Tzeng bound directly with our bound. In detail, we used single parity check codes and RS codes and showed for which parameters our bound improves upon the HT bound.\nFuture work is the decoding up to our bound and the classiﬁcation of cyclic codes, where the non-zero-locator code gives a good bound on the minimum distance.\nThe authors wish to thank Antonia Wachter-Zeh and Daniel Augot for fruitful discussions."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A.
