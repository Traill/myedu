This work is from Steinberg\u2019s work on the degraded broadcast channel with noncausal side in- formation, and Csisz´ ar and K¨orner\u2019s work on broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages. In this new model, the transmitter sends a conﬁdential message to the non-degraded receiver, and meanwhile sends a common message to both the degraded and non-degraded receivers. Moreover, the channel for the non- degraded receiver is controlled by channel state information (side information), and it is available to the transmitter in a noncausal manner (termed here noncausal side information). In addition, we assume that there is a noiseless feedback from the output of the channel for the non-degraded receiver to the transmitter, and it helps them share a secret key, which enlarges the degraded receiver\u2019s uncertainty about the conﬁdential message.\nMeasuring the uncertainty by equivocation (conditional en- tropy), the capacity-equivocation region composed of all achiev- able rates-equivocation triples is determined for this new model.

It is a kind of degraded broadcast channels. The object is to transmit mes- sages to the legitimate receiver, while keeping the wiretapper as ignorant of the messages as possible. After the publication of Wyner\u2019s work, Csisz´ ar and K¨orner [4] investigated a more general situation: the broadcast channels with conﬁdential messages. The model of [4] is to transmit conﬁdential mes- sages to receiver 1 at rate R 1 and common messages to both receivers at rate R 0 , while keeping receiver 2 as ignorant of\nthe conﬁdential messages as possible. Measuring ignorance by equivocation, a single-letter characterization of all the achievable triples (R 1 , R e , R 0 ) was provided in [4], where R e is the second receiver\u2019s equivocation to the conﬁdential messages. Note that the model of [4] is also a generalization of [9], where no conﬁdentiality condition is imposed. In addition, Merhav [12] studied a speciﬁed wiretap channel, and obtained the capacity region, where both the legitimate receiver and the wiretapper have access to some leaked symbols from the source, but the channels for the wiretapper are more noisy than the legitimate receiver, which shares a secret key with the encoder.\nIt is well known that feedback does not increase the capacity of discrete memoryless channel (DMC). However, does the feedback increase the capacity region of the wiretap channel? In order to solve this problem, Ahlswede and Cai studied the general wiretap channel (the wiretap channel does not need to be degraded) with noiseless feedback from the legitimate receiver [1], and both the upper and lower bounds of the secrecy capacity were provided, which were proved to be tight. Speciﬁcally, for the degraded case, they showed that the secrecy capacity is larger than that of Wyner\u2019s wiretap channel (without feedback). Furthermore, the wiretap channel with noisy feedback was studied in [11], and the wiretap channel with secure rate-limited feedback was studied in [2], and both of them focused on bounds of the secrecy capacity.\nThe coding for channels with causal side information at the encoder was ﬁrst investigated by Shannon [14] in 1958. After that, in order to solve the problem of coding for a com- puter memory with defective cells, Kuznetsov and Tsybakov [10] considered a channel in the presence of noncausal side information at the transmitter. They provided some coding techniques without determination of the capacity. The capacity\nwas found in 1980 by Gel\u2019fand and Pinsker [8]. Furthermore, Costa [6] investigated a power constrained additive noise channel, where part of the noise is known at the transmitter as side information. This channel is also called dirty paper channel. Recently, Mitrpant et al. [13] and Chen et al. [3] studied combinations of Costa\u2019s dirty paper channel [6] and the wiretap channel, where both of them focused on achievable regions. In order to introduce side information to the broadcast channel, Steinberg investigated the degraded broadcast channel with side information [15], where both causal and noncausal side information were considered in his paper. Speciﬁcally, in- ner and outer bounds on capacity region were provided for the degraded broadcast channel with noncausal side information [15], meanwhile, the capacity region of the degraded broadcast channel with causal side information was totally determined [15].\nIn this paper, we study the model of degraded broadcast channel with noncausal side information, conﬁdential mes- sages and noiseless feedback. The model of this paper is from Steinberg\u2019s work on degraded broadcast channel with noncausal side information at the encoder, and the model of broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages provided by Csisz´ ar and K¨orner. In this new model, S is the conﬁdential message sent to receiver 1, and T is the common message sent to both receiver 1 and receiver 2. The transition probability of channel 1 (for receiver 1) depends on the side information V N , and V N is available to the channel encoder in a noncausal manner. In addition, there is a noiseless feedback from the output of channel 1 to the transmitter. The receiver 2 can observe a degraded version of the output of channel 1 Y N via channel 2.\nIn Section II, the capacity-equivocation region is determined in Theorem 1. Furthermore, the secrecy capacity is formulated in remark 1, which provides the best transmission rate with perfect secrecy.\nThe converse part of Theorem 1 is shown in Section III. The direct part of Theorem 1 is shown in Section IV, where the feedback is used to generate a secret key shared by the transmitter and receiver 1. Final conclusions are provided in Section V.\nThroughout the paper, random variab1es, sample values and alphabets are denoted by capital letters, lower case letters and calligraphic letters, respectively. A similar convention is applied to the random vectors and their sample values. For example, U N denotes a random N -vector (U 1 , ..., U N ), and u N = (u 1 , ..., u N ) is a speciﬁc vector value in U N that is the N th Cartesian power of U. U N i denotes a random N − i + 1- vector (U i , ..., U N ), and u N i = (u i , ..., u N ) is a speciﬁc vector value in U N i . Let p V (v) denote the probability mass function P r {V = v}.\nIn the remainder of this section, a description of the model of degraded broadcast channel with noncausal side informa- tion, conﬁdential messages and noiseless feedback is given by Deﬁnition 1 to Deﬁnition 5. The capacity-equivocation region\nR ( A) composed of all achievable (R 0 , R 1 , R e ) triples is char- acterized in Theorem 1, where the achievable (R 0 , R 1 , R e ) triple is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 6.\nDeﬁnition 1: (Channel encoder) The conﬁdential message S takes values in S, and the common message T takes values in T . S and T are independent and uniformly distributed over their ranges. V N is the side information of channel 1, and it is the output of a discrete memoryless source p V (v). In addition, V N is available to the channel encoder in a noncausal manner. Note that V N is independent with S and T . The feedback Y i −1 (where 2 ≤ i ≤ N and Y i −1 takes values in Y i −1 ) is the previous i − 1 time output of channel 1. At the i-th time, the inputs of the channel encoder are S, T , Y i −1 and V N , while the output is X i , i.e., the channel encoder is a mapping\nwhere f i (s, t, y i −1 , v N ) = x i ∈ X , s ∈ S, t ∈ T , y i −1 ∈ Y i −1 and v N ∈ V N (note that f i is a stochastic encoder, not deterministic). The transmission rates of the conﬁdential message and the common message are log ∥S∥ N and log ∥T ∥ N , respectively.\nDeﬁnition 2: (Channel 1) Channel 1 is a DMC with ﬁnite input alphabet X × V, ﬁnite output alphabet Y, and transition probability Q 1 (y |x, v), where x ∈ X , v ∈ V, y ∈ Y. Q 1 (y N |x N , v N ) =\nQ 1 (y n |x n , v n ). The inputs of Chan- nel 1 are X N and V N , while the output is Y N .\nDeﬁnition 3: (Channel 2) Channel 2 is a DMC with ﬁnite input alphabet Y, ﬁnite output alphabet Z, and transition probability Q 2 (z |y), where y ∈ Y, z ∈ Z. Q 2 (z N |y N ) = ∏\nQ 2 (z n |y n ). The inputs of Channel 2 is Y N , while the output is Z N . Receiver 2\u2019s equivocation to the conﬁdential message is deﬁned as\nIn this paper, we assume that receiver 2 has no knowledge about the feedback (except his own output Z N ), and this assumption is the same as that of [1].\nDeﬁnition 4: (Decoder 1) Decoder 1 is a mapping f D1 : Y N → S × T , with input Y N and outputs S, T . Let P e1 be the error probability of receiver 1 , and it is deﬁned as P r {(S, T ) ̸= (S, T )}.\nDeﬁnition 5: (Decoder 2) Decoder 2 is a mapping f D2 : Z N → T , with input Z N and output T . Let P e2 be the error probability of receiver 2 , and it is deﬁned as P r {T ̸= T }.\nDeﬁnition 6: (Achievable (R 0 , R 1 , R e ) triple) A triple (R 0 , R 1 , R e ) (where R 0 , R 1 , R e > 0) is called achievable if, for any ϵ > 0 (where ϵ is an arbitrary small positive real number and ϵ → 0), there exists a channel encoder-decoder (N, ∆, P e1 , P e2 ) such that\nTheorem 1 gives a single-letter characterization of the set R ( A) , which is composed of all achievable (R 0 , R 1 , R e ) triples, and it is proved in the remaining sections.\nTheorem 1: A single-letter characterization of the region R ( A) is as follows,\nR ( A) = {(R 0 , R 1 , R e ) : 0 ≤ R e ≤ R 1 , R 0 ≤ I(U; Z) − I(U; V ), R 1 ≤ I(K; Y |U),\nR e ≤ I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z|U) + I(A; V |U), R e ≤ H(Y |Z)},\nand U may be assumed to be a (deterministic) function of A. Remark 1: There are some notes on Theorem 1, see the\nfollowing. The details of the proof are in our full paper, see [7].\n\u2022 The ranges of the random variables U , K and A satisfy ∥U∥ ≤ ∥X ∥∥V∥ + 2,\n\u2022 The points in R ( A) for which R e = R 1 are of consider- able interest, which imply H(S) = H(S |Z N ).\nDeﬁnition 7: (The secrecy capacity region C (A) s ) The secrecy capacity region C (A) s is denoted by\nC (A) s = {(R 0 , R 1 ) : R 0 ≤ I(U; Z) − I(U; V ), R 0 + R 1 ≤ I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ),\nR 1 ≤ I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z|U) + I(A; V |U), R 1 ≤ H(Y |Z)}.\nDeﬁnition 8: (The secrecy capacity C (A) s ) The secrecy capacity C (A) s is denoted by\nC (A) s = max min {I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z|U) +I(A; V |U), I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ),\nThe converse proof of Theorem 1 is a combination of the converse parts of [4] and [8]. Due to the limitation of the paper length, we omit the proof here. The full details of the proof are in our full paper [7].\nIn this section we show the direct part of Theorem 1. Suppose (R 0 , R 1 , R e ) ∈ R A , we will show that (R 0 , R 1 , R e ) is achievable, i.e., for any given ϵ > 0 (where ϵ → 0), there exists a channel encoder-decoder (N, ∆, P e1 , P e2 ) satisﬁes (2.3).\nThe proof of the direct part of Theorem 1 is considered into six cases, see the following.\n(i) I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z|U) + I(A; V |U) ≤ H(Y |Z) ≤ I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ),\n(ii) I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z|U) + I(A; V |U) ≤ I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ) ≤ H(Y |Z),\n(iii) H(Y |Z) ≤ I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z|U) + I(A; V |U) ≤ I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ),\n(iv) H(Y |Z) ≤ I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ) ≤ I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z |U) + I(A; V |U),\n(v) I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ) ≤ I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z|U) + I(A; V |U) ≤ H(Y |Z),\n(vi) I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ) ≤ H(Y |Z) ≤ I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z |U) + I(A; V |U).\nFor (i) and (ii), the direct part of Theorem 1 is proved by the following subcase 1 and subcase 2. For (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi), the direct part of Theorem 1 is proved by the following subcase 3.\n\u2022 (Subcase 1) For case (i) and case (ii), if I(K; Y |U) + I(U ; Z) − I(U; V ) > I(A; Y ) − I(A; V ), an encoding-\ndecoding scheme using feedback is introduced. Specif- ically, the noiseless feedback from receiver 1 to the transmitter is used to generate a shared secret key. Part of the conﬁdential message S is transmitted by the secret key, and the other part of S is transmitted by using a similar method in [4].\n\u2022 (Subcase 2) For case (i) and case (ii), if I(K; Y |U) + I(U ; Z) − I(U; V ) ≤ I(A; Y ) − I(A; V ), there is no\nneed to use feedback to generate a shared secret key, and the proof is similar to the direct part of [4]. Note that for subcase 1 and subcase 2, a sufﬁcient condition of the cor- responding proof is to show that, the (R 0 , R 1 , R e ) triple satisfying R e = I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z|U) + I(A; V |U) is achievable.\n\u2022 (Subcase 3) For case (iii), case (iv), case (v) and case (vi), all of the conﬁdential message S is transmitted by the secret key.\nFor subcase 1 and subcase 3 (using feedback), a block Markov coding scheme is used. For subcase 2, a coding scheme similar to that in [4] is used. Now the remaining of this section is organized as follows. For the three subcases, the construction of the code is introduced in Subsection IV-A, and the equivocation analysis is given in Subsection IV-B.\n\u2022 (Step i) The ﬁrst part of Step (i) is about the determination of the size of the conﬁdential message set S and the common message set T , the second part is a realization of the auxiliary random vector U N , see the following.\n\u2013 (Determination of the size of S and T for subcase 1)\nThe conﬁdential message set S and the common message set T satisfy the following conditions:\nwhere γ 2 is a ﬁxed number and γ 2 ≥ 0. Moreover, let S = (S 1 , S 2 ) (S 1 is independent of S 2 , and they are uniformly distributed over their ranges), and the ranges of S 1 and S 2 satisfy:\nNote that by using R 1 = I(K; Y |U) − γ 2 , R e ≤ R 1 and R e = I(K; Y |U) − I(A; Z|U) + I(A; V |U), it\nγ 2 ≤ I(A; Z) − I(A; V ) − I(U; Z) + I(U; V ) ≤ I(A; Y ) − I(A; V ) − I(U; Z)\n\u2013 (Determination of the size of S and T for subcase 2 and subcase 3) The conﬁdential message set S and the common message set T satisfy the following conditions:\n(Construction of U N ) For all the three subcases, gener- ate 2 N R 0 +N I(U ;V ) codewords u N (t, i), and each of them is uniformly drawn from the typical set T N U (ϵ ∗∗∗ ). Note that t ∈ T and i ∈ I = {1, ..., 2 N I(U ;V ) }.\nFor a given common message t (t ∈ T ) and side information v N , try to ﬁnd a codeword in subset\n{u N (t, 1), ..., u N (t, 2 N I(U ;V ) ) } that is jointly typi- cal with v N , say u N (t, i ∗ ), i.e., (u N (t, i ∗ ), v N ) ∈ T N U V (ϵ ∗∗∗ ). If multiple such sequences in subset {u N (t, 1), ..., u N (t, 2 N I(U ;V ) ) } exist, choose the one with the smallest i ∗ . If no such i ∗ exists, then declare an encoding error.\nIn subcase 3, for each u N (t, i), generate a vector a N i.i.d. according to p A |U , and a N is a realization of A N .\nThe construction of A N in subcase 1 and 2 is similar to the construction of X N in [4]. The random variables J , L and M are used for indexing the random vector A N , and they take values in J , L and M, respectively. The details about the construction of A N is in [7], and we omit it here.\n\u2013 (Subcase 1) Generate a set R K composed of 2 N I(K;Y ) −Nγ 5 sequences k N , and each of them is uniformly drawn from the typical set T N K (ϵ ∗ ). Divide the set R K into ∥ S 2 ∥ subsets, and each subset R K,i (1 ≤ i ≤∥ S 2 ∥) corresponds to a speciﬁc value in S 2 . Here note that from (4.4), we have\nMeanwhile, generate a mapping g f : Y N → S 2 (note that 2 N H(Y ) ≥∥ S 2 ∥). Deﬁne a random variable K ∗ = g f (Y N ), which is uniformly distributed over S 2 , and K ∗ is independent of S 2 . Reveal the map- ping g f to both receivers and the transmitter.\nWe use the block Markov coding method for subcase 1. The random vectors U N , K N , A N and X N consist of n blocks of length N . The common message for n blocks is T n \t (T 1 , ..., T n ), which is composed of n i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed over T . The conﬁdential message for n blocks is S n ((S 1,1 , (S 1,2 , S 2,2 ), ..., (S 1,n , S 2,n )), where S 1,i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed over S 1 , and S 2,i (2 ≤ i ≤ n) are i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed over S 2 . Note that in the ﬁrst block, there is no S 2,1 .\nIn the ﬁrst block, randomly choose a sequence k N from the the set R K to transmit, and k N is a realization of K N in the ﬁrst block.\nIn the i-th block (2 ≤ i ≤ n), when the transmitter receives the output y N of the i-1-th block, he com- putes k ∗ i = g f (y N ) ∈ S 2 . For the given s 2,i , the transmitter randomly chooses a sequence k N from the subset R K,i=s 2,i ⊕k ∗\n(where ⊕ is the modulo addition over S 2 ), and k N is a realization of K N in the i-th block (2 ≤ i ≤ n).\n\u2013 (Subcase 2) Since there is no need to use feedback in subcase 2, randomly choose a sequence k N from the typical set T N K (ϵ ∗ ) to transmit, and k N is a realization of K N\n\u2013 (Subcase 3) Letting S 2 = S and removing S 1 , the description of K N in subcase 3 is along the lines of that in subcase 1, and therefore, we omit the description here.\n\u2022 (Step iii) (A realization of X N ) For all the three subcases, the x N is generated according to a new discrete memoryless channel (DMC) with inputs k N , a N jlm , v N , and output x N . The transition probabil- ity of this new DMC is p X |A,K,V (x |a, k, v), which is obtained from the joint probability mass function\n\u2013 (Subcase 1) For given y N , try to ﬁnd a sequence a N ˆ jˆ l ˆ m such that (a N ˆ jˆ l ˆ m , y N ) ∈ T N AY (ϵ ∗∗ ).
