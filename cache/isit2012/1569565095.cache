The concept behind the proposed technique builds on the fact that both the desired and interfering signals originate from the base station (BS) of the downlink system itself. Based on this observation, the pro- posed method inﬂuences the resulting interference, to reduce the transmission power required to cancel it, without altering the information content of the downlink message. The aim is to bring the interference closer to the replicas of the desired symbols for all users in the THP modulo-extended constellation. In this way, the power required to pre-subtract interference is decreased. Theoretical and simulation results both conﬁrm that, by optimizing the interference to be canceled, the proposed technique offers a considerable transmit power reduction compared to conventional THP while securing an equal error rate performance.\nIndex Terms\u2014Tomlinson-Harashima precoding, power loss, known interference, multi-user MIMO, non-linear precoding"},"body":{"text":"The need to produce power- and cost-efﬁcient mobile devices has recently stimulated interest towards precoding schemes for the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) downlink transmis- sion. Simple forms of precoding schemes already appear in com- munication standards such as the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) [1] and are expected to dominate future implementations of telecommunications networks. Capacity achieving non-linear dirty paper coding (DPC) techniques [2] have been proposed for pre-subtracting interference prior to transmission. The DPC methods developed so far are in general complex as they require sophisticated sphere-search algorithms [3] to be employed at the transmitter and assume codewords with inﬁnite length for the encoding of the data. On the other hand, linear precoding schemes [4]-[6] offer the least complexity, but their performance is far from achieving the optimum maximum likelihood bound. Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP) is presented for the MIMO downlink in [7] as a low complexity, sub-optimum alternative to DPC. This scheme, inspired by the work in [8] proposed for the inter-symbol interference channel, applies a modulo pre-subtraction of the known interference. However, the THP scheme suffers three forms of performance losses: power loss, modulo loss and shaping loss.\nThe use of the modulo operation at the transmitter and receiver results in an increased transmit power compared to the case when no precoding is used. This is quantiﬁed by the power loss and happens because the transmitted symbols are distributed in the Voronoi region [7] of the nominal constellation points which consists of an extension of the symbol constella- tion area. To alleviate this problem, in [9] it is proposed to adaptively tilt the constellation used, in such a way that the\ntransmit power is minimized on an instantaneous basis. This causes a reduction in the transmission efﬁciency due to the need to allocate channel resources for the transmission of side information, to inform the receiver which angle was used at the transmitter. This paper proposes a dynamic THP scheme which adaptively inﬂuences the interference to reduce its quantized distance to the desired symbol and the resulting power loss. In particular, the interference experienced between the MIMO sub-streams is generated by the symbols transmitted by the BS itself, which means that the transmitter can inﬂuence and alter the interference between the transmitted symbols. Furthermore, as a result of the QR factorization used in THP one of the users experiences no interference, while causing interference to all remaining users.\nBased on this observation, the proposed scheme takes a further step in precoding along the interference. The amplitude and phase of the transmitted symbol of the interference-free user is optimized so that the resulting interference experienced by the rest of the users is moved closer to one of the replicas of the desired constellation points, in the modulo-extended symbol constellation. This is done under the constraint that a threshold performance for this user is guaranteed. By doing so, the precoding power loss is reduced, without affecting the average error rate performance. Initial results involving amplitude-only optimization of the transmitted symbol of the interference-free user were shown in [10]. It should be made clear that the proposed scheme does not consist of a power allocation THP scheme. The amplitude and phase of the ﬁrst user here are optimized to align interference to the desired symbols, as opposed to power allocation THP schemes (e.g. [11]) where power is allocated to the users according to their channel conditions and required transmission rates. In fact, power allocation can be used as an add-on to the proposed scheme by adjusting the bases of the modulo operations. For simplicity and to restrict the focus of the paper, power allocation is not considered here and we consider the zero forcing THP design.\nWe consider a downlink system comprised of a single BS equipped with N transmit antennas and M ≤ N users with a single receive antenna each. The received signals of all antennas can be represented by the vector\n(m, n)-th element h m,n being the complex-Gaussian channel tap between the n-th transmit and the m-th receive antenna. Also, x ∈ C N ×1 is the vector with the symbols transmitted by the N transmit antennas and w ∈ C M ×1 ∼ CN (0, σ 2 I M ) is the vector of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) components at the M receive antennas. For the purposes of the analysis below, full knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is assumed at the BS transmitter, which is a common assumption for precoding schemes.\nFor THP the channel matrix is ﬁrst lower-triangularized to attain the following lower triangular matrix with ones on its diagonal\nwhere F is a unitary precoding matrix obtained by the QL factorization (an equivalent of QR factorization) of the channel matrix H H = F · L where L H = H · F is lower triangular and G = diag( {L} −1 i,i ) represents the scaling operation of the signal at the receiver. In this way the MIMO channel is transformed into the formulation\n   \n   \n   \n1 \t 0 · · · 0 b 2,1 1 · · · 0\n.. . \t .. . · · · .. . b M, 1 b M, 2 · · · 1\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n(3) To achieve interference-free performance the transmitted sym- bols are calculated as\nin an iterative manner, where b k,l is the k, l-th element of matrix B and [.]mod L denotes the modulo operation with base L. u k is the k-th user\u2019s information data symbol, selected from an integer constellation A = {a R +ia I |a R , a I ∈ {±1, ±3, ...±(\nwhere Q is the constellation order. L is chosen as the minimum distance between the constellation points, to form a Voronoi region around each point and is given as L =\na result, the transmitted symbols are constrained within the interval −\nThe fact that this interval exceeds the original constellation region leads to the power loss. After the above interference pre- subtraction and to attain the formulation in (3) the transmitter sends\nThe k-th receiver simply scales its received signal by the k-th diagonal element of matrix G ( g k,k ) and applies the modulo operation, which can be written as\nRe Im\nx 2 =[u 2 -b 21 ·x 1 ]mod L ~\nFig. 1 graphically illustrates the concept of CIO-THP pro- cessing by comparison to THP, for the example of 4QAM, for a two-user downlink (considered for simplicity). The dashed lines correspond to THP and the solid lines to the proposed CIO-THP. For THP, it is assumed that x 1 = u 1 (denoted by the dashed green arrow) is the non-optimized interference-free symbol, while x 2 experiences interference I 2 = b 2,1 x 1 (dashed red arrow) from symbol x 1 . The aim of the transmit processing is to code along I 2 and transmit its quantized distance to the desired symbol u 2 . The transmit modulo operation then selects the symbol replica that matches the instantaneous data symbol and is closest to the direction of interference, and transmits its distance to I 2 (dashed black arrow). In the abovementioned THP processing and in (3) it can be seen that user 1, being an interference-free user, does not need to apply any interference subtraction. Therefore, the modulo operation to limit the trans- mitted power can be avoided for user 1. This allows a margin for inﬂuencing the symbol x 1 without sacriﬁcing the reliability of its detection.\nTo illustrate the concept behind the proposed algorithm, the solid lines in ﬁg. 1 show the operation of CIO-THP. Now the amplitude and phase of x 1 are changed in ˜ x 1 (solid green arrow). ˜ x 1 is altered in such a way that the resulting interference ˜ I 2 = b 2,1 ˜ x 1 (solid red arrow) to u 2 is brought closer to a replica ˆ u 2 of the constellation point of u 2 . It can be seen that in this case the system beneﬁts in two ways: a) since the amplitude of ˜ x 1 is increased, user 1 experiences better performance and b) the resulting interference (which is also amplitude-phase optimized) is closer to the replica ˆ u 2 of the information symbol u 2 and hence lower transmitted power needs to be spent for the cancellation of the interference in ˜ x 2 (solid black arrow). Note that the total transmit power P tot = |x 1 | 2 + |x 2 | 2 is the same for both techniques in ﬁg. 1. It can therefore be observed that for CIO-THP, from the total amount of power transmitted a larger percentage is invested in the information of the symbol\nx 1 than in the cancellation of interference in x 2 , compared to THP. To guarantee a performance threshold for the interference- free user after the optimization of its interference to the second user, ˜ x 1 can fall within the region of the constellation where the distances to the decision thresholds (real-imaginary axes) are above a speciﬁed threshold. This is denoted by the green area around x 1 in ﬁg. 1. Using this constraint, the modiﬁcation of the phase and amplitude of x 1 (factor α below) need not be signaled to the receiver.\nTo exploit the above observations, it is proposed that the real and imaginary parts of the symbol of the interference-free user are scaled by the factors α r , α i respectively such that the output power distribution is optimized. The transmitted symbol of user k is then given as\nThe notation ˜ x i (α) is used to show that the transmitted symbols are now a function of α = α r +iα i . In this way, the optimization problem can be formulated as\ns.t.c. Φ(α r , α i ) \t (9) where Φ(α r , α i ) is a set of modulation-dependent constraints on α r , α i that guarantee a minimum performance for the interference-free user. These are listed in Table I below, for the most practical modulation schemes relevant to existing communication standards. In this table g 1,1 is the ﬁrst diagonal element of the diagonal matrix G and γ is a signal-to-noise (SNR) threshold.\nNote that, since α is such that the received symbol falls in the green shaded area of ﬁg. 1 and the received SNR is strictly increased, there is no need to equalize α at the receiver. Hence α need not be fedforward to the receiver and the receive processing follows the one for standard THP as shown in eq. (6).\nGiven the replica ˆ u k of the information symbol for each of the users for which u k − k−1 l =1 b k,l ˜ x l (α) mod L = ˆ u k −\nb k,l ˜ x l (α), the optimization in (8)-(9) can be transformed into a convex optimization problem which can easily be solved with numerical techniques. To prove this let us expand P tot in (8) to get\nBy further expanding the term in the summation over all subtraction iterations it can be seen that each of the transmitted symbols can be expressed in the form\nwhere the summations are generated up to y ≤ k − 2. For the power associated with each element in (11) we then have\nwhere z r , z i , ¯ z denote the real part, imaginary part and complex conjugate of z. Using these expressions the optimization in (8)- (9) can be written in the form\ns.t. Φ(α r , α i ) \t (15) where for a given channel and ˆ u k , the coefﬁcients c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , c 4 are constant, given by\nIt is clear that the optimization in (15) is a quadratic program- ming optimization of the form\ns.t. Aa ≤ b \t (17) with A,b according to Table I. For the example of 4QAM used in the following simulations\n− γg 2 1,1 σ 2 /2 − γg 2 1,1 σ 2 /2\nFor all cases of constraints in Table I and since c 1 > 0, c 2 > 0 from (16) and Q is always positive deﬁnite, it can be seen that the optimization is strictly convex and has a unique global optimum. Using the Lagrangian function L(a, λ) = 1 2 a T Qa + c T a + λ(Aa − b), the optimization can be solved by a number of techniques [12].\nWhile analytical calculations of the power loss for THP and CIO-THP can be found in [13], here we calculate the probability of error for both techniques assuming N = M and 4QAM modulation which is used in the following simulations. The extension to higher order modulation such as 16-QAM is straightforward using the following and the derivations of [14] on the resulting modulo loss. From (6) it can be seen that, the THP channel of user k can be paralleled to the single input single output (SISO) channel\nIn (20) {L} k,k = l k,k is the k-th diagonal element of the matrix L. We shall calculate the probability of error for THP and CIO- THP based on the SNR of this expression and separately taking into account the modulo loss imposed by the modulo operation at the receiver.\nUsing the results in [15] it can easily be seen that for the QR decomposition of the scaled channel matrix H assumed here with elements of zero mean and variance σ 2 h = 1 M N we have i.i.d elements with l k,n ∼ CN (0, σ 2 l k,n = 1 M N ) for n < k and l 2 k,k ∼ X 2 d with d = 2(M −k+1) M N , where l k,n is the (k, n)-th element of the lower triangular matrix L. Using the above, the average received SNR for THP can be written as\nwhere E b and N 0 are the per bit and noise power respectively. The probability of symbol error for a ﬂat fading channel for 4QAM modulation based on the received SNR is calculated as\nwhere Q(x) = 1 √ 2π ∞ x e − t2 2 dt. It was shown in [14] that the effect of the modulo operation at the receiver (modulo loss) is to double the probability of error for 4QAM modulation for THP. Therefore the average probability of error for THP is ˜ P =\nFor CIO-THP the only difference in performance comes form the fact that the signal of user 1 is scaled by α opt . Therefore we have\nBy substituting ˜ γ 1 in (22) we can calculate ˜ P for CIO-THP from (IV-A). In the following section the above expressions are compared to numerical results, revealing a close match between theory and simulation.\nThis section presents numerical results based on Monte Carlo simulations of the proposed CIO-THP and conventional THP for the frequency ﬂat Rayleigh fading statistically uncorrelated MIMO channel whose impulse response is assumed perfectly known at the transmitter. A system employing 4QAM modula- tion is explored for the case with N = M while it is clear that the beneﬁts of the proposed technique extend to systems with more antennas and higher order modulation.\nIn ﬁg. 2 the power loss for THP and CIO-THP with γ = E b /N 0 , i.e. when the SNR threshold for the interference-free user is equal to the average transmit SNR, is compared for increasing numbers of antennas N =M . It can be observed that there is actually a power gain for systems with up to N =4 antennas. Clearly, however, the power loss reduction for CIO- THP continues for higher numbers of antennas.\nFig. 3 shows the power loss averaged over the users with increasing average transmit SNR= E b /N 0 (in dB) for a 4 × 4 MIMO system for conventional THP compared to for CIO-THP for γ=15 / 20 / 25 dB and when γ = E b /N 0 . It can be seen that a degree of reduction of the power loss appears for low transmit SNR values which signiﬁcantly ampliﬁes for higher transmit SNR values where greater margins are available for\nthe optimization of the interference caused by user 1. For the case when γ = E b /N 0 a constant gain in transmit power is observed which amounts to 21.95% of the power transmitted with THP.\nNext we quantify the beneﬁts of CIO-THP in the error rate performance when the saved transmission power is reinvested to attain a greater received SNR. In ﬁg. 4 the symbol error rate (SER) is shown for increasing SNR for a 2 × 2 MIMO for both THP and CIO-THP with γ = E b /N 0 and γ = 20dB. For this comparison the power saved by CIO-THP is used to scale up the transmitted symbols and hence both techniques have equal transmitted power. The analytically calculated average perfor- mance of section IV for both techniques is also included and it is evident that it closely matches the simulated performance. It can be seen that an SNR gain of up to 5dB for CIO-THP can be achieved in this small scale 2 × 2 MIMO system.\nWith conventional MIMO-THP critical signal energy is wasted in canceling interference that does not align with the useful signal. This paper has proposed a further step towards\ncoding along interference, where the transmitter controls the resulting interference to make its cancellation more efﬁcient. It was shown that by judiciously adjusting the amplitude and phase of the interference-free user, the proposed scheme needs to invest less transmission power in order to cancel interference and the power loss for THP is signiﬁcantly reduced.\nThis work was supported by the Royal Academy of Engineer- ing, UK and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research of the European Commission under FET-Open grant number CROWN-233843."},"refs":[{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical Channels and Mod- ulation"}},{"authors":[{"name":"U.
