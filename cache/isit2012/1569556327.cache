Due to the inability of rechargeable energy sources to charge and discharge at the same time, a constraint we term the energy half-duplex constraint, two rechargeable energy storage devices (ESDs) are assumed so that at any given time, there is always one ESD being recharged. The energy harvesting rate is a random variable that is constant over the time interval of interest. A save- then-transmit (ST) protocol is introduced, in which a fraction of time ρ (dubbed the save ratio) is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting, with the remaining fraction 1 − ρ used for data transmission. The ratio of the energy obtainable from an ESD to the energy harvested is termed the ESD efﬁciency, η. We address the practical case of the secondary ESD being a battery with η < 1, and the main ESD being a super-capacitor with η = 1. The optimal save-ratio that minimizes outage probability is derived, from which some useful design guidelines are drawn. Numerical results are provided to validate our proposed study."},"body":{"text":"The operation of communication networks powered either largely or exclusively by renewable sources has become increasingly attractive, both due to the increased desire to reduce energy consumption in human activities at large, and due to necessity brought about by the concept of networking heterogeneous devices ranging from medical sensors on/in the human body to environment sensors in the wilderness [1], [2]. Sensor nodes are powered by batteries that often cannot be replaced because of the inaccessibility of the devices. Therefore, once the battery of a sensor node is exhausted, the node dies. Thus the potentially maintenance-free and virtually perpetual operation offered by energy harvesting, whereby energy is extracted from the environment, is appealing.\nThe availability of an inexhaustible but unreliable energy source changes a system designer\u2019s options considerably, com- pared to the conventional cases of an inexhaustible reliable en- ergy source (powered by the grid), and an exhaustible reliable energy source (powered by batteries). There has been recent research on understanding data packet scheduling with an energy harvesting transmitter that has a rechargeable battery, most of which employed a deterministic energy harvesting model. In [3], the transmission time for a given amount of data is minimized through power control based on known energy arrivals over all time. Structural properties of the optimum solution were then used to establish a fast search algorithm. This work has been extended to battery limited cases in [4], and battery imperfections in [5]. Energy harvesting with channel fading has been investigated in [6] and [7], wherein\na water-ﬁlling energy allocation solution where the so-called water levels follow a staircase function was proved to be optimal.\nAn information theoretic analysis of energy harvesting communication systems has been provided in [8], [9]. In [8], the authors proved that the capacity of the AWGN channel with stochastic energy arrivals is equal to the capacity with an average power constraint equal to the average recharge rate. This work has been extended in [9] to the fading Gaussian channels with perfect/no channel state information at the transmitter.\nDue to the theoretical intractability of online power schedul- ing under the energy causality constraint (cumulative energy consumed is not allowed to exceed the cumulative energy harvested at every point in time), most current research is focused on an ofﬂine strategy with deterministic channel and energy state information, which is not practical and can only provide an upper bound on system performance.\nIn this paper, we consider a wireless system with one transmitter and one receiver, with the transmitter using a save-then-transmit (ST) protocol (see Fig. 1) to deliver Q bits within T seconds, the duration of a transmission frame. Because rechargeable energy storage devices (ESDs) cannot both charge and discharge simultaneously , which is termed the energy half-duplex constraint in this paper, an energy harvesting transmitter needs two ESDs, which we call the main ESD (MESD) and secondary ESD (SESD). The transmitter draws power from the MESD for data transmission, over which time the SESD is connected to the energy source and charges up. At the end of transmission for a frame, the SESD transfers its stored energy to the MESD. A fraction ρ (called the save-ratio) of every frame interval is used exclusively for energy harvesting by the MESD 1 . The energy storage efﬁciency, denoted by η, of each ESD may not be 100 percent, and a ﬁxed amount of power P c is assumed to be consumed by the transmitter hardware whenever it is powered up. The frame interval T is assumed to be small relative to the time constant of changes in the ESD charging rate (or energy arrival rate). The energy arrival rate is therefore modeled as a random variable X in Joules/second which is assumed to be constant over a frame.\noutage probability (to be deﬁned in the next section) over ρ, when transmitting over a block fading channel with an arbitrary fading distribution. In this work, we particularize to the case where the MESD is a high-efﬁciency super-capacitor with η = 1, and the SESD is a low-efﬁciency rechargeable battery with 0 < η < 1. Other conﬁgurations of the MESD and SESD will be considered in future work.\nThe block diagram of the system is given in Fig. 2. The energy recovered from the environment 2 replenishes either the MESD or the SESD at any given time, as indicated by switch a. The MESD powers the transmitter directly and usually has high power density, good recycle ability and high efﬁciency, e.g. a super-capacitor [10]. Since the MESD cannot charge and discharge simultaneously, a SESD (e.g. rechargeable battery) stores up harvested energy while the transmitter is on, and transfers all its stored energy to the MESD once the transmitter is off. We assume in the rest of this paper that the SESD is a battery with an efﬁciency η, where η ∈ [0, 1]. This means that a fraction η of the energy transferred into the SESD during charging can be subsequently recovered during dis- charging. Other conﬁgurations of battery/supercapacitor and MESD/SESD will be considered in our future work.\nWe assume that Q bits of data are generated and must be transmitted within a time slot of duration T seconds (i.e., delay constrained). In the proposed ST protocol, the save-ratio ρ is the reserved fraction of time for energy harvesting by the MESD within one transmission slot. In other words, data delivery only takes place in the last (1 − ρ)T seconds of each time slot, which results in an effective rate of R eﬀ = Q (1 −ρ)T\nbits/sec. We also allow for a constant power consumption of P c Watts by the transmitter hardware whenever it is powered on. The combined inﬂuence of ρ, η and P c on outage probability is quantiﬁed in this work.\nAssume a block-fading frequency-nonselective channel, where the channel is constant over the time slot T . Over any time slot, the baseband-equivalent channel output is given by\nwhere x is the transmitted signal, y is the received signal, and n is i.i.d. circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) noise with zero mean and variance σ 2 n .\nFor any frame, the ST protocol (cf. Fig. 1) is described as follows:\n\u2022 During time interval (0, ρT ], harvested energy accumu- lates in the MESD, which corresponds to the situation that switches b, c are open and a connects to the MESD in Fig. 2;\n\u2022 From time ρT to T , the transmitter is powered on for transmission with energy from the MESD. We assume all the buffered energy in the MESD is used up for transmission in each frame. Since the MESD cannot charge and discharge at the same time, the SESD starts to store up harvested energy while the transmitter is on. Referring to Fig. 2, c is closed, b is open and a switches to the SESD;\n\u2022 At time T , the transmitter completes the transmission and powers off. The SESD transfers all its buffered energy to the MESD within a negligible charging time, at efﬁciency η. In other words, b is closed and switch a, c are open in Fig. 2.\nThe rate at which the ESDs are charged by the renewable en- ergy source is modeled as a random variable X Joules/second (J/s). This is justiﬁed by the assumption that the transmission frame interval T is much smaller than the time constant of changes in energy availability, e.g., changes in solar or wind energy availability occur on a time scale of seconds, whereas T is typically on the order of fractions of a second. Therefore the random process X(t) representing ESD recharge rate at time t is reasonably assumed to be constant over each window of T seconds.\nIt is clear that X is a non-negative random variable with ﬁnite support, i.e. 0 ≤ X ≤ P H < ∞, as the maximum amount of power one can extract from any source is ﬁnite. Suppose f X (x) and F X (x) represent its probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF), respectively. According to the proposed ST protocol, the total buffered energy in the MESD at t = ρT (the start of data transmission within a transmission slot) is given by\nas the average trans- mission power, which is constant over the entire transmission period, and P c as the circuit power (i.e. the power consumed\nby the hardware during data transmission), again assumed con- stant. The mutual information of the channel (1) conditioned on X and the channel gain h is (assuming P > P c )\n(3) where Γ = |h| 2 σ 2\nFor a transmitter with energy harvesting capability and working under the ST protocol, the outage event is the union of two mutually exclusive events: Circuit Outage and Channel Outage. Circuit Outage occurs when the MESD has insufﬁcient energy stored up at t = ρT to even power on the hardware for the duration of transmission i.e. E T < P c (1 −ρ)T or equivalent P < P c . Channel outage is deﬁned as the MESD having sufﬁcient stored energy but the channel realization does not support the required target rate R eﬀ = Q (1 −ρ)T bits/s.\nRecalling that X ∈ [0, P H ], the probabilities of Circuit Outage and Channel Outage are therefore:\n1 \t otherwise. \t (4) P channel out \t = Pr {log 2 (1 + (P − P c )Γ) < R eﬀ , P > P c }\n. Since Circuit Outage and Channel Outage are mutually exclu- sive, it follows that\nf X (x)F Γ [g( ·)] dx if P H > ϕ( ·) 1 \t otherwise.\nUnlike the conventional deﬁnition of outage probability in a block fading channel, which is dependent only on the fading distribution and a ﬁxed average transmit power constraint, in an energy harvesting system with block fading and the ST protocol, both transmit power and channel are random, and the resulting outage is thus a function of the save-ratio ρ, the battery efﬁciency η and the circuit power P c .\nIn this section, we design the save-ratio ρ for the ST protocol by solving the optimization problem\ni.e. optimize average outage performance P out in (6) over ρ, for any given η ∈ [0, 1] and P c ∈ [0, ∞). Due to the complex form of P out in (6), numerical methods must be used to solve (P1). In general, the problem is not convex.\nDenote the optimal (minimum) outage probability as P ∗ out (η, P c ) and the optimal save-ratio as ρ ∗ (η, P c ). Note that ρ ↗ 1 represents transmission of a very short burst at the end of each frame, and the rest of each frame is reserved for MESD energy harvesting. ρ = 0 is another special case, in which the energy consumed in frame i was collected (by the SESD) entirely in frame i − 1. (P1) can always be solved through numerical search, but it is challenging to give a closed form solution for ρ ∗ (η, P c ) in terms of P c and η in general. We will instead analyze how ρ ∗ (η, P c ) varies with P c and η and thereby get some insights in the rest of this section.\nProposition 3.1: P out (ρ, η, P c ) in (6) is a non-increasing function of battery efﬁciency η and a non-decreasing function of circuit power P c for ρ ∈ [0, 1). The optimal value of (P1) P ∗ out (η, P c ) is strictly decreasing with η and strictly increasing with P c .\nThe proof of proposition 3.1 is omitted because of space limitations, but its intuition is clear: If η grows, the energy available to the transmitter can only grow or remain the same, whatever the values of ρ and P c , hence P out must be non-increasing with η; if P c grows, the energy available for transmission decreases, leading to higher P out .\nSuppose that circuit power is negligible, i.e. all the energy is spent on transmission, and the SESD has perfect energy- transfer efﬁciency. The condition P H > P c /( ρ 1 −ρ + η) is always satisﬁed, and problem (P1) is simpliﬁed to\nwhere the optimal value of (P2) is denoted as P ∗ out (1, 0), and the optimal save-ratio is denoted as ρ ∗ (1, 0).\nLemma 3.1: The minimum outage probability when η = 1 and P c = 0 is given by\nProof: Please refer to the journal version of this paper [11].\nLemma 3.1 indicates that the optimal strategy for a transmit- ter that uses no power to operate its circuitry powered by two ESDs with 100 percent efﬁciency, is to transmit continuously 3 .\nThis is not surprising because the SESD collects energy from the environment just as efﬁciently as the MESD does, and so idling the transmitter while the MESD harvests energy wastes transmission resources (time) while not reaping any gains (energy harvested). However, we will see that this is only true when there is no circuit power and perfect storage efﬁciency.\nWhen the SESD energy transfer efﬁciency η < 1 and P c = 0, (P1) becomes\nwhere the optimal value of (P3) is denoted as P ∗ out (η, 0), and the optimal save-ratio is denoted as ρ ∗ (η, 0).\nLemma 3.2: When SESD energy transfer efﬁciency η < 1 and circuit power P c = 0, the optimal save-ratio ρ has the following properties.\n1) It is non-zero only for small η:       \n2) ρ ∗ (η, 0) is a non-increasing function of η, for 0 ≤ η ≤ 1. Proof: Please refer to [11].\nAccording to (9), if the SESD efﬁciency is above a thresh- old, the increased energy available to the transmitter if the MESD rather than the SESD collects energy over [0, ρT ] is not sufﬁcient to overcome the extra energy required to transmit at the higher rate R eﬀ over (ρT, T ]. The result is that the optimal ρ is 0. On the other hand, if η is below that threshold, then some amount of time should be spent harvesting energy using the higher-efﬁciency MESD even at the expense of losing transmission time. Lemma 3.2 quantiﬁes precisely the interplay among η, Q, T and ρ.\nWe should note here that even though we consider the case of having two ESD\u2019s, by setting η = 0, we effectively remove the SESD and hence our analysis applies also to the single-ESD case. According to (9), if we only have one ESD, the optimal save ratio is ρ ∗ (0, 0), which is always larger than 0. This is intuitively sensible, because with only one ESD obeying the energy half-duplex constraint, it would be impossible to transmit all the time (ρ = 0) because that would leave no time at all for energy harvesting.\nNon-zero circuit power P c leads to two mutually exclusive effects: (i) zero probability of powering on the transmitter for the (1 −ρ)T duration of transmission \u2013 this is when P H < ϕ( ·) in (6); and (ii) higher outage probability if P H > ϕ( ·) because some power is devoted to running the hardware.\ndecreases as ρ increases, its maximum value is P c η . Therefore, if P H > P c η , the transmitter would be able to\nrecover enough energy (with non-zero probability) to power on the transmitter, i.e. ρ ∈ [0, 1). If P H ≤ P c η , by condition P H ≤\n. In summary,\nP out = ˆ P out (ρ, η, P c ), ∀ρ ∈ [0, 1) \u2022 If P c ≥ P H η\n    \nIf P c ≥ ηP H , referring to (10), we may conclude that ρ ∗ (η, P c ) >\ndue to the needs of offsetting circuit power consumption. If P c < ηP H , theoretically, the transmit- ter is able to recover enough energy (with non-zero probability for all ρ ∈ [0, 1)) to transmit.\nLemma 3.3: For an energy harvesting transmitter with bat- tery efﬁciency η and ﬁnite circuit power P c ,\nIntuitively, the smaller the circuit power is, the more en- ergy we can spend on transmission; the larger the battery efﬁciency is, the more energy we can recover from energy harvesting. Small circuit power and high battery efﬁciency suggests continuous transmission (ρ ∗ (η, P c ) = 0), which is consistent with our intuition. According to Lemma 3.3, larger circuit power may be compensated by larger ESD efﬁciency (when the threshold for η is smaller than 1). A non-zero save ratio is only desired if there exists signiﬁcant circuit power to be offset or substantial ESD inefﬁciency to be compensated. The threshold depends on required transmission rate.\nTo obtain numerical results, we assume that the energy harvesting rate X follows a uniform distribution within [0, 100]\n(i.e., P H = 100 J/s), and the channel is Rayleigh fading with exponentially distributed Γ with parameter λ = 0.02. We also assume the target transmission rate R req = Q T = 2 bits/s. 4 .\nFig. 3 demonstrates how battery efﬁciency η and circuit power P c would affect the optimal save-ratio ρ ∗ . As observed, larger P c and smaller η would result in larger ρ ∗ , i.e. shorter transmission time. Since the increment is more substantial along P c axis, circuit power P c has a larger inﬂuence on the optimal save-ratio compared with battery efﬁciency η. ρ ∗ (1, 0) = 0 veriﬁes the result of Lemma 3.1 for an ideal system, while ρ ∗ (η, 0) along the line P c = 0 demonstrates the \u201cphase transition\u201d behavior stated in Lemma 3.2. Fig. 4 gives P ∗ out (η, P c ). Consistent with Proposition 3.1, P ∗ out (η, P c ) is monotonically decreasing with battery efﬁciency η and monotonically increasing with circuit power P c . Again, P c affects outage performance more signiﬁcantly then η. From Fig. 4, we see that for a reasonable outage probability e.g. below 0.05, P c has to be small and η has to be close to 1. Our results can be used to ﬁnd the feasible region in the η-P c plane for a given allowable P out . Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 compare the outage performance before and after optimization. We can see that optimizing over save-ratio signiﬁcantly improves system performance.\nIn this paper, we studied a wireless system under practical energy harvesting conditions. Assuming a general model with non-ideal energy storage efﬁciency and transmit circuit power, we proposed a Save-then-Transmit (ST) protocol to optimize the system outage performance via ﬁnding the optimal save- ratio. We characterized how the optimal save-ratio and the minimum outage probability vary with practical system pa- rameters. Both analytical and numerical results provide useful guidelines for practical system design."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A. Sinha"},{"name":"A.
