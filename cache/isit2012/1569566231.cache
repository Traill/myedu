The source nodes may choose their nearest neighbor from the set of inactive nodes as their relay. Although cooperation can poten- tially lead to signiﬁcant improvements on the asymptotic error probability of a communication pair, relaying causes additional interference in the network, increasing the average noise. We address the basic question: how should source nodes optimally balance cooperation vs. interference to guarantee reliability in all communication pairs. Based on the decode-and-forward (DF) scheme at the relays, we derive closed-form approximations to the upper bounds on the error probability, averaging over all node positions. Surprisingly, in the small outage probability regime, there is an almost binary behavior that dictates \u2013depending on network parameters\u2013 the activation or not of all relay nodes."},"body":{"text":"In order to cope with the increasing trafﬁc demands future wireless networks must employ strategies which provide an optimal use of resources such as bandwidth and power. Over the past decade, there has been great interest in cooperative networks [1] where relay nodes can be exploited as a means to increase throughput and reliability. Although the capacity of the single-relay channel [2] remains unsolved and its optimal coding scheme unknown, signiﬁcant progress has been made in quantifying the performance gains obtained from cooperation. The information-theoretic research in this topic was mainly focused on simple networks with few nodes or ﬁxed topologies where perfect channel state information (CSI) can be available to all terminal nodes. Finding explicit capacity regions of large networks may be \u2013if feasible\u2013 very hard. To tackle this limitation, spatial models employing tools from stochastic geometry and graphs, provide a comprehensive framework for the analysis of large wireless networks with little interference management [3], [4]. In this setup, the inter- ference between users is treated as noise [5] whose statistical properties depend on the particular spatial distribution of the nodes and fading realizations of the wireless paths.\nIn this paper, we study upper bounds \u2013in terms of the outage probability (OP)\u2013 on the asymptotic error probability of large wireless networks in which the sources are aided\nby nearby relays. A ﬁrst step in this direction was taken in [6] where the performance gain of adding a \u2013full-duplex\u2013 single-relay to only one node of the network was studied. This setup was somewhat limited because the expressions derived did not measure network-wide performance, specially did not quantify the interference added in the network resulting from the relays. We now consider a network formed of clusters with source-relay-destination nodes which use the decode- and-forward (DF) scheme [2] in a full-duplex fashion and clusters with source-destination pairs which employ direct transmission (DT). Assume that CSI is not available at the source nodes, which may arise in wireless environments. Each source decides to activate or not a relay node randomly with the same probability, and independent of all network parame- ters. Regarding the relay position two different scenarios are considered:\n\u2022 The relays are located at a ﬁxed relative distance with respect to their sources,\n\u2022 Every source chooses its nearest neighbor (NN) as its re- lay (a reasonable assumption when using the DF scheme).\nIn this last case the relay is randomly located which means that in all the clusters the relays are in different positions and that we need to average over all possible relay positions to derive the OP. The network is modeled as an independently marked Poisson point process, limited by the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) where signal attenuation occurs both through path loss and Rayleigh fading. An outage event is declared whenever the distribution of nodes or fading causes the target rate to be higher than the achievable (with Gaussian signaling) DF rate [2]. Hence the probability of these events (OP) become an upper bound on the asymptotic error probability.\nThe main contributions are twofold. First, tight approxi- mations for the OP, which lend themselves to analysis, are derived for the small OP regime. Secondly, we determine the optimal relay activation probability (in terms of OP) which provides the trade-off between the reliability gain obtained from cooperation and the interference introduced. From a different perspective, this also addresses the question whether or not to cooperate.\nNotation: (·) ∗ denotes complex conjugation and (·) real part. Γ(z) = ∞ 0 t z−1 e −t dt is the Gamma function. Deﬁne the functions G(x) = 1 − exp(−x); Q m,n (a, b) is the (m, n)\nNuttall-Q function; I n (·) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the n-th kind and erf(a) = 2 π a 0 e −t 2 dt is the error function.\nConsider a planar network in which source nodes attempt to transmit a message to their destinations in the presence of a single \u2013full-duplex\u2013 relay node. The sources are modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) Φ s of intensity λ s , and initially we assume that each source chooses its relay from an independent HPPP Φ in of intensity λ in , although later we shall introduce some simplifying hypothesis. This is equivalent to assuming that nodes from a set Φ forming a HPPP of intensity λ s +λ in choose to access the network using slotted ALOHA [3] with transmit probability λ s /(λ in + λ s ), while the remaining nodes serve as potential relays.\nA central issue is how and whether a source should decide to activate a relay. Obviously, provided that local CSI is available at the sources this must be done taking into account both local criteria, to satisfy the cluster\u2019s needs, but at the same time on a global scale to maximize network throughput. To simplify the treatment we assume that there is no CSI available at the source nodes and hence they choose to activate a relay with a ﬁxed probability p r independent of all other nodes. Another important issue is how a relay is chosen from available nodes. We shall consider two cases:\n\u2022 The relays are at a ﬁxed relative position from their source, that is, the relay for a source node x is positioned at x + k, where k is a ﬁxed vector,\n\u2022 The relays are chosen by the sources from the set of inactive nodes Φ in .\nThe ﬁrst case is considered for mathematical tractability and because the optimal regions where to look for a relay can be derived. With respect to the second case, it is reasonable to assume that sources will choose their relay using whatever little local knowledge of the network they possess. Moreover, since the focus will be on coding schemes that perform better when the relay is closer to the source, we propose that each source that uses a relay will attempt to use its NN from the set Φ in . Although this will be beneﬁcial in most cases, it does not avoid the possibility of two sources choosing the same node as a relay. Nevertheless, assuming a reasonable small outage probability regime the density of sources will be much smaller than that of the potential relays and the probability of conﬂicts will be negligible. With these simpliﬁcations, the existence and location of all the relays becomes independent for each source and we can simply include the position of the NN of each source as a mark, simplifying the model.\nWith the above hypothesis we can model the network as an independently marked Poisson point process:\n\u2022 The positions of the sources constitute the HPPP Φ s = {x i } of intensity λ s mentioned above.\n\u2022 The Bernoulli random variable (RV) δ x i indicates that source x i uses a relay, an event with probability p r .\n\u2022 The NN of source x i is located at x i + k i , where k i is a degenerate RV or with the NN distribution, which for a HPPP is a zero-mean bidimensional Gaussian RV with variance σ 2 in = (2πλ in ) −1 .\n\u2022 All nodes transmit with unit power. The power received at y by a transmitter at x is |h xy | 2 l xy where l xy = x−y −α (α > 2) is the usual path loss function and |h xy | 2 is the power gain of Rayleigh fading with unit mean.\n\u2022 An additional source with the same marks as the oth- ers, independent of the point process ˜ Φ s and with its destination at d = [D, 0], is added at the origin. The position of the relay for this source node will be r (distributed as a degenerate RV or distributed with the NN distribution). The coefﬁcients |h sr | 2 , |h rd | 2 and |h sd | 2 model the source-relay, relay-destination, and source- destination fading coefﬁcients of this cluster, respectively.\n\u2022 h x i r , h k i r and h x i d , h k i d model the fading gains between each source and its relay and the relay of the source at the origin, and between each source and its relay and the destination node of the source at the origin, respectively.\nThe interferences affecting the typical cluster depend on two path losses from each cluster (e.g. at the destination, l x i ,d and l x i +k i ,d ) and for this, the OP cannot be obtained in closed form. Hence, we approximate the path loss from the clusters out of the origin to the relay and destination at the origin by a single path loss: l x i ,d ≈ l x i +k i ,d ≈ l x i +τ k i ,d , and l x i ,r ≈ l x i +k i ,r ≈ l x i +τ k i ,r , with 0 ≤ τ ≤ 1. This assumes that the intra-cluster distance is much smaller than the inter- cluster distance, while retaining the independent fading paths [7]. Interference powers are approximated as:\nA complex Gaussian point-to-point code 1 -C n (n, M n ) for the homogeneous relay network [5] consists of a set of randomly and independently generated codewords {ϕ(1), . . . , ϕ(M n )}, each according to an i.i.d. Gaussian RV of unit variance. We assume each source (resp. to relay) uses a code with each receiver assigning an estimate of its message to the received output. The smallest asymptotic average (over all random parameters) probability of error of every pair source-receiver\nDecode-and-Forward [2] allows the relay to decode the messages sent by the source, re-encode them, and forward them to the destination. The encoder cannot optimize the rate R since it is unaware of the instantaneous interference and\nfading coefﬁcients involved. We will assume that the encoding- decoding scheme used is regular encoding and sliding-window decoding [1] with Gaussian signaling. In this way, the vari- ances of the interferences \u2013conditioned to the marked Poisson process\u2013 are given by (1). Fixed a rate R, the asymptotic error probability ¯ P e (R) is dominated by the outage probability (OP) of any achievable rate. In particular, we focus on the DF scheme, for which\nwhere δ 0 = 1 indicates the source at the origin uses the relay A(R) = |h sr | 2 l sr 1 − |ρ| 2 < T I r ,\nThe event A(R) means that the relay is in outage and the event B(R) means that the destination is in outage when source and relay can cooperate. T = 2 R − 1 and ρ is the complex correlation coefﬁcient between the symbols transmitted by the source and the relay. Although DF allows for the optimization of ρ [6], we shall restrict ourselves to the case ρ = 0. In the small outage regime it can be proved that this is the optimal value [6]. Furthermore, ρ = 0 simpliﬁes the operation of the network, because the source and its relay do not need to transmit synchronously [1].\nLet A DT (R) = |h sd | 2 l sd < T I d denote the event that DT fails. Conditioning on δ 0 we can write the OP as:\nAlthough (2) can be solved (even without the path loss approximation) in terms of the (joint) Laplace transform of the interference RVs [8], they can only be computed numerically [6] and it is difﬁcult to carry out an analysis. To overcome this we introduce the union bound on the DF outage event, which is very tight when the relay is close to the source, since B(R) dominates over A(R). In this way we can write:\nLemma 1 (upper bound on the OP): Assuming the relays are ﬁxed at a relative position r with resp. to the sources, the OP can be upper bounded as follows\n+ (1 − p r )G λ s δD 2 1 + 2p r α\nProof: This follows the same lines in [6] using (1). The ﬁrst term in (4) corresponds to A(R), the second one to A DT (R) and the last one to B(R).\nLemma 2 (optimal relay activation probability): When the relays are ﬁxed, if the destination and relay positions satisfy\nand λ s δ r 2 is small enough, we have that P out (R, p r ) attains its minimum value when p r = 0 or p r = 1.\nProof: Since under (5) the second derivative of the last two terms in (4) is negative, we can show that they are concave functions of p r [9]. When λ s δ r is small, the ﬁrst term, which quantiﬁes the outage behavior of the source-relay link, can be tightly bounded by concave functions of p r ∈ [0, 1] as:\nNotice that the tightness is given by the quality of the source- relay link. If λ s δ r 2 is small enough, (6) will be very tight, and both (4) and the true P out (R, p r ) will be concave. Again, remark that a small λ s δ r 2 is coherent with the use of the path loss approximation, the union bound and condition (5) (the relay will typically be closer to the source than the destination). Finally, a concave function on a bounded and closed interval [x 1 , x 2 ] attains its minimum at x 1 or x 2 .\nThus lemma 2 states that the best OP for any cluster in the network can be attained when all (p r = 1) or none (p r = 0) of the sources decide to use their neighbors as relays. This is somewhat surprising: there is no optimal trade-off between cooperating and introducing interference; cooperating can be beneﬁcial or detrimental to all. Each of these scenarios is determined by the network parameters (α, D, r, λ s , R, etc).\nIn order to obtain more insightful results let us consider that ∆ ≡ λ s δ 1 + 2 α is small, which will be the typical operating regime. Also consider that r ≤ D and r − d\nLemma 3 (small OP regime): As ∆D 2 (and ∆ r − d 2 ) goes to zero we have:\nBy neglecting O max ∆D 2 2 , ∆ r − d 2 2 , the function m(p r ) captures the optimal relay positions very well under the natural and practical assumptions mentioned above.\n\u2022 It is concave when p r ∈ [0, 1] if the relay relative position r is contained in:\n\u2022 Deﬁning η ≡ 2/(2 + α), the value p r = 1 is optimal if the relay relative position r is contained in:\nIt is interesting to observe that B(α, d) ⊂ A(α, d), so in a practical setting, the set of r ∈ R 2 where p r = 1 is optimum is contained in the region where m(p r ) is concave. Also, lim α→∞ B(α, d) = A(α, d) implying that when the path-loss exponent is large enough the two sets coincide.\nIn the previous section the optimal choice of p r depended on the set of parameters (α, λ s CT 2/α 1 + 2 α D 2 , r). In the random relay setup, the position of the relay is different in each cluster, and as we shall see, the optimal choice of p r will depend on the set of parameters: (α, λ s CT 2/α D 2 , σ in /D), that is, it will now depend on the relative distance to neighbors (σ in ) with respect to the transmission distance D. To derive the OP we have to average with respect to δ 0 and the position of the NN of the origin, r. Doing this for ρ = 0, and using the union bound, the OP can be written as:\nwhere we have used that r is independent of δ 0 , and that A DT is independent of r.\nLemma 5 (upper bound on the OP): The OP when the re- lays are selected as the nearest neighbors of each source can be upper bounded as:\nas ˜ δD 2 ≡ λ s δ 1 + 2p r α D 2 → 0, where according to our needs we can use one of the following:\nWe omit the proof due to space limitations. Notice that (9) does not depend on the parameter τ of the path loss approximation. Also, γ(s) is monotonically increasing so its minimum value is lim s→0 γ(s) = π 2 4 π − 1 ≈ 0.3425. In addition, if s ≤ 1/3 it is almost constant and if an upper bound is determined for s then γ(s) can be upper bounded by a constant so (10) can be simpliﬁed to a linear function of\nin (9) we ﬁnd that if λ s δD 2 ≤ 0.38 then (9) will be a concave function of p r ∈ [0, 1], if\nProof: Use (10) in (9), differentiate twice with resp. to p r and ﬁnd conditions on σ in /D for the second derivative to be negative.\nFinally a sufﬁcient condition for p r = 1 to be optimal is given by the following lemma.\nLemma 7 (optimal relay activation probability): When the relays are random, neglecting O (∆D 2 ) 2 in (9) for λ s δD 2 ≤ 0.38 we ﬁnd that if:\nProof: Use (10) in (9), and ﬁnd sufﬁcient conditions and ﬁnd conditions this expression to be smaller than the OP of DT using polynomial bounds.\nObserve that the interval λ s δD 2 ≤ 0.38 in which we determine the values of σ in /D covers the small outage regime (e.g. when λ s δD 2 < 1/4 the OP with DT will be smaller than 0.22 [3]). In addition, in the next section we shall show that in this regime there is large range of σ in /D for which the OP is concave, and in a large subset of this set p r = 1 is optimal, that is, we have identiﬁed the practical setups in which the OP is concave, and a region in which p r = 1 is optimal.\nFig. 1 shows the OP for the ﬁxed relay case for d = [10 0] when the relay is at r = [3 3] and r = [5 4]. The curves labeled as exact were obtained through numerical simulation of the exact expressions of the OP for this case, which do not have a closed form expression, while the approximations come from (4). The performance of DT (independent of p r ) is also shown. We see that (4) is very tight for practical OP values and that when the relay is sufﬁciently close to the source (r = [3 3]) all sources should use DF, while when the relay is farther away (r = [5 4]) they should use DT. This is because as the relay is farther away from the source the OP associated with the relay decoding, although small, has a greater inﬂuence. Hence, interference is introduced in the network, but the cooperation is insufﬁcient to diminish its effect. In Fig. 2 we see the boundary of the regions where the relays have to be so that p r = 1 is optimal, obtained using the exact outage probability, the approximate expression (4) and function m(p r ). We see that the obtained simpliﬁed expressions are in excellent agreement with the true behavior given by the exact expressions.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the OP as a function of p r when the relays are chosen as the nearest neighbors of the sources using d = [10 0], α = 4 and λ s = 10 −4 for two different values of σ in : one in which p r = 1 is optimal and another in which p r = 0. We compare them against Montecarlo simulations of the Poisson process, which was simulated from the model without the path loss approximation. We see that in particular using (11) in (9) yields the best approximation to the OP. Finally in Fig. (4) we ﬁx α = 3 and ﬁnd the set of points (λ s δD 2 , σ in ) for which the OP is a concave function in p r and for which p r = 1 is optimal, both through numerical simulation of the exact OP and using (12) and (13). We see on one hand that these expressions cover the small outage regime (e.g. when λ s δD 2 < 0.1 the OP with DT will be smaller than 0.1 [3]) and that they predict quite well the actual regions of concavity on the OP an the region of optimality of p r = 1.\nIn this paper we discussed the limits of cooperation on homogeneous wireless relay networks. The most signiﬁcant contribution of the work is the conclusion, that in the small OP regime using DF, and depending of certain network parameters, it is best to cooperate or not at all for all the clusters in the network. That is, there is no overall gain if some clusters are permitted to cooperate and others not. This result follows from the fact that when a cluster decides to use a relay it will introduce more interference in the network. While,\nin some scenarios, the beneﬁt of cooperation will diminish the effect of the added interference, in others that will not be case."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"G. Kramer"},{"name":"M.
