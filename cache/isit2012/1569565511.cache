The messages are transmitted over a family of parallel degraded broadcast channels. In the most general case, there are six parallel degraded broadcast channels with different orders of degradedness. We determine the capacity region for two classes of broadcast channels, one with ﬁve parallel degraded broadcast channels and the other with three parallel degraded broadcast channels. The main difﬁculty is in identifying the relevant auxiliary random variables in the proofs of the converse. To accomplish this, we make use of an information theoretic inequality that can be proven using the Csisz´ar-sum identity."},"body":{"text":"to be decoded by all three receivers and M 2 is the message to be decoded by receivers 2 and 3 (see [3, Prop. 10]). It is also capacity achieving when Y is a less noisy receiver than W and also Z is a less noisy receiver than W (see [3, Prop. 11]).\nHowever, the capacity region of the general three-user BC with three-degraded message sets remain unresolved. One of the main difﬁculties is in extending the Csisz´ar-sum identity from the two-user case to the three-user case.\nIn this paper, we prove that the achievable rate region is also tight for a new class of three-user BCs, where the degraded messages are transmitted over the product of a family of parallel degraded BCs (we note that the product BC is not a degraded BC). The most general case consists of the product of the following degraded BCs:\nX 1 → Z 1 → Y 1 → W 1 , \t (1) X 2 → Y 2 → Z 2 → W 2 , \t (2) X 3 → W 3 → Z 3 → Y 3 , \t (3) X 4 → W 4 → Y 4 → Z 4 , \t (4) X 5 → Y 5 → W 5 → Z 5 , \t (5) X 6 → Z 6 → W 6 → Y 6 . \t (6)\nIn fact, any family of parallel degraded three-user BCs can be decomposed into the above six subchannels.\nIn this paper, we characterize the capacity region for two sub-classes of the most general case. Speciﬁcally, we are able to give a single letter characterization of the capacity region for the BC which consists of the product of the subchannels (1)-(5) as well as for the BC which consists of the product of the subchannels (1)-(2) and (6). Though we are not able to characterize the capacity region of the most general\nwhere (a) follows from the Csisz´ar-sum identity. We bound the last term in (10) as follows:\nwhere (a) follows from (7). Finally, we combine (10) and (11). The second inequality can be proven accordingly.\nRemark 1: We note that the Markov chains X → Z → ˜ Z and X → Z → Y must hold in order to prove Lemma 1. The Csisz´ar-sum identity alone is insufﬁcient to prove Lemma 1 for all distributions on X, Y, Z, ˜ Z .\nWe can now state the capacity theorem for the ﬁrst class of three-user parallel degraded BC:\nTheorem 1: The capacity region, C π, 1 , of a discrete mem- oryless three-receiver BC, with three degraded message sets, consisting of the product of ﬁve parallel degraded BCs given by (1)-(5) consists of the set of all rate triplets (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) satisfying\nR 1 ≤ t 1 + I (X 3 ; W 3 ) + I (X 4 ; W 4 ) + I (U 5 ; W 5 ) \t (12) R 1 + R 2 ≤ t 2 + I (U 3 ; Y 3 ) + I (X 4 ; Y 4 ) + I (X 5 ; Y 5 ) (13) R 1 + R 2 ≤ t 3 + I (X 3 ; W 3 ) + I (X 4 ; W 4 ) + I (U 5 ; W 5 )\n+ I (X 5 ; Y 5 |U 5 ) \t (14) R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ≤ t 4 + I (X 3 ; Z 3 ) + I (X 4 ; Z 4 )\n+ I (X 5 ; Z 5 ) \t (15) R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ≤ t 5 + I (X 3 ; W 3 ) + I (X 4 ; W 4 )\nt 1 = I (U 1 ; W 1 ) + I (U 2 ; W 2 ) t 2 = I (V 1 ; Y 1 ) + I (X 2 ; Y 2 )\nt 3 = I (U 1 ; W 1 ) + I (V 1 ; Y 1 |U 1 ) + I (U 2 ; W 2 ) + I (X 2 ; Y 2 |U 2 )\nt 5 = I (U 1 ; W 1 ) + I (X 1 ; Z 1 |U 1 ) + I (U 2 ; W 2 ) + I (X 2 ; Z 2 |U 2 )\nt 7 = I (U 1 ; W 1 ) + I (V 1 ; Y 1 |U 1 ) + I (X 1 ; Z 1 |V 1 ) + I (U 2 ; W 2 ) + I (X 2 ; Y 2 |U 2 )\nV 2 = ((U 1 , V 1 ) , (U 2 , X 2 ) , U 3 , X 4 , (U 5 , X 5 )) V 3 = (U 1 , U 2 , (U 3 , X 3 ) , X 4 , U 5 ) .\nTo prove the inequality (16), we consider the following: I M 1 ; W N 1 + I M 2 , M 3 ; Z N 1 |M 1\nThe other inequalities above follow from standard properties of mutual information and the order of degradedness for each of the subchannels.\nI M 1 ; W N 2 |W N 1 + I M 2 ; Y N 2 |M 1 , Y N 1 + I M 3 ; Z N 2 |M 1 , M 2 , Z N 1\n≤ I M 1 , W N 1 ; W N 2 + I M 2 ; Y N 2 |M 1 , Y N 1 + I X N 2 ; Y N 2 |M 1 , M 2 , Y N 1\nwhere (a) follows from Lemma 1 and the degradedness order of the subchannels.\nCombining (27)-(31), we obtain (18) by setting V 1,n = M 1 , M 2 , W n− 1 1,1 , Y n− 1 1,1 and by making using of the same\ntime-sharing random variable Q. Furthermore, we note that U 1,n → V 1,n → X 1,n forms a Markov chain.\nThe rest of the terms may also be derived by setting U 3,n = M 1 , M 2 , Z N 1 , Y N 2 , Y n− 1 3,1 . Finally, we observe that the capacity region is not increased by admitting more general input probability distributions.\nRemark 2: It is interesting to note that even though U 5 → X 5 → W 5 → Z 5 forms a Markov chain, receiver 1 (W ) only decodes part of the message (represented by U 5 ) transmitted through the subchannel 5. Receiver 3, however, decodes the full message (represented by X 5 ) even though Z 5 is a degraded version of W 5 .\nRemark 3: In the course of our work, we noticed that the converse could not be proven if the subchannels are expanded in the wrong sequence. In this paper, we have expanded the subchannels sequentially (see (22)-(26) and (27)-(31)).\nRemark 4: We also note that the Csisz´ar-sum identity as well as Lemma 1 were crucial in the proof of the converse. In fact, going through the proof shows that the converse holds as long as X 5 → Y 5 → W 5 and X 5 → Y 5 → Z 5 form Markov chains. No order of degradedness is necessary between W 5 and Z 5 as this was also the assumption in Lemma 1.\nTheorem 2: The capacity region, C π, 2 , of a discrete mem- oryless three-receiver BC, with three degraded message sets, consisting of the product of three parallel degraded BCs given by (1)-(2) and (6) consists of the set of all rate triplets (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) satisfying\nR 1 ≤ t 1 + I (U 6 ; W 6 ) \t (32) R 1 + R 2 ≤ t 2 + I (V 6 ; Y 6 ) \t (33) R 1 + R 2 ≤ t 3 + I (U 6 ; W 6 ) + I (V 6 ; Y 6 |U 6 ) \t (34) R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ≤ t 4 + I (X 6 ; Z 6 ) \t (35) R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ≤ t 5 + I (U 6 ; W 6 ) + I (X 6 ; Z 6 |U 6 ) (36) R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ≤ t 6 + I (V 6 ; Y 6 ) + I (X 6 ; Z 6 |V 6 ) \t (37) R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ≤ t 7 + I (U 6 ; W 6 ) + I (V 6 ; Y 6 |U 6 )\n+ I (X 6 ; Z 6 |V 6 ) \t (38) 2R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ≤ t 8 + I (U 6 ; W 6 ) + I (V 6 ; Y 6 )\n≤ I M 1 , Y N 1 , Z N 2 ; W N 6 + I M 2 , Y N 2 ; Y N 6 |M 1 , Y N 1 , Z N 2 + I X N 6 ; Z N 6 |M 1 , M 2 , Y N (1→2) , Z N 2\ndegraded message sets instead of two and we consider a product channel rather than the general case.\nRemark 6: Even though the Csisz´ar-sum identity cannot be extended to three users in general, we are able to obtain (41) through Lemma 1 (as well as the the Csisz´ar-sum identity) as both W 6 and Y 6 are degraded versions of Z 6 . In fact, going through the converse proof, one can show that the capacity region still holds as long as this is true. No order of degradedness is necessary between W 6 and Y 6 .\nIn this paper, we give single letter characterizations of two classes of parallel degraded BCs. There are three necessary components in the proofs of these two classes of channels.\nThe ﬁrst critical component is in the proof of the achiev- ability for the ﬁrst class of channels, where we allow receiver 1 to decode only part of the message (represented by U 5 ) in subchannel 5 and allowing receiver 3 to decode the full message (represented by X 5 ) even though Z 5 is a degraded version of W 5 . Similarly, a critical part in the proof of the achievability for the second class of channels involves allowing receiver 1 to decode U 6 in subchannel 6 and allowing receiver 2 to decode (U 6 , V 6 ) even though Y 6 is a degraded version of W 6 . The second critical component is in the proof of the converse, where we must expand the subchannels in the correct sequence. The third critical component follows from the fact that the Csisz´ar-sum identity cannot be extended to three users in general. We introduce an information theoretic inequality that allows us to bypass this difﬁculty for the product channels considered.\nHowever, we are still unable to characterize the capacity region for the most general case. Whether this is due to the best inner bound being non-capacity achieving, or due to the wrong choice of input probability distributions, or due to the lack of techniques to prove the converse remains to be in seen. Nonetheless, our results encompass a large class of parallel degraded BCs. In a subsequent work, we make use of the results here to characterize the capacity region of some classes of spectral Gaussian BC with three receivers and three- degraded message sets."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"J.
