In this paper, we derive the closed-form expressions for the Gallager\u2019s random coding and expurgated error exponents for Rayleigh fading product multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels under the assumption that there is no channel-state information (CSI) at the transmitter and perfect CSI at the receiver.

In addition, we derive the exact closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity and cutoff rate based on easily computable Meijer G-function.

This function is called reliability or error exponent of a communication system [2] and deﬁned as\nwhere P opt e (R, N ) is the average error probability of the optimal code of length N and rate R [3]. This expression tries to ﬁnd the supremum of function E (R), which is difﬁcult to compute. In [4], Gallager has given an easily computable lower bound. Following his work, the exact numerical expression of error exponent can be found and is well known as the ran- dom coding error exponent (RCEE) or Gallager\u2019s exponent. The RCEE was studied for single-input single-output (SISO) and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) Rayleigh ﬂat fading channels with average or peak power constraint in [5] and [6],\nrespectively. More recently, the exact closed-form expressions for the random coding error exponent, cutoff rate and critical rate have been derived in [2] in case of MIMO Rayleigh ﬂat fading channels. The expurgated error exponent was studied in [7] in case of a point-to-point discrete memoryless channel and shown that the expurgated exponent bounds are greater than or equal to the exponent of the RCEE bounds for all rate pairs. The prior works have profoundly improved our knowledge on this topic, but all of the works have ignored the product fading model.\nIn this paper, we derive the exact expressions for the random coding and expurgated error exponents of Rayleigh fading product MIMO channel [8]. These analytical expressions are based on the well known Gamma and Hypergeometric func- tions, and can be used to ﬁnd the necessary codeword length to achieve the predeﬁned error probability at a given rate below the MIMO channels capacity. Moreover, we derive the closed- form expressions for the ergodic capacity and cutoff rate for the proposed model.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The system model is described in Section II. The formulation of random coding error exponent, expurgated error exponent, ergodic capacity and cutoff rate illustrated Section III. Section IV describes the numerical results of this paper. Finally, Section V provides the concluding remarks of this work.\nWe consider a MIMO communication system with n t transmit antennas and n r receive antennas, where the channel remains constant for T c symbol periods and changes indepen- dently to a new value for each coherence time. We consider the channel coding over N b independent coherence intervals. Therefore, for an observation interval of N b T c symbol periods, the received signal is a sequence of {Y 1 , Y 2 , . . . , Y N b } and given by\nn t H k X k + W k , k = 1, 2, . . . , N b . \t (16) where Y k ∈ C n r ×T c and X k ∈ C n t ×T c are the received and transmitted signal matrices, respectively, H k ∈ C n r ×n t are the channel matrices and W k ∼ ˜ N n r ,T c (0, N 0 I n r ⊗ I T c ) are the additive white Gaussian noise matrices. We consider that H k represent the Rayleigh fading product MIMO channels and is expressed as H k = 1 √ n\nH k,2 ∈ C n s ×n t are the random matrices with the number of n s scatterers. In the Rayleigh fading environment, the entries of H k,1 and H k,2 are assumed to be independent and follow the distribution CN (0, 1). The channel is power limited in the scene that E X \u2020 X ≤ P , where P corresponds to the total transmit power over n t antennas and E [ ·] is the expectation operator.\nFrom [9], the probability density function (pdf) of unordered eigenvalues for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channels is given by\nwhere ∞ > x 1 ≥ · · · ≥ x m ≥ 0, λ = (λ 1 , . . . , λ m ), x = (x 1 , . . . , x m ), u = min(n r , n s ), v = max(n r , n s ), m = min(u, n t ), n = max(u, n t ) and\n    \n    \n( −1) u−j (v − m − n + i + j − 2)!n −(v−m−n+i+j−1) s \t , if j = m + 1, · · · , u.\n(5) {Ξ(x)} i,j = x j−1 i , i = 1, . . . , m; j = 1, . . . , m. \t (6)\nwhere K υ ( ·) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind [10].\nand σ 2 ξ = X [tr(XX \u2020 ) − T c P ] 2 p X (X)dX. The random coding error exponent denoted by E r (p X (X), R, T c ) is given by\nWe \t suppose \t that \t p X (X) \t = π −n t T c det(Q) −T c etr ( −Q −1 XX \u2020 ) is the capacity- achieving distribution subject to the power constraint, X ∼ ˜ N n t ·T c (0, Q ⊗ I n t ) and tr(Q) ≤ P . p H (H) and p (Y |X, H) denote the distributions of channel and received signal [2], respectively. We consider equal power allocation to each transmit antenna, i.e. Q = P n\nI n t and deﬁne β = n t −rP . In this case, E 0 (p X (X), ρ, r, T c ) and E r (p X (X), R, T c ) are denoted by ˜ E 0 (ρ, β, T c ) and E r (R, T c ), respectively. Therefore, for the Rayleigh fading product MIMO channels, ˜ E 0 (ρ, β, T c ) is given by\nwhere γ denotes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and K(ρ, β) = (1 + ρ)(n t − β) + n t (1 + ρ) ln β n t . Using the following identity,\nand the pdf of (3), the random coding error exponent for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channels, E r (R, T c ), is given by\nwhere b i,j is shown in (14) at the bottom of this page and c i,j is given by\nWhen n s = 1, then we have u = m = 1, v = n r , n = n t and we get the error exponent for Rayleigh fading keyhole MIMO channel. Therefore, the expression of RCEE for Rayleigh fading keyhole MIMO channel is given by\nwhere β ∗ (ρ) is the solution of ∂ ˜ E 0 (ρ,β,N c ) ∂β \t = 0 for all ρ ≥ 1 and is always in the range 0 < β ≤ n T . The value of R at ρ = 0 (i.e. β ∗ (0) = n T ) is the ergodic capacity of the channel and given by\nwhere Θ HH \u2020 . The marginal pdf of an unordered eigen- value λ of Θ is given by [11]\nwhere K 3 = ( u l=1 Γ(u − l + 1)Γ(v − l + 1)) −1 and D i,j is the (i, j)-th cofactor of u × u matrix Θ whose (m, n)-th entry is given by {Θ} m,n = Γ(v − u + m + n − 1). Using the pdf of (17) and the identity of [10, Eq. (7.821.3)], we obtain the ergodic capacity for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channel\n(18) When n s = 1, we obtain the ergodic capacity for Rayleigh\n1, 0 \t . (19) D. Cutoff Rate\nThe value of ˜ E o (ρ, β, T c ) at ρ = 1 and β = n t is the cutoff rate [2] of the channel and given by\nwhere b R 0 i,j is shown in (22) at the bottom of this page. With n s = 1, the cutoff rate for Rayleigh fading keyhole MIMO channel is given by\nWe obtain the RCEE by selecting codewords independently according to same input distribution. Since the codeword selection is unbiased, the good codewords and bad codewords contribute equally to the overall average error probability. Therefore, as is well known, the random coding bound can be improved by expurgating the bad codewords from the code ensemble at low rates. The direct extension of Gallager\u2019s result on the expurgated bound is given by,\nwhere o (1) → 0 when N b → ∞. The expurgated error exponent E ex (p X (X), R, T c ) is deﬁned as E ex (p X (X), R, T c ) = max\n{max r≥0 E x (p X (X), ρ, r, T c ) − ρR} (25)\nHere X denote the input signal of good codewords and has the same distribution as X. Similar to (10), we have\n. The expurgated error exponent for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channel, E ex (R, T c ), is given by\nwhere b i,j is shown in (30) at the bottom of this page. With n s = 1, The expurgated error exponent for Rayleigh fading keyhole MIMO channel is given by\n× det(ψ 1,1 ) − ρR \t (31) where\nFig.1 shows the effect of antenna diversity on the random coding error exponent E r (R, T c ) and expurgated error expo- nent E ex (R, T c ) for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channel as a function of rate R. We see that for a certain antenna con- ﬁguration, both the error exponent E r (R, T c ) and E ex (R, T c ) decrease with rate R as one expects. Since the improved antenna diversity by increasing n s , n t and n r decreases the probability of error, therefore, both the error exponents are found to increase with n s , n t and n r . It is observed that although error exponents increase with n s , n t and n r but the effect of n t and n r on the error exponents is more signiﬁcant than n s . Similar effect of antenna diversity is observed on the cutoff rate as illustrated in Fig.2. But the cutoff rate increases with SNR.\nFig.3 shows the error probability, P r e and P ex e , for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channel as a function of R for selected values of T c . We see that error probability increases with T c\nwhich in turn causes an reduction in the error exponent as one expects. Therefore, in order to maintain a ﬁxed SNR with a certain power allocation and noise variance, code length should be increased with T c which is illustrated in Table I and II. It should be noted that Table I and II show the effects of increasing SNR and T c on the required code lengths for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channel with n r = n t = n s = 2 in order to achieve the decoding error probabilities P r e ≤ 10 −6 and P ex e ≤ 10 −6 , respectively at a transmission rate 2.0 bits/symbol. In both the tables, we see that coding complexity decreases with SNR and increases with T c . But the decreasing rate is not constant, For example, as illustrated in Table I, increasing SNR from 11dB to 12dB reduces the 26.7% of the code length but the code length reduces only 10.5% when SNR increases from 19dB to 20dB.\nIn this paper, we derive the closed form analytical expres- sions for the random coding error exponent, expurgated error exponent, ergodic capacity and cutoff rate for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channels in order to investigate the tradeoff between communication reliability and information rate. The analytical results are veriﬁed via Monte-Carlo simulation. Matching between the simulation and analytical results justify\nthe validity of derived expressions. Also, we present some numerical results to clear the insight of derived expression. Based on our formulation and from the observation of nu- merical results, we can conclude that by expurgating the bad codewords from the code ensemble, expurgated error exponent shows an improved result as compared to the random coding error exponent. In order to maintain a ﬁxed SNR with a certain power allocation and noise variance, code length should be increased with the symbol coherence time. On the other hand, for a ﬁxed symbol coherence time, coding complexity decreases with SNR but the decreasing rate is low in the high SNR regime."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C. E.
