It is an extension of constantly rebalanced portfolio (CRP) in universal portfolio introduced by Cover[3]. It is a certain type of hidden Markov model and allows time dependency in stock\u2019s price data. We showed that the minimax log wealth ratio of the CMP equals the minimax coding regret of the underlying Markov model in CMP [12], and proposed an efﬁcient approximation algorithm of universal strategy for CMP using Baum-Welch algorithm.\nPortfolio theory has been studied in several ﬁelds, such as ﬁ- nance, Bayes theory, game theory, information theory, etc. Re- lated to information theory, Cover[3], Cover & Ordentlich[4], Cross & Barron[7], etc. have studied this topic. Cover intro- duced a model of portfolio referred to as universal portfolio. It has the similar formulation as universal data compression with coding regret[9], [11], [14]. Cover and Ordentlich [4] gave the minimax wealth ratio and the minimax strategy for the problem, where they assumed the class of portfolios referred to as constantly rebalanced portfolios (CRP).\nAs the ﬁrst result of our study on property of the CMP, we show an exact computation algorithm of the portfolio of Bayes strategy with Dirichlet prior for CMP, which is an extension of the similar algorithm for CRP [4]. Then we provide a further generalized notion of CMP, which we name Generalized CMP (GCMP), taking advantage of our understanding that CMP and CRP are hidden Markov models.\nAs an application of CMP, we study the problem of uni- versal portfolio with side information, and propose a strategy which utilizes price relatives themselves by adding the option of cash as the an additional stock. This modiﬁcation of universal portfolio has been considered in several literatures [4], [7], [8]. However we consider the different problem in which the investors don\u2019t invest in cash, they just utilize\nthe information of cash. Since the usual universal portfolio is determined based on ratios between the price relatives of stocks in a market. That is, cash\u2019s price can be used as side information. For this problem, we utilize the GCMP since simple application of CMP in our problem does not work well. It is due to the fact that each hidden state represents that the correspondent stock is most promising, i.e. each state is tied up with a particular stock. This fairly restricts freedom of the state transition map of the underlying Markov model. This can be solved by employing the GCMP in which the states are deﬁned independently of the set of stocks. By this extension, the GCMP can provide a chance to obtain a better portfolio than the CMP. We show that the GCMP with side information work well in some simulations.\nAs precedent research of universal portfolio with side information, Cover[4], Cross & Barron[7] and Fujita & Kawabata[8], etc. are known. In Cross & Barron[7], an upper bound on wealth ratio O(n d ) is shown, where d is the dimension of the target class.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review universal portfolios[3] and CMP[12]. In Section III, we present an exact computation algorithm of Bayes strategy for CMP. We introduce GCMP in Section IV and propose a method of universal portfolio with side information using GCMP in Section V. Further, we show an efﬁcient approximation algorithm for our method and the results of some experiments in Section VI.\nLet us consider a stock market which consists of m stocks. Describe the market by series of m-dimensional vectors {x i }, where jth element x ij of x i denotes the price relative of jth stock. The price relative x ij is a ratio of jth stock\u2019s price at the end of the ith day to that at the beginning of the day. The investor\u2019s strategy (portfolio) is speciﬁed by a portfolio vector, which is a non-negative valued vector b normalized as\n= 1. Let B denote the class B = {b ∈ m , b j ≥ 0, m j=1 b j = 1}. The portfolio vector\u2019s jth element denotes a fraction of the capital invested in the jth stock to the whole capital invested in all m stocks. Then, b·x i denotes the growth rate of the whole capital (wealth relative) at the ith day.\nDeﬁne a series of functions S n (x n |b) = n i=1 b · x i , then it denotes the wealth the investor has at the nth day, provided that he had the wealth of the amount 1 at the beginning of the 1st day, and that he dealt everyday so as to keep his portfolio\nas b. This strategy is referred to as constantly rebalanced portfolio (CRP). If he knew the behaviour of the stock market x n in advance, he could optimize b so that S n (x n |b) was maximized. Let ˆ b denote the optimal value of b given x n . The portfolio ˆ b is referred to as optimal constantly rebalanced portfolio. However, to ﬁnd ˆ b in advance is impossible.\nThe goal of universal portfolio is to approach the optimal constantly rebalanced portfolio without the knowledge about x n . The real portfolio should be determined by the past observations. Such a portfolio strategy is referred to as causal portfolio, which is a series of portfolio vectors {β(x i )}, where β(x i ) is the portfolio for the i + 1th day and is determined based on the past observations x i = x 1 · · · x i .\nCover considered the minimax problem for the following wealth ratio:\nwhere we let S n (x n |β) = n i=1 β(x i−1 ) · x i , which is the wealth growth rate by {β(x i )}.\nHere, we review the stochastic interpretation of universal portfolios [12], i.e. we review the notion of wealth density.\nThe range of each element of the stock market vector x i is [0 , ∞). Recall that we concern the wealth ratio which remains unchanged even if we multiply x i in both numerator and denominator by a common constant. Hence, for the problem of universal portfolio in which x i \u2019s are normalized as m j=1 x ij = 1, the wealth ratio is the same one as for the original problem. Hence, we can restrict the range of the price relatives to the set T m = {x ∈ m , x j ≥ 0, m j=1 x j = 1}. Deﬁne the probability density functions of portfolios by nor- malizing wealth growth rate function as the integration with T m is 1, that is, we have\nWe refer to ˜ S(x|b) as a wealth density. We also use the notation ˜ S n (x n |b) = (m!) n S n (x n |b). For the wealth density of causal portfolio β, we write ˜ S n (x n |β) = (m!) n n i=1 β(x i−1 ) · x i .\nWe review the notation of the parametric portfolio [12]. We deﬁne a parametric model of densities of y n , G = {p(·|θ) : θ ∈ Θ}, where Θ is the parameter space of m dimensions. Note that there exists a series β θ (x i−1 ) such that the following holds for any x n ∈ T m n\nNote that m j=1 β θ,j (x i−1 ) = 1 and β θ (x i−1 ) · x i = m\nIf we consider the special case that the model of p(y n |θ) is Bernoulli, then CRP is induced as the wealth density. Here, these expressions show that ˜ S n (x n |β) is a model with latent variables y n . When q is a probability mass function of the Bernoulli or the Markov chains, (7) can be interpreted as an hidden Markov model (HMM).\nNote that Cover\u2019s minimax strategy for CRP can be ap- proximated by the Bayes strategy using the Jeffreys prior. The minimax strategy is given as\nwhere m n (y n ) is the NML for the Bernoulli model. Let M B = {Ber(·|θ) : m i=1 θ i = 1, θ i ≥ 0, i ∈ Y}, where θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ m ). The approximation is given as\nwhere μ J (θ) ∝ m i=1 θ −1/2 i \t is the Jeffreys prior for the Bernoulli model.\nIn [12], we introduced a new target class of universal port- folio named constant Markov portfolios (CMP) by assuming that G is the class of the ﬁxed order Markov chains. Here, we review it for the case of the ﬁrst order Markov chain. Let η y|s denote the conditional probability that y ∈ Y succeeds after s ∈ Y, i.e. we assume that y∈Y η y|s = 1 and η y|s ≥ 0. For each s ∈ Y, let η s denote the vector ( η 1|s , · · · , η m|s ) T and η the vector ( η T 1 , η T 2 , · · · , η T m ). Let p(y n |y 0 , η) = p(y n |η) (y 0 is omitted) denote the probability that y n occurs after the initial symbol y 0 , then we have p(y n |y 0 , η) = n t=1 η y t |y t−1 . In this\ncase, we can write ˜ S n (x n |β η ) and β η as follows, ˜ S n (x n |β\nwhich j is the stock\u2019s index number. In the case of CMP, we obtained a recursive formula for β(x n ),\nThis is the weighted mean of η j|1 , . . . , η j|m by the weights proportional to β (i−1) η,1 x i−1,1 , . . . , β (i−1) η,m x i−1,m , which are the growth rate by each stock respectively.\nWe consider the approximation of the Bayes strategy with the MDL estimator for parameter estimation, which is shown for curved exponential families [10]. Though models of CRP and CMP are not curved exponential families, we could conjecture that the following holds for CRP:\nwhere μ (α) (θ) = m i=1 θ −(1+α)/2 i \t and ˆ θ α denotes the max- imizer of ˜ S n (x n |β θ )μ (α) (θ)/μ (0) (θ). It can be extended to CMP case, though we have to use the Dirichlet prior instead of the Jeffreys prior. We can efﬁciently calculated it by applying the Baum-Welch algorithm (See [1] for example). For evaluation of this method, see [13].\nAssume that the number of stocks m is 2 in this section. We present an algorithm for the exact computation of the μ-weighted CMP where μ(η) = s∈{0,1} i∈{0,1} η −1/2 i|s\nwhich equals the Dirichlet (1 /2, 1/2) distribution by extending Cover\u2019s algorithm for that of CRP [4].\nTheorem 1: Suppose y 0 = u and y n = v. Deﬁne the type s = {n 00 , n 01 , n 10 , n 11 } for the Markov model p(·|·, η), where n ij denotes the number of occurrences of j ∈ Y after i ∈ Y. Let k = n 00 and l = n 01 . ( n 10 = l + u − v, n 11 = n − k − 2l − (u − v)) Then, the nth day\u2019s portfolio can be written as\nn 2 V n−1 (r, l − 1, u, 0), where r = n − 2l − (u − 1). The proof is omitted.\nThe computation time of this algorithm is O(n m ), while that of the Baum-Welch method is O(m 2 n) per iteration. Therefore, we can expect that the Baum-Welch method is faster than this algorithm for large m.\nWe introduce a new target class GCMP in order to use it with our problem of universal portfolio with side information, which we discuss in the next section. We use the information of cash\u2019s price as side information. Recall that we consider the problem in which we don\u2019t invest in cash. This generalization is necessary, because simple application of CMP does not work well in our problem as discussed later in Section V.\nIn the original CMP, the density κ(x|y) is proportional to the price relative of the yth stock (recall (4)), so the number of states equals m. Here, we generalizes the states so that they are independent of the stocks. Note that the number of states, denoted as m s , is not equal to that of stocks in general. This means that κ(x|y) should be generalized. In fact, we deﬁne new κ(x|y, a) as\nThe κ(x|y, a) can represent an arbitrary wealth density pro- vided that a is the parameter with the restriction 0 ≤ a ij ≤ 1, m j=1 a ij = 1, ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , m s }, ∀j ∈ {1, . . . , m}. Letting ξ = (a ij , η), we deﬁne the wealth density of the GCMP as\nHere, we consider the design of causal portfolio determined by a GCMP in a particular case of m = 3 and m s = 2. We can write the strategy of the ith day as\nwhere w i (y i |x i−1 , ξ) is the conditional distribution of y i given x i−1 and w i (y i |x i−1 , ξ) is deﬁned as\nFor w i (y|ξ) = w i (y i |x i−1 , ξ), we can show a recursive formula as well as β(x i−1 ) of CMP,\nHere, the wealth density of GCMP can be written ˜ S n (x n |β ξ ) = (3!) n\nwhere z = (y, j), p(z n |θ) = \t n i=1 p(z i |z i−1 , θ), and p(z|z , θ) = θ z|z = η y|y a yj . Note that the range of the θ is (T d ) d , where d = m · m s . This model is a kind of the parametric portfolio. By applying Theorem 1 of [12], we obtain the following theorem.\nTheorem 2: The minimax wealth ratio of the GCMP is ˜ S n (x n |β ˆ\nwhere p(j n |θ) = y n p(z n |θ) = y n p((y, j) n |θ) and ˜ θ(j n ) = arg max θ p(j n |θ).\nIn this section, we present a strategy which utilizes the side information by adding the option of cash as the m+1th stock. Hereafter, we assume m = 2 and treat the GCMP of m s = 2. As mentioned before, the usual model of universal portfolio uses the ratio of each stock\u2019s price relative only.\nHowever, there is a possibility that strategies depending on the stock\u2019s price itself performs better. Therefore, we consider a new strategy by adding cash option as a side information to GCMP, because the ratio between the price of each stock and cash includes the information of stock\u2019s price relative itself. We show the concrete idea of our new strategy below.\nLet x denote the price relative vector consisting of two stocks and cash, assuming x 3 denotes the price relative of cash. Though x 3 = 1 in the usual setting, x 3 is less than or equals 1 in our setting, because we normalize x as x 1 + x 2 + x 3 = 1. Let ˜ x denote (x 1 , x 2 )/(x 1 + x 2 ), and deﬁne s = x 3 . We call s side information. Note that x = ((1 − s)˜ x 1 , (1 − s)˜ x 2 , s).\nHere, let ¯ x denote the price relative vector of two stocks which is not normalized. When ¯ x i = (1, 1/2) and ¯x i+1 = (2, 1), then ˜x = (2/3, 1/3) for both cases, which doesn\u2019t contain price information itself.\nIf we let ¯ x denote the price relative vector consisting of two stocks and cash which is not normalized, then ¯ x i = (1, 1/2, 1) and ¯ x i+1 = (2, 1, 1) for the above example. Then we have x i = (2/5, 1/5, 2/5) and x i+1 = (1/2, 1/4, 1/4), which conserve the price information. By this, x with small (large) x 3 can represent that the business is good (bad). Here, we consider the problem that when the business is good (bad), the price of ﬁrst (second) stock is likely to be large (small). However, this situation cannot be represented by the model of CMP, because the state transition map is fairly restricted as mentioned in Introduction.\nWhen we design the strategy of GCMP by using the price relative of two stocks and cash, we get the three dimensional portfolio vector β = (β 1 , β 2 , β 3 ), where β 3 is the fraction of assets invested in cash. However, we concern the portfolio in which we can invest our assets only in the real two stocks. Therefore, we deﬁne the portfolio vector of the ith day ˜ β (i) ξ ,\nwhere β ξ = β ξ (˜ x n−1 , s n−1 ) is determined by (11) and (13). Therefore, we deﬁne the wealth density for n days as\nThen, we can obtain the optimal parameter ξ with this case: ˆ ξ = arg max\nWe consider the universal portfolio with the target class deﬁned by ξ. By these formulation, we can obtain the strategy which makes use of the information of stock\u2019s price in itself.\nHere, we consider the universal strategy for GCMP with side information. Deﬁne the estimate ˆ ξ α of the parameter ξ as the maximizer of\nHere, we give an efﬁcient algorithm to compute the maxi- mization (18). First, we estimate η, a y1 and a y2 using Baum- Welch algorithm for 3-stocks\u2019 GCMP with ﬁxing a y3 . As for η, we employ this result as the ﬁnal estimate. Further, we re- estimate a y1 and a y2 by maximizing (18) with ﬁxing η and a y3 . Here, the objective function can be written as,\nWe will consider the maximization of the logarithm of (19): log P (x t |ξ) = t\nFor that purpose, we introduce Q(ξ, ξ old ) similarly as the ordinary EM algorithm:\nwhere μ (α) = μ (α) (ξ), p t (x i , y, z|ξ) = p t (x i , y, z|x i−1 , ξ) and\nHere, we consider the optimization of a 11 , a 12 , a 21 , a 22 with ﬁxing a 13 , a 23 , and η. We rewrite (22) as,\nQ(ξ, ξ old ) = ¯ F (ξ) + const, where ¯ F (ξ) = F (ξ) + G(ξ) and we deﬁne\nSince it is difﬁcult to maximize ¯ F (ξ), we consider the maxi- mization of F (ξ). It gives the new parameter value as\nHowever, there is a possibility of reducing Q(ˆ ξ, ξ old ) from Q(ξ old , ξ old ). Therefore, we should revise ˆa yz in this case. We consider the Taylor expansion for ¯ F around ˆ ξ.\n∂ξ (ξ − ˆξ) ∼ 1 2 ∂ 2 F (ξ) ∂ξ 2 ξ − ˆ ξ + ∂G(ξ) ∂ξ ∂ 2 F (ξ) ∂ξ 2 2 + const.\nThen we revise ˆ a yz as ˜ ξ = ˆ ξ − ∂G(ξ) ∂ξ \t ∂ 2 F (ξ) ∂ξ 2 . Further, we give the guarantee that Q(˜ ξ, ξ old ) − Q(ξ old , ξ old ) > 0 holds in all cases. When Q(˜ ξ, ξ old ) − Q(ξ old , ξ old ) < 0, we revise ˜a yz by adding ∂F (ξ)/∂ξ in order to increase Q(˜ ξ, ξ old ). We found that Q(˜ ξ, ξ old ) doesn\u2019t reduce in some experiments,\nIn this section, we compare the performance of universal strategies and optimal ones of the GCMP with side information and the original CMP for a certain synthetic data.\nWe generated the synthetic data as follows. The latent variable y is generated by the Markov model which has the parameters ( η 1|2 , η 2|1 ) = (0.05, 0.05). We deﬁne the random variables z and w as, z ∼ N (0.5 − , γ · 2 ), w ∼ N (0.5+ , γ · 2 ), where determines the form of the two Gaussians. When the state y is 1, let x 3 ∼ N(0.2, 0.01), and x = (1 − x 3 ) · z z+w , (1 − x 3 ) · w z+w , x 3 . When the state y is 2, let x 3 ∼ N(0.8, 0.01), and x = (1 − x 3 ) · w z+w , (1 − x 3 ) ·\nx , while it is determined by ˜ x for CMP. Recall that the wealth density for GCMP is given by (16). On the other hand, for CMP, we created the data ˜ x. We can expect that the performance of GCMP is better than that of CMP when is small, because the states cannot be easily distinguished based on only ˜ x. Here,\nwe let n = 1000. \u201copt\u201d and \u201cuni\u201d denote optimal strategy and universal one, respectively. Seeing the results, we can ﬁnd\nthat in the case of the data whose states cannot be easily distinguished by ˜ x, that is is small, the performance of universal strategy of GCMP with side information was better than that of CMP, while in the case that states can be easily distinguished by ˜ x, the performance of the original CMP was better. Therefore, the results agree with our expectation. Note that the wealth by the optimal CRP is less than 3 for the synthetic data used for this simulation. This is because the optimal CRP is nearly equal to (0 .5, 0.5) for the data sets, which cannot increase the wealth very much.\nThis research was partially supported by FUJIFILM Corpo- ration."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
