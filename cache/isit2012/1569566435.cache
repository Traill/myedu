It may arise, for example, in the downlink of a multiuser communication system where the base station wants to communicate with the users in the area of coverage. The multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technology offers a new opportunity for developing efﬁcient broadcast strategies.\nThe capacity of a MIMO broadcast channel has been determined in [1], where it was shown that the so-called dirty- paper coding is instrumental to achieving the capacity. Mul- tiple antennas allow to pre-cancel the interuser interference, which is known at the transmitter in the broadcast application. The lattice method represents a major approach to cancelling known interference [2], and speciﬁcally, to precoding for MIMO broadcast. However, dirty-paper coding suffers from high complexity.\nHochwald et al. [3] formulated precoding as a decoding problem at the transmitter. Their technique, termed \u201cvector perturbation\u201d, corresponds to solving the closest lattice vector problem (CVP). It requires the use of the sphere precoder [4], whose average complexity grows quickly with the system size. Earlier, the idea of precoding via an algorithmic search over modulo equivalent points was proposed by Fischer et al. for the intersymbyol interference channel [5]. More recently, reference [6] considered some practical issues in the imple- mentation of vector perturbation.\nTo reduce the complexity, lattice reduction (LR) can be used, i.e., an approximate solution is found by zero-forcing (ZF) or successive interference cancelation (SIC) on a reduced\nlattice [7, 8]. Another scheme of approximate lattice precoding was proposed in [9] (we will show that it is actually equivalent to LR-aided ZF in [8]), which was shown to achieve the full diversity order.\nIn contrast to the complexity analysis of sphere decoding [10], the complexity of sphere precoding is not available in literature. Moreover, the signal-to-noise (SNR) gap be- tween sphere precoding and LR-aided precoding has not been analyzed, although it has been done for decoding [11]. In this paper, we investigate these aspects of lattice precoding algorithms. We view the precoding problem as a variant of the CVP known as η-CVP. This view enables us to derive the proximity factors for lattice precoding, which measure the worst-case loss in power efﬁciency of LR-aided precoding schemes.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the model of MIMO broadcast using lattice precoding, and investigates its complexity. In Section III the analysis of the proximity factors is given. Section V is a discussion.\nNotation: The transpose, inverse, pseudoinverse of a matrix B by B T , B −1 , and B \u2020 , respectively, and the Euclidean length ∥u∥ = √ ⟨u, u⟩. ⌈x⌋ rounds to a closest integer.\nConsider a MIMO broadcast system including one transmit- ter, equipped with n antennas, and n receivers, each equipped with a single antenna [3]. For convenience, we use the real- valued signal model\nwhere y is the received signal vector at the users, H ∈ R n ×n is a full-rank channel matrix, s is the transmitted signal, and n is the noise vector. The entry h i,j of H indicates the channel coefﬁcient between transmit antenna i and user j. s is derived from the data vector x = [x 1 , ..., x n ] T . We assume that x ∈ [−A/2, A/2] n is taken from the intersection of a ﬁnite hypercube and an integer lattice. The entries of n are i.i.d. Gaussian with variance σ 2 each.\nAn n-dimensional lattice in the m-dimensional Euclidean space R m (n ≤ m) is the set of integer linear combinations of n independent vectors b 1 , . . . , b n ∈ R m :\nThe matrix B = [b 1 · · · b n ] is a basis of the lattice L(B). In matrix form, L(B) = {Bx : x ∈ Z n }. For any point y ∈R m and any lattice L (B), the distance of y to the lattice is dist(y, B) = min x ∈Z n ∥y − Bx∥. A shortest vector of a lattice L (B) is a non-zero vector in L (B) with the smallest Euclidean norm. The length of the shortest vector, often referred to as the minimum distance, of L (B) is denoted by λ 1 .\nA lattice has inﬁnitely many bases. In general, every matrix B = BU is also a basis, where U is an unimodular matrix, i.e., det(U) = ±1 and all elements of U are integers. The aim of lattice reduction is to ﬁnd a good basis for a given lattice. In many applications, it is advantageous to have the basis vectors as short as possible. The celebrated LLL algorithm is the ﬁrst polynomial (average) time algorithm which ﬁnds a vector not much longer than the shortest nonzero vector.\nLet ˆ b 1 ,...,ˆ b n be the Gram-Schmidt vectors corresponding to a basis b 1 ,...,b n , where ˆ b i is the projection of b i orthogonal to the vector space generated by b 1 ,...,b i −1 . These are the vectors found by the Gram-Schmidt algorithm for orthogonalization. Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) is closely related to QR decomposition B = QR. More precisely, one has the relations µ j,i = r i,j /r i,i and ˆ b i = r i,i · q i , where q i is the i th column of Q.\nfor 1 < i ≤ n, where 1/4 < δ ≤ 1 is a factor selected to achieve a good quality-complexity tradeoff.\nDeﬁnition 1 (η-CVP)): Given a lattice L (B) and a vector y ∈ R m , ﬁnd a vector Bˆ x ∈ L (B) such that ∥y − Bˆx∥ ≤ η dist(y, B).\nwhere B \t H −1 , and ˆl is an integer vector, chosen to minimize the transmission power:\nNote that s ∈ V(L(AB)) (the Voronoi region). The receivers apply the modulo function each, obtaining\ny mod A = HB(x − Aˆl) + n mod A = (x − Aˆl) + n mod A = x + n mod A.\nNamely, the data arrive at individual users free of interuser interference; the only effect is noise. To solve the CVP (5), the sphere precoding algorithm originally proposed for decoding purposes was used.\nIt is worth pointing out several distinctions between the CVP\u2019s in decoding and precoding:\n\u2022 Decoding gets easier for weaker noise, while noise has no impacts on the hardness of lattice precoding.\n\u2022 The constellation in decoding is often ﬁnite, while the lattice in precoding is inﬁnite. Thus, the boundary errors in decoding will not an issue in precoding.\n\u2022 The received signal in decoding has a Gaussian distri- bution centered at a lattice point, while the input to pre- coding is roughly uniformly distributed on a fundamental parallelepiped.\nFor these reasons, sphere precoding incurs more computa- tional complexity than sphere decoding at the same dimension n. Fincke and Pohst [12] proposed an algorithm to enumerate the lattice points in a sphere, running on an LLL-reduced lattice, but their complexity estimate was loose. Kannan\u2019s algorithm [13] for HKZ reduction can be used to preprocess the lattice, giving a CVP algorithm with n n+o(n) complexity. Hanrot and Stehl´e\u2019 improved the CVP complexity analysis to\nOn the other hand, Jald´en and Ottersten [10] showed that the average complexity of sphere decoding is exponential with the dimension for any ﬁxed SNR; the constant within the exponent, though, does decrease with SNR, meaning lower complexity at higher SNR. However, the encouraging results for lattice decoding do not extend to precoding. Noise, which is crucial to the decreasing complexity of sphere decoding, does not even arise in lattice precoding. Since the input is largely uniformly distributed in the fundamental parallelepiped, the worst-case bound is a sensible measure of complexity. Moreover, the paper [10] assumed a ﬁnite constellation, rendering the analysis inapplicable to an inﬁnite lattice, which is nonetheless the case for precoding problems.\nTo conclude, the worst-cast complexity of sphere precoding is super-exponential.\n1) SIC Precoding: To obtain a fast precoder, Windpassinger et al. [8] approximated the CVP by using lattice reduction, i.e., the closest vector is replaced with Babai\u2019s approximations [7]. Let B designate the reduced basis, i.e., B = BU, where U is a unimodular matrix. Performing the QR decomposition B = QR, where Q has orthogonal columns and R is an upper triangular matrix with nonnegative diagonal elements.\nLet u = Q \u2020 Bx/A. An estimate of ˆl is then found by the SIC procedure:\ny mod A = H(Bx − ABˆl) + n mod A = x −AUˆl+ n mod A = x + n mod A.\n2) ZF Precoding: Let u = Bx/A. An estimate of ˆl is found by ZF as follows\nThe second line of (10) represents the transmission scheme in [8], while the third line corresponds to the transmission scheme in [9]. Therefore, the schemes proposed in [8, 9] are equivalent. To the best of our knowledge, this equivalence is not known in literature. At the receivers, the modulo operation is applied, yielding the same as (9).\nTo summarize, the purpose of approximate lattice precoding is to ﬁnd a sub-optimal solution ˆl that can reduce the norm ∥s∥. Withe lattice reduction, the transmitted vector s falls into the fundamental parallelepiped (for ZF) or the rectangle spanned by the Gram-Schmidt vectors of the reduced basis AB (for SIC). In both cases, the transmission power is proportional to the second moment over the respective regions. Let V = | det B| be the fundamental volume of L(B), and P be its fundamental parallelepiped. Let ∥B∥ 2 be the Frobenius norm of B, and ˆ B be the Gram-Schmidt matrix for B. Using a uniform-distribution approximation, the transmission powers associated with the approximate lattice precoders are respectively given by\nfor SIC. Therefore, the objective of lattice reduction in this application is to minimize the Frobenious norm of B or ˆ B. However, it is computationally hard to exactly accomplish this objective. Thus, the LLL algorithm is often used.\nWe want to understand the performance of approximate lattice precoding. To do this, we compare the transmission powers with that of sphere encoding, under the condition that they have the same error performance, namely, (6) and (9) hold at the receivers. This is a standard approach to calculating the \u201ccoding gain\u201d 1 .\nwhere V denotes the Voronoi region of L(B), and σ 2 ( V) is the second moment of V. Then, the SNR gap is asymptotically given by\nUnfortunately, it is difﬁcult to compute ρ, and we resort to the proximity factors of LLL reduction-aided precoding, which measure the worst-case loss in power efﬁciency relative to sphere precoding. More formally, we deﬁne the proximity factor as\nObviously, ρ ≤ F P . This viewpoint implies that the precoding problem is η-CVP:\nand consequently, F P ≤ η 2 . Babai derived the value of η [7] in the case of δ = 3/4. In what follows, we will derive the bounds in the general case. Let α = 1/(δ − 1/4).\nLemma 1: If the lattice basis is LLL-reduced, then SIC solves η-CVP for η = η n = α n/2 /\nProof: Let B be a LLL reduced basis and B = ˆ Bµ T be the GSO of the basis B. Given a vector y ∈ R m , we write y as a linear combination of the GS vectors y =\nβ i ˆ b i . Let u =\np i ˆ b i be the nearest neighbor of y in L (B). Let θ be the integer nearest to β n and y \u2032 =\nβ i ˆ b i + θˆ b n , and v =θb n . For n = 1, SIC can ﬁnd the closest vector u. For n ≥ 2, we have\n≥ |β n − p n | ∥ˆb n ∥ ≥ |β n − θ| ∥ˆb n ∥\nLet w be the estimate of u found by SIC. From (17), we obtain\n≤ (1 + η 2 n −1 ) 1/2 ∥y − u∥ < η n ∥y − u∥ .\nCombining this inequality with (20), we obtain ∥y − w∥ ≤\nLemma 2: If the lattice basis is LLL-reduced, then ZF solves η-CVP with η = η n = 1 + 2n (3\nProof: Let B be a LLL reduced basis. Let θ i be the angle between b i and the linear space S ([b 1 ,...,b i −1 ,b i+1 ,...,b n ]) spanned by the other n − 1 basis vectors. Recall the following bound [11]\nwhere |β i | ≤ 1/2, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Let u be the nearest neighbor of y in L (B). We may write\nwhere ϕ i ∈ Z. We assume u ̸= w. Let ∥ϕ k b k ∥ = max i ∥ϕ i b i ∥. Then\n∥u − y∥ ≥ \t |ϕ k | 2 (3\nCombining (29) and (30), we have ∥u − w∥ ≤ n ∥ϕ k b k ∥\nFrom the two lemmas, we have the following theorem for the proximity factors:\nThese results show that the worst-case loss in power efﬁ- ciency of approximate lattice precoders is bounded above by a function of the dimension of the lattice alone.\nOur main contribution in this paper was to view the LR- aided precoding problem as η-CVP, compared to the viewpoint of bounded distance decoding for LR-aided decoding [11]. This viewpoint allowed us to derive the proximity factors, which measure the worst-cased bound for approximate lattice precoding. Since the underlying lattice is inﬁnite, this analysis is rigorous, and it follows that LR-aided precoding also achieves full diversity. The derived bounds may not be tight, but nonetheless give more insights. Improving the bounds is the future work.\nThe authors are grateful to the reviewers for their helpful comments.
