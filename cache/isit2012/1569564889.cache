This is the basic idea of the interference alignment (IA) technique, which was ﬁrst proposed in [1], [2] and has received a lot of attention since then.\nIn this paper, we restrict our attention to alignment schemes in signal vector space (i.e., schemes that apply linear pre- coding and decoding), and address the feasibility of linear IA for MIMO interference networks with constant channel coefﬁcients, which remains as an open problem in its full generality. The ﬁrst work to study this problem was [3], where the solvability of the IA polynomial equations was analyzed based on classic results in algebraic geometry like Bezout\u2019s and Bernstein\u2019s theorems. By counting the number of equations and variables involved in any subset of zero-forcing alignment equations, Yetis et al. introduced in [3] the deﬁnition of a proper system. Connections between proper and feasible systems were established only for the single-beam case in which each user transmits only one stream of data, whereas for the multibeam case the equivalence between proper and feasible systems does not longer hold.\nIn [4] the feasibility of IA was studied by interpreting the alignment process as a joint transmit-receive zero-forcing scheme in which each interfering stream can be suppressed at either the transmitter or the receiver sacriﬁcing one degree\nof freedom. The proposed feasibility test, however, provides only necessary conditions and is combinatorial in nature since must check all possible ways to suppress interfering streams at both sides of the link and for all users.\nMore recent work on the feasibility of IA has been presented in [5] and [6]. Speciﬁcally, [5] studies the dimensions of the algebraic varieties involved in the alignment problem (input, output and solution variety), and proves a sufﬁcient and necessary condition of feasibility for the particular case of symmetric square MIMO interference channels, where all transmitters and receivers have the same number of antennas, all users transmit the same number of streams and there are at least three interfering users (K ≥ 3). For the general case with arbitrary system parameters, only a necessary condition is proved in [5]. Similar algebraic tools are used in [6] to prove general bounds on the tuple of DoF that are achievable through linear interference alignment. Furthermore, for the particular case of symmetric systems where the number of transmit and receive antennas is divisible by the number of streams the bound is tight and can be achieved through IA.\nIn this paper we propose a polynomial-time complexity test of feasibility for the linear alignment problem. The main idea is to consider the input space (projective space of MIMO interference channels) and the solution variety (channels, pre- coders and decoders satisfying the IA polynomial equations) as smooth compact manifolds and to study the linear mapping between the tangent spaces of both smooth manifolds given by the ﬁrst projection. It the mapping is surjective, which amounts to check whether a given matrix is full-rank, the linear alignment is feasible; otherwise is infeasible. We show that the test is consistent with all known DoF outer bounds for the interference channel (e.g., [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]). Furthermore, the proposed feasibility test can be used to obtain the total DoF for any K-user MIMO interference channel simply by checking the feasibility of all possible DoF tuples.\nWe consider in this paper the K-user MIMO interference channel with transmitter j having M j ≥ 1 antennas and receiver j having N j ≥ 1 antennas. We assume without loss of generality that each user wishes to send d j ≥\n1 streams or messages 1 . We adhere to the notation used in [3] and denote this asymmetric interference channel as\nThe symmetric case in which all users transmit d streams and are equipped with M transmit and N receive antennas is denoted as (M × N, d) K . In the square symmetric case all users have the same number of antennas M = N .\nThe MIMO channel from transmitter l to receiver k is denoted as H kl and assumed to be ﬂat-fading and constant over time. Each H kl is an N k × M l complex matrix with inde- pendent entries drawn from a continuous distribution (channels generated in this way are generic). For the sake of simplicity, we will consider only the fully connected interference channel where each user receives interference from the rest of K − 1 transmitters, and where each transmitter interferes to all the K − 1 unintended receivers. However, the results in this paper can be easily extended to partially connected networks.\nUser j encodes its message using an M j × d j precoding matrix V j and the received signal is given by\nwhere x j is the d j × 1 transmitted signal and n j is the zero mean unit variance circularly symmetric additive white Gaussian noise vector. The ﬁrst term in (1) is the desired signal, while the second term represents the interference space. The receiver j applies a linear decoder U j of dimensions N j × d j , i.e.,\nThe interference alignment (IA) problem consist in ﬁnding the precoders and decoders, V j and U j , in such a way that the interfering signals at each receiver fall into a reduced- dimensional subspace and the receivers can then extract the projection of the desired signal that lies in the interference- free subspace. To this end, it is required that the polynomial equations\nare satisﬁed, while the signal subspace for each user must be linearly independent of the interference subspace and must have dimension d k , that is\nTaking (4) into account, we assume in the sequel that for any feasible IA strategy the number of streams transmitted by each user satisﬁes the point-to-point bound given by\nIn this paper we are interested in studying the follow- ing feasibility problem: For a given interference network,\n(N k × M k , d k ), to decide whether there exists a linear alignment solution for generic interference MIMO channels H kl . In that case, we say that the problem is generically feasible, or simply feasible.\nTo formally state the feasibility problem, let us consider the following diagram\nπ 1 \t π 2 H \t S\nis the input space composed by the Cartesian product of all interference MIMO channels (here, P(M N k ×M l (C) denotes the projective space of complex-valued N k × M l matrices),\nis the output space formed by the precoder and decoder Grassmannians (G a,b denotes the Grassmannian formed by the linear subspaces of complex dimension a in C b , with 0 ≤ a ≤ b); and\nis the so\u2013called solution variety. Note that we are denoting by H the collection of all matrices H kl , and, similarly, U and V denote the set of U j and V j , 1 ≤ j ≤ K, respectively. Deﬁned in this way, H, S and V are all compact and smooth manifolds [13]. Speciﬁcally, the set V is given by certain polynomial equations, linear in each of the H, U, V and therefore is an algebraic subvariety of the product space H × S.\nNote that, given H ∈ H, the set π −1 1 (H) is a copy of the set of U, V such that (3) holds, that is the solution set of the linear interference alignment problem. On the other hand, given (U, V ) ∈ S, the set π −1 2 (U, V ) is a copy of the set of H ∈ H such that (3) holds. The feasibility question studied in this paper can then be restated more formally as follows,\nThe following theorem solves the question posed in Problem 1 and, as a by product, provides a simple feasibility test.\nTheorem 1: Problem 1 is feasible iff for almost every choice of H kl , and for any choice of U k , V l satisfying (3), the linear mapping, θ, deﬁned by\nis surjective, i.e., it has maximal rank equal to k=l d k d l . Here, ˙ U 1 , . . . , ˙ U K , ˙ V 1 , . . . , ˙ V K denotes a set of matrices of dimensions N k × d k or M l × d l depending on whether ˙ U k or ˙ V l is considered, which are afﬁne representations of the components of a vector in the tangent space of V.\nA detailed proof of the claim in Theorem 1 can be found in [13]. Here, due to space limitations, we only provide a sketch of the proof along with a more descriptive explanation that help readers to develop a clear understanding of our main result. It is not difﬁcult to see that V is not only an algebraic set but also a compact complex manifold, whose dimension can be easily computed from the fact that its constituent equations are, when regarded as afﬁne equations, independent. One can also (trivially) compute the dimension of H and S. If dim V < dim H, then the projection π 1 (V) cannot cover most of H. It turns out that this is indeed the case that the problem is not proper as deﬁned in [3]. Let us center our attention in the proper case: we have dim V ≥ dim H, but it can still happen that π 1 (V) is only a zero\u2013measure set of H. The reader can have in mind a vertical line projecting into a horizontal line: both sets have the same dimension but the projection of the vertical line is just a point, thus a zero measure subset of the horizontal line. Mathematically, this is identiﬁed by the fact that for every element of V, the derivative of π 1 is not surjective, namely it does not project the tangent space of V onto the whole tangent space of H, just on a vector subspace. Now, the tangent space of V is easy to describe: it is the set of tangent vectors ( ˙ H, ˙ U , ˙ V ) such that\nBecause U k and V l are full\u2013rank, the fact that the derivative of π 1 is surjective is then equivalent to the mapping (8) being surjective (this is not a completely obvious fact, see [13] for a proof.) Thus, checking the rank of θ detects if the projection from V onto H has a surjective derivative at some chosen point. Now, standard tools from differential topology 2 and algebraic geometry prove that:\n\u2022 either θ is almost everywhere surjective, in which case the problem is feasible or\n\u2022 θ is nowhere surjective, in which case the problem is infeasible.\nThis is the main idea behind the proof of our Theorem 1. Note that choosing at random some (H, U, V ) ∈ V and checking if the associated linear mapping (8) is surjective permits to decide if the IA problem is feasible or not. If the test answers \u201cfeasible\u201d then the problem is feasible. If it answers \u201cinfeasible\u201d then, unless we were extremely unlucky and chose (H, U, V ) in a certain zero\u2013measure set, the problem is infeasible (and thus our answer is correct). In practice, one can repeat the test a few times to discard that possibility.\nAs indicated by Theorem 1, the proposed feasibility test has to perform two tasks:\n1) To choose an arbitrary set (H kl , U k , V l ) such that (3) holds: we call this the inverse IA problem.\n2) To check whether the matrix B (in any basis) deﬁning the linear mapping (8) satisﬁes det(BB ∗ ) = 0, which means that the mapping θ is surjective.\nThe inverse IA problem consists of, given arbitrary (ran- dom) realizations of U k , V l , ﬁnding a set of MIMO channels such that (3) holds. Since this problem is linear in the entries of the MIMO channels, it amounts to solving the following set of linear systems of equations\nwhere vec(H kl ) is a vectorized version of the MIMO channel matrix H kl , and A kl is an d k d l × N k M l matrix obtained as the transpose of the Kronecker product of V l and U k , that is\nFor example, for the 3-user interference channel, the inverse IA problem reduces to solving the following linear systems of equations\nThe solution of the inverse IA problem obtained in the previous stage, provide us with a generic choice of U k , V l and H kl satisfying (3). For this particular element of the solution variety, the linear mapping θ given by (8) can be written in matrix form as\nwhere w = vec([ ˙ U 1 , . . . , ˙ U K , ˙ V 1 , . . . , ˙ V K ]) and B is a block matrix with K(K − 1) row partitions (as many blocks as interfering links) and 2K column partitions (as many blocks as precoding and decoding matrices). Checking the feasibility of IA then reduces to check whether the matrix B is full rank or not. The vectorization of the mapping (8) shows that B is composed of two main kinds of blocks, B (U ) kl and B (V ) kl , i.e.\nvec( ˙ U T k H kl V l + U T k H kl ˙ V l ) = (I d l ⊗ U T k H kl )\n(13) where I n denotes the n × n identity matrix and K m,n is the mn × mn commutation matrix which is deﬁned as the matrix that transforms the vectorized form of an m × n matrix into the vectorized form of its transpose. Block B (U ) kl has dimensions d l d k × d l M l , whereas block B (V ) kl is d l d k × d k N k . For a given tuple (k, l), B (U ) kl and B (V ) kl are placed in the row partition that corresponds to the interfering link indicated by the tuple (k, l). However, B (U ) kl is placed in the l + K- th column partition, whereas B (V ) kl occupies the k-th column partition. The rest of blocks are occupied by null matrices\nOnce B has been built, the last step is to check if its rank is maximum, that is, rank(B) = k=l d k d l . A simple method consists of generating a random element b in C k=l d k d l , computing the least squares solution of Bw = b and checking if Bw − b is small enough, say smaller than or equal to 10 −8 . With high probability in the choice of b this test will determine if θ is a surjective mapping.\nNotice that B has the same structure as the incidence matrix of the network connectivity graph. Taking again the 3-user interference channel as an example, B is constructed as follows\n        \n        \nRemark 1: The above test has been presented in ﬂoating point arithmetic and is thus sensitive to ﬂoating point errors. Although it is robust enough for every example that we have tried, it is straightforward to design a version which works in exact arithmetic, as shown in [13]. Furthermore, regarding the complexity of the proposed test, it can be shown that the problem of deciding if a given system is generically infeasible is in the BPP (Bounded-error Probabilistic Polynomial time) complexity class.\nRemark 2: Some complexity analysis have recently ap- peared in the literature suggesting that to check the feasibility of IA problems is NP-hard [14]. However, there is a crucial difference between the problem considered in [14] and the one considered in this paper. Informally stated, the key difference is that [14] studies the alignment problem for a particular real- ization of the interference channels, H kl , whereas we consider the feasibility of IA for generic channels (e.g., channels with i.i.d. entries drawn from any continuous distribution). Notice also that even if the generic feasibility problem can be solved in polynomial time, ﬁnding the actual precoders and decoders that align the interference subspaces for a particular channel realization can still be NP-hard, as proved in [14], [15].\nRemark 3: If the problem is feasible for a given stream distribution, (d 1 , . . . , d K ), this DoF tuple is achievable by linear IA. Therefore, by solving the feasibility problem it would be possible to obtain the maximum total DoF for any interference channel simply by exhaustive search over all possible DoF tuples that satisfy the existing outer bounds.\nA. Congruence with existing feasibility results and DoF bounds\nThe feasibility problem is ﬁrst considered in [3], where a system is classiﬁed as proper if and only if the number of\nindependent variables in every set of equations in (3) is at least as large as the number of equations in that set. This result assumes the polynomial equations involved in the problem are generic. However, for multibeam scenarios this assumption does not hold, and a correspondence between proper and feasible systems cannot be established. Conversely, improper systems are infeasible, as proved in [5] and [6]. Our test is congruent with these results since improperness implies\nAdditionally, for the K-user symmetric channel, denoted as (M × N, d) K , proper systems are feasible if M = N [5] or both M and N are divisible by d [6]. Recent results in [9], [10] and [11] give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the feasibility of the 3-user symmetric scenario, (M × N, d) 3 . For all these particular settings, the proposed test is in agreement with known results.\nIn those scenarios where none of the previous feasibility results apply, we have to rely on DoF outer bounds for establishing the infeasibility of a proper system. For instance, it is well known that for a point-to-point MIMO channel, (M k × N k , d k ), (5) has to be veriﬁed. In addition, for any 2-user pair in the network, (M k × N k , d k )(M l × N l , d l ), the following outer bound must be satisﬁed [7],\n(14) For the symmetric K-user interference channel (with uneven\nstream distribution among the users), K k=1 (M × N, d k ), the following outer bound, proved in [8], can be applied\n(15) where R = max(M,N ) min(M,N ) and I (·) represents the indicator function.\nThe proposed test is also consistent with all these outer bounds. In fact, the test is proven to answer infeasible when (5) is not satisﬁed, cf. [13]. Proving that the violation of other, more complicated, bounds like (14) and (15) also results in matrix B being rank-deﬁcient will be considered in a future work.\nNow, let us discuss the results provided by our feasibility test in some representative examples 3 .\nExample 1: First, consider the symmetric (5 × 11, 4) 3 in- terference network, which is classiﬁed as proper according to [3]. According to [9] and [11] this scenario is infeasible which is also in agreement with our test. Thus, the maximum total number of DoF for this network cannot be larger than 11 as implied also by the outer bound in (15). By shutting off one beam of the ﬁrst user, the system (5 × 11, 3)(5 × 11, 4) 2 could, in principle, be feasible because it satisﬁes the mentioned outer\nbound. Our test shows that this system is actually feasible and, thus, the outer bound (15) is tight for this particular scenario.\nExample 2: Now, consider the 3-user system 3 j=1 (7 × 13, d j ) where the stream distribution among users is not speciﬁed. The results in [9], [11] show that the system is infeasible if 5 streams per user are transmitted. Our test indicates that the (7 × 13, 5) 3 system is infeasible whereas the system (7 × 13, 4)(7 × 13, 5) 2 is feasible, which allows us to claim that the maximum total DoF for this network is 14.\nExample 3: Consider the scenarios (15 × 5, 4) 4 and (24 × 6, 5) 5 which are the simplest non-trivial scenarios for 4 and 5 users, respectively, that are proper but infeasible. Both scenarios violate the outer bound (15) which establishes that the total DoF cannot exceed 15 and 24, respectively. In fact, the proposed test shows that (15 × 5, 3)(15 × 5, 4) 3 and (24 × 6, 4)(24 × 6, 5) 4 are feasible systems and, then, (15) is tight for these particular scenarios.\nExample 4: The (4×4, 2)(5×3, 2)(6×2, 2) network, which was studied in [4], satisﬁes the 2-user outer bound (14) for all 2-user pairs in the network. No other existing results apply to asymmetric systems like this one. However, the test proposed in this paper answers infeasible.\nExample 5: A ﬁnal interesting example is the (2×2, 1)(5× 5, 2) 2 (8 × 8, 4) system, which is feasible according to the proposed test. This system has been built by taking the symmetric (5 × 5, 2) 4 system, which is known to be feasible, and transferring 6 antennas from the ﬁrst to the fourth user. It must be noticed that while the total amount of antennas for both systems remains constant, the redistribution of antennas has allowed to achieve one DoF more in the asymmetric network. This example gives new evidence for the conjecture settled in [4], which asserts that for a given total number of DoF, d tot = k d k , there exist feasible asymmetric MIMO interference systems (that is, with unequal antenna and stream distribution among the links) such that the total number of antennas, k (M k + N k ), is less than number of antennas of the smallest symmetric system (M k = M , N k = N , and d k = d tot /K) that can achieve d tot .\nLet us ﬁnally point out that, in all cases in which our feasibility test was positive, we were able to ﬁnd an IA using the iterative interference leakage minimization algorithm proposed in [16] 4 .\nThis paper gives a test to check the feasibility of linear interference alignment in arbitrary K-user MIMO interference channels. The test is a direct consequence of a powerful result which states that the linear alignment problem is generically feasible iff the algebraic dimension of the solution variety is larger than or equal to the dimension of the input space and the linear mapping between the tangent spaces of both smooth manifolds given by the ﬁrst projection is surjective. In practice, our test reduces to check whether a given matrix\nis full rank or not. The test neither requires any assumption (apart from the genericity of the MIMO channels), nor re- lies on any information-theoretic bound for the interference channel. However, it always provides answers which are in agreement with all the existing outer bounds and the most recent feasibility results.\nThe work of O. Gonz´alez and I.
