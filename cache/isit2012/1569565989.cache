We develop a cross-layer solution, based on hybrid ARQ transmission with incremental redundancy. We provide a scheme that combines power control, ﬂow control, and scheduling in order to maximize a global utility function, subject to the stability of the data queues, an average power constraint, and a constraint on the privacy outage probability. Our scheme is based on the assumption that each node has an estimate of its uplink channel gain at each block, while only the distribution of the cross channel gains is available. We prove that our scheme achieves a utility, arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable utility given the available channel state information."},"body":{"text":"privacy constraints. We prove the optimality of our scheme by Lyapunov optimization theory. Finally, we numerically charac- terize the performance of the dynamic control algorithm with respect to several network parameters.\nThe HARQ transmission scheme we use is similar to the one employed in [10], which considers a block fading wire- tap channel with a single source-destination pair and an (ex- ternal) eavesdropper and develops sequences of Wyner codes to be transmitted in subsequent transmissions of a block of information. The main challenge of incorporating information encoding across many blocks into our solution was that, it is not possible to dynamically update the resource allocation, based on the amount of information leakage to the other nodes at each retransmission, since the amount of leakage is unknown to the transmitting node. Furthermore, the privacy outage probability of subsequent retransmissions of a given block cannot be decoupled from each other, eliminating the possibility of using standard Lyapunov techniques. We resolve that issue by utilizing the Markov inequality so that the desired decoupling occurs at the expense of some loss in performance. We believe our new technique contributes to the ﬁeld of network control [7], [8], since it enables the use of Lyapunov techniques in the analysis of the schemes such as HARQ, which is based on encoding information over many blocks.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the system model and provides a brief summary of INR HARQ. Section III gives the problem formulation. In Sec- tion IV, we give our joint ﬂow and scheduling algorithm. Lastly, Section V contains the numerical results of the effect of system parameters on the performance of the algorithm. Section VI concludes this work by summarizing the contributions.\nNetwork Model: We consider a multiuser uplink network as illustrated in Fig. 1. The system consists of multiple nodes and a base station. The trafﬁc injected by each of these nodes, consists of both open and private packets. Nodes wish to transmit those packets to the base station via the uplink channel, which we will refer to as the main channel. All private messages of each node need to be transmitted to the base station, privately from the other nodes. They overhear transmissions from the transmitting node over the cross channels. Hence, nodes will treat each other as \u201cinternal eavesdroppers\u201d when transmitting private information.\nWe assume the time to be slotted. Over each block (of time), the amount of open information, A o j (k), and private information,\neach retransmission, base station combines the codeword of length N with the previously transmitted codewords of the same packet. For a packet with content W j , let the vector of symbols received by node i = j be Y i = [Y N i ,1 , ...,Y N i ,m ] at the end of m th retransmission of the packet by node j. To achieve perfect privacy, the following constraint must satisﬁed by node j, for all i = j.\nNote that the amount, ˆ R p j , of encoded private information and the amount, ˆ R j of bits that encapsulate the private information is ﬁxed and do not change from one packet to another. For INR, the mutual information accumulation for the l th private packet in the main channel and eavesdropper channels over block n can be found (as detailed in [10]) as:\nrespectively, where n l −1 j is the block index at which the (l − 1) st private packet is successfully decoded by the base station. Note that, if ˆ R j < D l j (n) at block n, we say that the successful decoding of the private packet took place.\nIf the accumulated information at one of eavesdroppers ex- ceeds ˆ R j − ˆ R p j , perfect privacy constraint (4) is violated and we say that the privacy outage occurs. Then, the privacy outage probability over block n for the l th private packet is calculated as:\nFor the case of open transmission, at the transmitter, the information and CRC bits are encoded by a mother code [9]. In each transmission, only the systematic part of the codeword and a selected number of parity bits are transmitted. Decoding is attempted at the receiver side by combining all previously transmitted codes. This procedure is again called INR HARQ, and mutual information accumulated for the l th private packet in the main channel of user j over block n is\nwhere n l o −1 j corresponds to the block index, where the (l − 1) st open message is successfully decoded by the base station. Here, we assume that ﬁxed length packets are encoded with a rate of\nˆ R o j , and arrive to the open queue at node j. If the accumulated information is larger than the ﬁxed rate, i.e., ˆ R o j < D l ,o j (n), the decoding of the open message is successful.\nIn this section, we formulate the problem as a network utility maximization (NUM) problem. Our objective is to choose the admission rate and transmission power in order to achieve a long term private and open rates close to the optimal, while keeping the rate of privacy outages below a certain level.\nLet U p j (x) and U o j (x) be the utilities obtained by node j from the transmission of x private and open bits respectively. We as- sume that U p j (·) and U o j (·) are non-decreasing concave functions\nshould be greater than 1 − γ j . Also note that since objective function is an increasing function of x p ,e j (15) is satisﬁed with equality at the optimal point.\nIn this section, we present an opportunistic scheduling algo- rithm maximizing the total expected utility of network while satisfying the constraints (14)-(17). In the following, we assume that there is an inﬁnite backlog of data at the transport layer of each node providing both private and open messages. The private messages are encoded by Wyner code at a ﬁxed rate ( ˆ R j , ˆ R p j ).\nHowever, the challenge here is that the privacy outage proba- bility in (7) depends on the past transmissions and the scheduling decision may affect future transmissions, i.e., the events that successful decoding occurs by an eavesdropper over subsequent retransmissions are non-iid. Then, utilizing standard Lyapunov optimization techniques [12] to solve our problem is not possible. To address this issue, we need to quantify the privacy outage probability over each block independently. For that purpose, we make use of Markov\u2019s inequality:\nwhere (18) follows from Markov inequality, and (19) is due to the fact that max i = j E D l ji (n) < ∑ i = j E D l ji (n) , since D l ji (n) is a positive random variable. Recall that D l ji (n) is the accumulated information at the eavesdropper i. According to the Markov inequality, the fraction of private packets that suffer a privacy outage is thus upper bounded by 1 ˆ R\n∑ i = j E [R ji (k)] for any block k. Hence, Markov inequality enables us to quantify the amount of information leakage to the other nodes independently over each block k, being ˆ R\n∑ i = j E [R ji (k)]. However, since the Markov inequality is merely a bound, the constraint set over which we solve the problem shrinks. Hence some performance is sacriﬁced. In the simulations, we numerically analyze the amount of shrinkage in the constraint set due to the use of the Markov inequality and show that it is not signiﬁcant under most scenarios.\nThe dynamics of private and open trafﬁc queues, Q p j (k) and Q o j (k) respectively, are given as follows:\nAs shown in [12], each of the constraints (15)-(17) can be represented by a virtual queue, and when these virtual queues are stabilized the constraints are also satisﬁed.\nwhere virtual queues in (22-24) represent the constraints in (15-17) respectively. In addition, R p ,e j (k) denotes the private information sent to the base station without privacy outage over\nThe following lemma provides an upper bound on ∆(k). Lemma 1:\nbounded. Assume that the arrival rates are also bounded by A p ,max j , A p ,e,max j \t , A o ,max j . By simple algebraic manipulation one can obtain a bound for the difference (Q p j (k + 1)) 2 − (Q p j (k)) 2 and also for other queues to obtain the result (26).\nWe now present our main result showing that our proposed dynamic control algorithm can achieve a performance arbitrarily close to the solution of the problem with the outage constraint tightened via Markov\u2019s inequality.\nTheorem 1: If R p j (k) < ∞ and R o j (k) < ∞ for all j, k, then dynamic control algorithm satisﬁes:\n1 N\n1 N\n1 N\nwhere B , ε 1 , ε 2 > 0 are constants, U ∗ is the optimal aggregate utility and ¯ U is the maximum possible aggregate utility.\nIn our numerical experiments, we consider a network consist- ing of four nodes and a single base station. The main channel between the node and the base station, and the cross-channels between nodes are modeled as iid Rayleigh fading Gaussian channels. The power gains of the main and cross-channels are exponentially distributed with means uniformly chosen in the intervals [25,50], [0.5,1.5], respectively. The main channel power gain is estimated by an unbiased estimator based on the a priori channel measurements. As discussed in [11], the estimation error of such an estimator, e j (k) can be modeled with a zero mean ﬁnite variance Gaussian random variable, i.e., e ji (k) ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) for all k. We take σ = 1. In addition, we assume only the knowledge of distribution for the cross-channel gains.\nWe consider logarithmic private and open utility functions where the private utility is κ times more than open utility at the same rate. More speciﬁcally, for a scheduled node j, U p j (k) = κ · log(1 + R p j (k)), and U o j (k) = log(1 + R o j (k)). We take κ = 5 in all experiments. We perform the simulation over ﬁve realizations of ˆ R j , ˆ R o j and ˆ R p j . ˆ R j and ˆ R o j are uniformly chosen in the interval [15, 25] and ˆ R p j in the interval [5, 10]. The rates depicted in the graphs are per node arrival and service rates averaged over all realizations of ˆ R j and ˆ R p j , i.e., the unit of the plotted rates are bits/channel use/node. All nodes have the same privacy outage probability γ . Recall that the private packets suffering privacy outage gains a utility of open packets. Thus, in all ﬁgures, these packets are considered as open services.\nIn Fig. 2(a), we investigate the effect of the tolerable privacy outage probability. It is interesting to note that private service rate increases with increasing tolerable outage probability, γ . This is due to the fact that for low γ values, the privacy outage condition is very tight, and this condition is satisﬁed by transmitting infrequently only when the channel is at its best condition and with low transmit power. The highest private service rate is realized when γ = 0.3, which suggests that 30% of the private packets undergo privacy outage. In Fig. 2(b), the effect of average power constraint, α is investigated. As expected, for a tight\nLyapunov Optimization Theorem suggests that a good control strategy is the one that minimizes the following:\nwhere U p j (k) and U o j (k) are private and open utility obtained in block k.\nBy using (26), we may obtain an upper bound for (27), as follows:\nThus, by rearranging the terms in (28) it is easy to observe that our proposed dynamic network control algorithm minimizes the right hand side of (28) with the available channel information.\nAssume that there exists a stationary scheduling and rate control policy that chooses the users and their transmission powers independent of queue backlogs and only with respect to the channel statistics. Let U ∗ be optimal value of the objective function of the problem (13) by the stationary policy. Also let x p ,e∗ j , x p ∗ j and x o ∗ j be optimal effective private, private and open trafﬁc arrivals. In addition, let P ∗ j be optimal transmission power for user j. Note that, the expectations of right hand side (RHS) of (28) can be written separately due to independence of backlogs with scheduling and rate control policy. Since the rates and transmission power are strictly interior of the feasible region, the stationary policy should satisfy the following:\nRecall that our proposed policy minimizes RHS of (28), hence, any other stationary policy has a higher RHS value. By using optimal stationary policy, we can obtain an upper bound for the RHS of our proposed policy. Inserting (29) into (28) and using the independence of queue backlogs with scheduling and rate policy, we obtain the following bound:\nNow, we can obtain bounds on performance of the proposed policy
