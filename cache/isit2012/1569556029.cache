Therefore, energy harvesting has become an appealing solution to prolong the lifetime of wireless networks. In addition to other commonly used energy sources such as solar and wind, ambient radio signals can be a viable new source for energy harvesting, which has recently drawn a great deal of interest (see, e.g., [1]-[3] and references therein). Most existing works have studied the fundamental performance limits of wireless systems with simultaneous information and energy transfer under different setups, where the receiver is assumed to be able to decode the information and harvest the energy independently from the same received signal. However, this as- sumption relies on that the received signal used for harvesting energy can be reused for decoding information, which may not be realizable due to practical circuit limitations. Consequently, in [3] the authors proposed two practical receiver designs, namely \u201ctime switching\u201d (the receiver switches between de- coding information and harvesting energy dynamically) and\n\u201cpower splitting\u201d (the receiver splits the received signal for decoding information and harvesting energy separately) to en- able wireless information transfer with simultaneous wireless energy harvesting (WEH).\nIn this paper, we investigate further the time-switching scheme in [3] for a point-to-point single-antenna ﬂat-fading channel subject to the time-varying co-channel interference, as shown in Fig. 1. It is assumed that the transmitter has a ﬁxed power supply (e.g., battery), whereas the receiver has no ﬁxed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via WEH from the received interference and/or signal sent by the transmitter. We consider an opportunistic WEH at the single-antenna receiver, i.e., the receiver can only decode information or harvest energy at any given time, but not both. As a result, the receiver needs to decide when to switch between an information decoding (ID) mode and an energy harvesting (EH) mode, based on the instantaneous channel gain and interference power, which are assumed to be perfectly known at the receiver. In this paper, we derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various tradeoffs between the minimum transmission outage probability for ID and the maximum average harvested energy for EH, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called \u201coutage-energy (O-E)\u201d region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we examine the optimal design of transmit power control and scheduling for information and energy transfer jointly with the receiver\u2019s mode switching, to achieve all the boundary outage-energy pairs of the O-E region. It is worth noting that from a tra- ditional point of view, interference in general jeopardizes the wireless channel capacity unless it is sufﬁciently strong to be decoded [4]. However, in our system of interest, interference is utilized as a source for WEH. Hence, the fundamental role of interference in emerging wireless networks with simultaneous information and power transfer still remains unknown and is thus worth further investigating.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, this paper considers a wireless point-to- point link consisting of one pair of single-antenna transmitter\n(Tx) and receiver (Rx) over a ﬂat-fading channel. It is assumed that there is an aggregate interference at Rx, which is within the same bandwidth as the transmitted signal from Tx, and changes over time. For convenience, we assume that the channel from Tx to Rx follows a block-fading model [5] and the coherence time for the time-varying interference is the same as the channel coherence time. The channel power gain and the interference power at Rx at one particular fading state are denoted by h(ν) and I(ν), respectively, where ν denotes the joint fading state. It is assumed that h(ν) and I(ν) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables (RVs) each having a continuous probability density function (PDF). At any fading state ν, h(ν) and I(ν) are assumed to be perfectly known at Rx. In addition, the additive noise at Rx is assumed to be a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) RV with zero mean and variance σ 2 .\nWe consider a block-based transmission at Tx and the time- switching scheme at Rx for decoding information or harvesting energy at each fading state. Next, we elaborate the encoding and decoding strategies for our system of interest in the following two cases: Case I: h(ν) and I(ν) are unknown at Tx for all the fading states of ν, referred to as CSI Unknown at Tx; and Case II: h(ν) and I(ν) are perfectly known at Tx at each fading state ν, referred to as CSI Known at Tx (CSIT).\nFirst, consider the case of CSI Unknown at Tx, as shown in Fig. 2(a). In this case, Tx transmits information continuously with constant power P for all the fading states due to the lack of CSI. At each fading state ν, Rx decides whether to decode the information or harvest the energy from the received signal based on h(ν) and I(ν). For example, as shown in Fig. 2(a), time slots 1 and 3 are allocated to EH mode at Rx, while time slot 2 is allocated to ID mode. For convenience, we deﬁne an indicator function to denote the receiver\u2019s mode switching at any given ν as follows:\n0, EH mode is active. \t (1) Next, we consider the case of CSI Known at Tx, i.e., the\nTx for each fading state ν. In this case, Tx is able to schedule transmission for information and energy transfer to Rx based on the instantaneous CSI. As shown in Fig. 2(b), Tx allocates time slot 1 for energy transfer, time slot 3 for information transfer, and transmits no signals in time slot 2. Accordingly, Rx will be in EH mode (i.e., π(ν) = 0) to harvest the energy from the received signal (including the interference) in time slot 1, and solely from the received interference in time slot 2, and in ID mode (i.e., π(ν) = 1) to decode the information in time slot 3. In addition to transmission scheduling, Tx can implement power control based on the CSI to further improve the information/energy transmission efﬁciency. Let p(ν) denote the transmit power of Tx at fading state ν. In this paper, we consider two types of power constraints on p(ν), namely average power constraint (APC) and peak power constraint (PPC) [5]. The APC limits the average transmit power of Tx over all the fading states, i.e., E ν [p(ν)] ≤ P avg , where E ν [ ·] denotes the expectation over ν. In contrast, the PPC constrains the instantaneous transmit power of Tx at each of the fading states, i.e., p(ν) ≤ P peak , ∀ν. Without loss of generality, we assume P avg ≤ P peak . For convenience, we deﬁne the set of feasible power allocation as\nWe consider two performance measures at Rx, which are the outage probability for wireless information transfer and the average harvested energy for WEH. Assuming that the interference is treated as additive Gaussian noise at Rx and the transmitted signal is Gaussian distributed, the instantaneous mutual information (IMI) for the Tx-Rx link at fading state ν is expressed as [5]\nNote that r(ν) = 0 if Rx switches to EH mode (i.e., π(ν) = 0). Thus, considering a delay-limited transmission with constant rate r 0 , the outage probability at Rx can be expressed as [5]\nOn the other hand, the amount of energy (normalized to the transmission block duration) that can be harvested at Rx at fading state ν is assumed to be\nwhere α is a constant that accounts for the loss in the energy transducer for converting the harvested energy to electrical energy to be stored; for convenience, it is assumed that α = 1 in this paper. Moreover, since the background thermal noise has constant power σ 2 for all the fading states, we may ignore it in (5). Thus, in the rest of this paper, we assume Q(ν) := (\nIt is easy to see that there exist non-trivial tradeoffs in assigning the receiver mode π(ν) and/or transmit power p(ν) (in the case of CSI known at Tx) to balance between minimizing the outage probability for information transfer and maximizing the average harvested energy for WEH. To characterize such tradeoffs, we introduce a so-called Outage- Energy (O-E) region (deﬁned below) that consists of all the achievable non-outage probability (deﬁned as δ = 1 − ε with outage probability ε given in (4)) and average harvested energy pairs for a given set of power constraints. In the case without (w/o) CSIT, the corresponding O-E region is deﬁned as\nOn the other hand, in the case with CSIT, the O-E region is deﬁned as\nFig. 3 shows an example of the O-E region without or with CSIT (see Sections IV and V for the details of computing the O-E regions). It is assumed that P avg = 5, P peak = 20, σ 2 = 0.5, r 0 = 0.3, h(ν) and I(ν) are independent exponen- tially distributed RVs with mean 1 and 3, respectively. It is observed that CSIT helps improving the achievable outage- energy tradeoffs. In Fig. 3, there are two boundary points shown for each O-E region denoted by (δ max , Q min ) and (0, Q max ), respectively. For example, in the case without CSIT, Q min and δ max are obtained as\nwhere f ν (h, I) denotes the joint PDF. Note that Q min is the minimum average harvested energy at Rx when the maximum non-outage probability (or minimum outage probability) is achieved. Moreover, Q max is obtained as\nwhen π(ν) = 0, ∀ν, i.e., EH mode is active all the time at Rx and thus the resulted non-outage probability is 0 (corresponding to the maximum outage probability equal to 1). Similarly, Q min , δ max , and Q max can be deﬁned for the case with CSIT; due to the space limitation, we omit their expressions.\nSince the optimal tradeoffs between the non-outage proba- bility and average harvested energy are characterized by the boundary of the O-E region, it is important to characterize all the boundary (δ, Q avg ) pairs in each case of with or without CSIT. From Fig. 3, it is easy to observe that if Q avg < Q min , the non-outage probability δ max can still be achieved for both cases. Thus, the remaining boundary of the O-E region yet to be characterized is over the intervals Q min ≤ Q avg ≤ Q max and 0 ≤ δ ≤ δ max .\nFor the convenience of analysis, we introduce the following indicator function for the event of non-outage transmission at fading state ν:\n0, otherwise. \t (12) It thus follows that the non-outage probability δ can be reformulated as\nNext, we consider the following two optimization problems. (P1) : Maximize {π(ν)} \t E ν [X(ν)]\nSubject to E ν [Q(ν)] ≥ ¯ Q p(ν) ∈ P, ∀ν\nwhere ¯ Q is the target average harvested energy. By solving Problems (P1) and (P2) for all Q min ≤ ¯ Q ≤ Q max , we are able to characterize the entire boundary of the O-E region deﬁned in (7) or (8) (without or with CSIT).\nProblems (P1) and (P2) are both non-convex optimization problems. However, it can be veriﬁed that both of them satisfy the \u201ctime-sharing\u201d condition given in [6]. To show this for Problem (P1), let Φ( ¯ Q) denote the optimal problem value given the harvested energy constraint ¯ Q, and {π a (ν) } and {π b (ν) } denote the optimal solutions given the harvested energy constraints ¯ Q a and ¯ Q b , respectively. We need to prove that for any 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1, there always exists at least one solution {π c (ν) } such that E ν [X c (ν)] ≥ θΦ( ¯ Q a ) + (1 − θ)Φ( ¯ Q b )\nin (12). Due to the space limitation, the above proof is omitted here. In fact, the \u201ctime-sharing\u201d condition implies that Φ( ¯ Q) is concave in ¯ Q, which then guarantees the zero duality gap for Problem (P1) according to the convex analysis in [7]. Similarly, we can show that the duality gap of Problem (P2) is zero. Thereby, in the following two sections, we will utilize the Lagrange duality method to solve Problems (P1) and (P2), respectively.\nWe ﬁrst study Problem (P1) for the CSIT-unknown case to derive the optimal rule at Rx to switch between EH and ID modes. The Lagrangian of Problem (P1) is formulated as\nwhere λ is the dual variable associated with the harvested energy constraint ¯ Q. Then, the Lagrange dual function of Problem (P1) is expressed as\nThe maximization problem (15) can be decoupled into parallel subproblems all having the same structure and each for one fading state. For a particular fading state ν, the associated subproblem is expressed as\nwhere L ν (π) = X +λQ. Note that we have dropped the index ν for the fading state for brevity.\nTo solve Problem (16), we need to compare the values of L ν (π) for π = 1 and π = 0. When π = 1, it follows that\nWith a given λ, Problem (15) can be efﬁciently solved by solving Problem (16) for different fading states. Problem (P1) is then solved by iteratively solving Problem (15) with ﬁxed λ, and updating λ via a simple bisection method until the harvested energy constraint is met with equality [8].\nNext, we examine the optimal solution π ∗ to Problem (P1) to gain more insights to the optimal receiver mode switching in the case without CSIT. With a given harvested energy con- straint ¯ Q, we deﬁne the region on the (h, I) plane consisting of all the point (h, I)\u2019s for which the optimal solution to Problem (P1) is π ∗ = 1 (versus π ∗ = 0) as the optimal ID region (versus the optimal EH region). Furthermore, let λ ∗ denote\nthe optimal dual solution to Problem (P1) corresponding to the given ¯ Q. Then, from (19) the optimal ID region for Problem (P1) is expressed as\nThe rest of the non-negative (h, I) plane is thus the optimal EH region, i.e.,\nwhere R 2 + denotes the two-dimensional nonnegative real do- main, and A \\B denotes the set {x|x ∈ A and x ̸∈ B}.\nAn illustration of D ID (λ ∗ ) and D EH (λ ∗ ) is shown in Fig. 4 with ¯ Q > Q min . It is noted that to meet the harvested energy constraint ¯ Q, we need to sacriﬁce (increase) the outage prob- ability for information transfer by allocating some non-outage fading states in the region H = {(h, I) : log\n} to EH mode. The problem of interest is to decide which portion of H should be allocated to EH mode. It is observed from Fig. 4 that the optimal solution to this problem is to allocate all the (h, I) pairs satisfying 1 < λ ∗ hP + λ ∗ I or hP + I > 1 λ ∗ in H to EH mode, i.e., fading states with sufﬁciently large signal plus interference total power at Rx should be allocated to EH mode. Furthermore, note that λ ∗ increases with the increasing of ¯ Q. Thus, one boundary line λ ∗ hP + λ ∗ I = 1 that separates the optimal ID and EH regions in Fig. 4 is shifted down as λ ∗ increases, and as a result D ID (λ ∗ ) shrinks. It can be shown that if λ ∗ ≥ \t 1 (e r0 −1)σ 2 , then D ID (λ ∗ ) = Ø, which corresponds to the point (0, Q max ) in Fig. 3.\nIn this section, we address the case of CSI known at Tx by jointly optimizing energy/information scheduling and power control at Tx, as well as EH/ID mode switching at Rx, as formulated in Problem (P2). For Problem (P2), let λ and β denote the dual variables corresponding to the average harvested energy constraint and average power constraint, respectively. Similarly as for Problem (P1), Problem (P2) can be decoupled into parallel subproblems each for one particular fading state and expressed as (by ignoring the fading index ν)\nwhere L ν (p, π) = X + λQ − βp. To solve Problem (22), we need to compare the optimal values of L ν (p, π) for π = 1 and π = 0, respectively, as shown next.\nwhere ¯ p = (e r0 −1)(I+σ 2 ) h \t . It can be veriﬁed that the optimal power allocation for the ID mode is the well-known \u201ctruncated channel inversion\u201d policy [5] given by\n}. When π = 0, it follows that\nDeﬁne h 2 = β λ . Then the optimal power allocation for the EH mode can be expressed as\n0, \t otherwise. \t (26) To summarize, we have\n(28) Then, given a pair of λ and β, the optimal solution to\np EH , if π ∗ = 0. \t (30) Next, to ﬁnd the optimal dual variables λ ∗ and β ∗ for Problem (P2), sub-gradient based methods such as the ellipsoid method [8] can be applied. It can be shown that the sub-gradient for updating (λ, β) is [E ν [Q ∗ (ν)] − ¯ Q, P avg − E ν [p ∗ (ν)]], where Q ∗ (ν) and p ∗ (ν) denote the harvested energy and transmit power at fading state ν after solving Problem (22) for a given pair of λ and β. Hence, Problem (P2) is solved.\nIn general, there are three possible transmission modes at Tx for the case with CSIT (cf. Fig. 2(b)): \u201cinformation transfer mode\u201d with channel inversion power control, \u201cenergy transfer mode\u201d with peak transmit power, \u201csilent mode\u201d with no transmissions, while the ﬁrst transmission mode corresponds to the ID mode at Rx and the remaining two transmission modes correspond to the EH mode at Rx. Similarly as in Section IV, given a pair of optimal dual solutions to Problem (P2) λ ∗ and β ∗ associated with a pair of ¯ Q and P avg , we can deﬁne B ID on (λ ∗ , β ∗ ), B EH on (λ ∗ , β ∗ ), and B EH oﬀ (λ ∗ , β ∗ ) on the non- negative (h, I) plane as the regions corresponding to the above three transmission modes, respectively. Since the explicit ex- pressions for characterizing the above regions are lengthy and\nalso depend on different (λ ∗ , β ∗ ) pairs, we omit their details due to the space limitation. Deﬁne G 1 (h, I) = 1 − β ∗ ¯ p − λ ∗ I, and G 2 (h, I) = 1 − β ∗ ¯ p − (λ ∗ hP peak + λ ∗ I − β ∗ P peak ). Fig. 5 shows all the four possible cases of region partitioning for B ID on (λ ∗ , β ∗ ), B EH on (λ ∗ , β ∗ ), and B EH oﬀ (λ ∗ , β ∗ ). As compared to Fig. 4 for the case without CSIT, it is observed from Fig. 5 that in the case with CSIT, the transmitter is able to jointly design information/energy scheduling and power control to optimally match the receiver ID/EH mode switching. The time-varying channel and interference are thus better exploited than the CSIT-unknown case, but at a cost of higher implementation complexity.\nThis paper studies an emerging interesting application in wireless communication where the receiver opportunistically harvests the energy from the received signals in addition to decoding their carried information. Under a point-to-point ﬂat-fading channel setup with the time-varying interference, we derive the optimal ID/EH mode switching at the re- ceiver to optimize the information-outage-probability versus average-harvested-energy tradeoffs. When the CSI is known at the transmitter, joint optimization of transmitter informa- tion/energy scheduling and power control with receiver ID/EH mode switching is investigated."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"L.
