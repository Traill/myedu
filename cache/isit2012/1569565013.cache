Finally, we also provide a framework for studying the behavior of BICM GMI in the high SNR regime, more speciﬁcally, in the saturation region.\nWe consider transmission of information with a block code of length N and rate R. At the transmitter, a message m is mapped into a codeword x (m) = (x 1 (m), . . . , x N (m)), where x k (m) ∈ X , and X is the channel input alphabet. Let M\n|X | and m log 2 (M ) denotes the cardinality of X and the number of bits per symbol, respectively.\nThe output y = (y 1 , . . . , y N ) is a random transformation of the input with transition probability distribution P Y |X (y|x). We assume memoryless channels, therefore\nwhere P Y |X (y|x) is the channel transition probability, and X, Y denote the underlying random variables taking values on the input and output alphabet X , Y.\nThe decoder decides on the estimate of the message m ac- cording to a decoding metric q (x, y). We assume a maximum metric decoder given by\nWhen the metric q (x, y) is a strictly increasing bijective function of P Y |X (y|x), the decoder will always select the maximum a posteriori (MAP) codeword. Otherwise, we have a mismatched decoder [5], [6].\nThe random coding ensemble corresponding to CM has channel inputs selected i.i.d. from X according to a proba- bility distribution P X (x). The CM decoder employs the MAP metric. The largest information rate that can be achieved with CM under the constraint x ∈ X is\nSince Eq. (8) gives an achievable rate for the distribution P bicm X , one can ﬁnd the input bit distribution with largest GMI, resulting in probabilistic shaping, by solving\nNote that maximization over P bicm X (x) is equivalent to maxi- mization over P B 1 (b), . . . , P B m (b).\nDue to the non-convex, non-concave nature of the BICM GMI, there is no simple algorithmic way to ﬁnd the suboptimal values of s and P bicm X . For discrete memoryless channels, we derived a Blahut-Arimoto type of algorithm that ﬁnds the optimal P bicm X (x) for ﬁxed s and guarantees local optimality [9]. As I bicm (s, P bicm X ) is a concave function of s, one can also optimize over s without resorting to exhaustive search.\nIn this section, we focus on BICM for the AWGN channel, and study both low- and high-SNR regimes.\nWe consider transmission over the complex ( X ⊂ C, Y = C) AWGN channel for which\nwhere z k are realizations of an i.i.d. circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance, and snr is the average SNR. Codewords are subject to a power constraint 1 N N k =1 |x k | 2 = 1. In the presence of a power constraint, the largest achievable rate with i.i.d. codebooks is now\nA scheme is said to be ﬁrst- and second-order optimal if c 1 = 1 and c 2 = − 1 2 [10].\nThe low-snr performance of BICM was studied in [11], where expressions of c 1 and c 2 were given for general mapping rules and equiprobable signaling with the classical BICM decoder (5). The result was exploited in [7] to show that BICM with Gray labeling and shaping is ﬁrst- and second- order optimal in the wideband regime. To generalize the result in [11] and to determine how the multiple sources of mismatch introduced in this paper affect c 1 and c 2 , we start directly with the expression of I bicm (snr) deﬁned in Eq. (12). For simplicity, we use natural logarithms. In order to ﬁnd c 1 and c 2 , we need the second- and forth-order derivatives of f j (ρ, x, b, s) with respect to ρ, respectively.\nThe ﬁrst-order derivative of f j (ρ, x, b, s) with respect to ρ is given by [9]\nj (ρ, x, z, b) +\nhigh-SNR regime of the BICM schemes described previously. In particular, we will pay particular attention to BICM 2 , where the reference constellation is different from the transmitted one. To do this, we rewrite the expression of I bicm (snr) in (11) as\nwhere we isolated the snr-dependent term, ˆ H snr (X|Y ), ˆ H snr (X|Y )\nWe now focus on the high-SNR behavior of ˆ H snr (X|Y ). When snr → ∞, for ﬁxed b and y (or x), the channel tends to a noiseless channel, and the limiting value of the log term in (29) can be calculated as\n(30) where\nWhen snr → ∞, the term ˆ H snr (X|Y ) in (29) converges to (32) at the bottom of the page. This characterizes the saturating value of the GMI for high SNR for a general reference constellation. In particular, for schemes with equal transmit and reference constellation, i.e., ˆ X = X , Eq. (30) tends to 0 at high SNR, hence Eq. (32) also tends to 0 at high SNR,\npossible GMI values with a ﬁxed input distribution. It turns out that this interpretation also gives an accurate estimation of the irregular behavior of BICM 2 for E b N\nranging from 0 to 2 dB.\nWe have studied the performance in terms of achievable rates of BICM with mismatched shaping strategies. We have considered schemes where the decoder employs a reference constellation that assumes that the symbols have been used with equal probability and we have studied both low- and high-SNR regimes. We have seen that the loss of this scheme with respect to a fully optimized BICM scheme is marginal at low SNR. In the case the decoder uses the same constellation as the transmitter while still assuming equiprobable symbols, the loss is negligible in all the range of SNRs."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"E.
