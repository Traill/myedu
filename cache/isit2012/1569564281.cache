The encoding oper- ation is a simple one-to-one mapping from the information messages to the IC codewords. The decoding operation is equivalent to ﬁnding the \u201cclosest\u201d 1 IC codeword to the cor- responding channel output. Lattices are the subset of linear ICs. As such they are usually more convenient for encoding and decoding. The notion of a lattice code as a form of coded-modulation is not new. It dates back to a 1975 paper by de-Buda [1]. As is the case with all codes, the most important baseline feature for analysis of a lattice is its error performance. A widely accepted framework for lattice codes\u2019 error analysis is commonly referred to as Poltyrev\u2019s setting [2]. In Poltyrev\u2019s setting the code\u2019s shaping region, deﬁned as the ﬁnite subset of the otherwise inﬁnite set of lattice points, is ignored, and the lattice structure is analyzed for its packing properties only. Consequently, the usual rate variable R is inﬁnite and replaced by the Normalized Log Density (NLD) δ. The lattice analogous to Gallager\u2019s random-coding error exponent [3], over a random linear codes ensemble, is Poltyrev\u2019s error exponent over a set of lattices of constant density.\nBoth Gallager and Poltyrev\u2019s error exponents are asymptotic measures of the exponential behavior of the average error probability over an ensemble. Consequently, the error expo- nent is often a crude upper bound for the error probability in ﬁnite dimension n. Moreover, it is an average property of the ensemble and does not imply much about a speciﬁc code. Various upper error bounding techniques and bounds for speciﬁc codes and code families have been constructed for linear codes over discrete channels [4]. On the other hand, only a few bounds have been devised for lattices over particular continuous channels [5].\nOne simple and practical bounding technique for the dis- crete case was derived in [6]. The bound and its various extensions provide error bounds for speciﬁc codes or code families, as a function of their distance spectrum. Despite its simple derivation and form, it has led to signiﬁcant results in coding theory. Amongst those is the error analysis for Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding of LDPC codes [7].\nOne result of this paper is a simple upper bound on the error probability of speciﬁc lattice codes or code families over continuous channels, as a function of their distance spectrum. The bound is constructed by replacing the well- known Minkowski-Hlawka theorem [8] with a non-random alternative. Although tighter distance spectrum based bounds for special ﬁnite dimension lattices exist, an interesting and unique outcome of this bound is an error exponent for speciﬁc lattice sequences. As a corollary to that exponent, knowledge of a sequence\u2019s distance spectrum directly reveals its gap to capacity. Although the focus of this paper is circularly- symmetric continuous noise channels, the results are easily extendable to general non-symmetric channels.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II provides preliminary background, section III presents the derivation of the Minkowski-Hlawka non-random alternative, section IV outlines a well-known general ML decoding upper bound, section V applies our new techniques to the general bound of section IV, section VI presents a new error exponent for speciﬁc lattice sequences over AWGN channels, and the ﬁnal section concludes this work with two simple examples.\nA lattice Λ is a discrete n-dimensional subgroup of the Euclidean space R n that is an Abelian group under addition. A generating matrix G of Λ is an n×n matrix with real valued coefﬁcients constructed by concatenation of a properly chosen set of n linearly independent vectors of Λ. The generating matrix G deﬁnes the lattice Λ by Λ = {λ : λ = Gu, u ∈ Z n }. A fundamental parallelepiped of Λ, associated with G is the set of all points p = n i=1 u i g i where 0 ≤ u i < 1 and {g i } n i=1 are the basis vectors of G. The lattice determinant, deﬁned as det Λ ≡ |deg G|, is also the volume of the fundamental parallelepiped. Denote by β and δ the density and NLD of Λ respectively; thus β = e nδ = (det Λ) −1 .\nThe lattice-dual of the random linear codes ensemble, in ﬁnite-alphabet codes, is a set of lattices originally deﬁned by Siegel [9], [10], for use in proving what he called the mean-value theorem. This theorem, often referred to as the Minkowski-Hlawka-Siegel (MHS) theorem, is a central con- stituent in upper error bounds on lattices. The theorem states that for any dimension n ≥ 2, and any bounded Riemann- integrable function g(λ) there exists a lattice Λ of density β for which\nSiegel proved the theorem by averaging over a fundamental set 2 of all n-dimensional lattices of unit density. The drawback of this theorem is similar to the random-coding theorem. The theorem proves existence of good lattices but does not show how to ﬁnd them. Moreover it does not provide tools for analysis of speciﬁc lattices. An alternative to (1), constructed for speciﬁc lattices, based on their distance spectrum, is introduced later in this section.\nWe begin with a few deﬁnitions, before stating our central lemma. The lattice Λ 0 always refers to a speciﬁc known n- dimensional lattice of density β, rather than Λ which refers to some unknown, yet existing n-dimensional lattice. The lattice Λ 0 is the normalized version of Λ 0 (i.e. det(Λ 0 ) = 1). Deﬁne the distance series of Λ 0 as the ordered series of its unique norms {λ j } ∞ j=1 such that λ 1 is its minimal norm. {λ j } ∞ j=1 is deﬁned for Λ 0 respectively. The normalized continuous dis- tance spectrum of Λ 0 is deﬁned as N (x) = ∞ j=1 N j δ(x−λ j ), where {N j } ∞ j=1 is the ordinary distance spectrum of Λ 0 , and δ(·) is the dirac delta function. Let Γ denote the group 3 of all orthogonal n × n matrices with determinant +1 and let µ(γ) denote the normalized measure so that Γ dµ(γ) = 1. The notation γΛ 0 is used to describe the lattice generated by γG, where G is a generating matrix of the lattice Λ 0 .\nOur central lemma essentially expresses Siegel\u2019s mean- value theorem for a degenerate ensemble consisting of a speciﬁc known lattice Λ 0 and all its possible rotations around the origin.\nLemma 1 (\u201cNon-Random Mean-Value Theorem\u201d). Let Λ 0 be a speciﬁc n-dimensional lattice with NLD δ, and g(λ) be a Riemann-integrable function, then there exists an orthogonal rotation γ such that\n0 \t : x ≤ 0 \t (3) where V n is the volume of an n-dimensional unit sphere, and\nProof: Let Θ denote the space of all points θ in the n- dimensional space with θ = 1, so that Θ is the surface of the unit sphere. Let µ(θ) denote the ordinary solid-angle measure on this surface, normalized so that Θ dµ(θ) = 1. We continue with the following set of equalities\nwhere the third equality follows from the deﬁnition of Γ and Θ and the measures µ(γ) and µ(θ), the fourth equality is due to the circular symmetry of the integral term, and the sixth equality is a transformation from generalized spherical polar coordinates to the cartesian system (see Lemma 2 of [10]).\nFinally there exists at least one rotation γ ∈ Γ for which the sum over γΛ 0 is upper bounded by the average.\nThe corollary presented below is a restricted version of lemma 1 constrained to the case when the function g(λ) is circularly-symmetric, (i.e. g(λ) = g( λ )). To simplify the presentation, it is implicitly assumed that g(λ) is circularly- symmetric for the remainder of this paper. It should be noted that all results presented hereafter apply also to a non- symmetric g(λ) with an appropriately selected rotation γ of Λ 0 .\nCorollary 1. Let Λ 0 be a speciﬁc n-dimensional lattice with NLD δ, and g(λ) be a circularly-symmetric Riemann- integrable function, then\nThe right-hand side of (5), (or (2)), can be trivially upper bounded by replacing N(x) with a suitably chosen function α(x), so that\nProvided the substitution, it is possible to deﬁne the following simple upper bound. The bound is general up to choice of α(x), and clariﬁes the motivation for the substitution.\nTheorem 1 (\u201cNon-Random Minkowski-Hlawka\u201d - NRMH). Let Λ 0 be a speciﬁc n-dimensional lattice of density β, g(λ) be a bounded Riemann-integrable circularly-symmetric function, and α(x) be deﬁned such that (7) is satisﬁed, then\nProof: Substitute a speciﬁc α(x) for N(x) in (5), and upper bound by taking the maximum value of α(x) over the integrated region, outside the integral.\nOne should note that (8) could be met at equality with appropriate choice of α(x), though ﬁnding such α(x) may require a tedious numerical exploration. The added value in (8) stems from its simplicity, given any choice of α(x).\nWe now proceed to deﬁne an α(x) that is suitable for purposes of this paper and is optimal in some sense. For that, g(λ) is further constrained to be a monotonic, non-increasing function of λ . Let N (x) be a smoothed version of the normalized continuous distance spectrum, selected such that it satisﬁes\nGiven the above, α(x) can be deﬁned by expanding (7) as follows:\n: x > 0 0 \t : x ≤ 0\nwhere the equalities follow methods used in (4) together with g(λ)\u2019s circular-symmetry, and the inequality follows from g(λ) being monotonically non-increasing together with N (x) obeying (9).\nWe deﬁne {α i (x)} i∈I , the set of all functions α(x) such that (9) is satisﬁed and select α opt (x) = α j (x) such that the bound in (8) is tightest; thus by deﬁnition\nAs it turns out α opt (x) is a piecewise constant function. It is constant over shells deﬁned by consecutive radii from the normalized distance series {λ j } ∞ j=1 , (i.e. a shell is deﬁned by {x : λ j < x ≤ λ j+1 }). The function α opt (x) can be obtained as the solution to a linear program presented in [11].\nMany tight ML upper bounds originate from a general bounding technique, developed by Gallager [12]. Gallager\u2019s technique has been utilized extensively in literature [4], [13], [14]. Similar forms of the general bound, displayed hereafter, have been previously presented in literature [5], [15]. Playing a central role in our analysis, we present it as a theorem.\nBefore proceeding with the theorem, let us deﬁne an Additive Circularly-Symmetric Noise (ACSN) channel as an additive continuous noise channel, whose noise is circularly- symmetric and a non-increasing function of its norm.\nTheorem 2 (General ML Upper Bound). Let Λ be an n- dimensional lattice, and f z (ρ) the pdf of an ACSN channel\u2019s noise vector\u2019s norm, then the error probability of an ML decoder is upper bounded by\nwhere Ball(z, z ) is an n-dimensional ball of radius z centered around z.\nWe call the ﬁrst term of (13) the Union Bound Term (UBT) and the second term the Sphere Bound Term (SBT) for obvious reasons.\nThe ML decoding upper bound (13) is further bounded in three different methods, by exchanging the lattice sum\ng(λ) with various terms that bound it from above. The resulting applications vary in purpose, simplicity, and exhibit different performance. We present the applications and discuss their differences.\nApplication of the MHS theorem from (1), leads to the random-coding error bound on lattices. We quote the theorem. Theorem 3 (MHS Bound, Theorem 5 of [15]). Let f z (ρ) be the pdf of an ACSN channel\u2019s noise vector\u2019s norm, then there exists an n-dimensional lattice Λ of density β for which the error probability of an ML decoder is upper bounded by\nnoting that it is a bounded function of λ and continue to bound the UBT from (13) using (1). The remainder of the proof is presented in [11].\nSince this bound is based on the MHS ensemble average, it shows existence of a lattice Λ which is upper bounded by it. It does not however aid in ﬁnding such lattice; neither does it provide tools for examining speciﬁc lattices.\nUnlike the previous, application of the NRMH theorem provides a tool for examining speciﬁc lattices. Its appealing advantage is that it is essentially the MHS application multi- plied by a constant.\nTheorem 4 (NRMH Bound). Let a speciﬁc n-dimensional lattice Λ 0 of density β be transmitted over an ACSN channel with f z (ρ) the pdf of its noise vector\u2019s norm, then the error probability of an ML decoder is upper bounded by\n(17) with\nProof: Set g(λ) as in (16), noting that it is bounded by λ max = 2r. The remainder is identical to the proof of theorem 3 replacing β with βα.\nSince α opt (x) is a monotonically non-increasing function of x, optimization of r is usually possible using an iterative numerical algorithm. In the ﬁrst iteration, set r = (βV n ) −1/n and calculate α according to (18). In each additional iteration, set r = (βαV n ) −1/n and recalculate α. The algorithm is terminated on the ﬁrst iteration when α is unchanged.\nThis subsection is added for completeness. Here the UBT of (13) is upper bounded by bounding the probability term inside the integral. When the channel is restricted to AWGN, the\nresulting bound is similar to the Spherical Upper Bound of [5], hence the name. The bounding technique for the probability term, presented in the following lemma, is based on [16].\nLemma 2 (Appendix D of [16]). Let x be a vector point in n-space, z an isotropically distributed n-dimensional random vector, and ρ a real number then\nTheorem 5 (SUB). Let a speciﬁc n-dimensional lattice Λ 0 of density β be transmitted over an ACSN channel with f z (ρ) the pdf of its noise vector\u2019s norm, then the error probability of an ML decoder is upper bounded by\nwhere {λ j } ∞ j=1 and {N j } ∞ j=1 are the previously deﬁned dis- tance series and spectrum of Λ 0 respectively, and M is the largest index such that λ j ≤ 2r.\nProof: Bound the UBT of (13) directly, using (19). See [11].\nWhen the channel is AWGN with noise variance σ 2 , the upper error bound on the ML decoding of a \u201cgood\u201d 4 lattice from the MHS ensemble (14) can be expressed in the following exponential form [2], [15]\n \n, δ cr ≤ δ < δ ∗ 0, \t δ ≥ δ ∗\nApplying the method above to the upper error bound on a speciﬁc lattice from (17), it is possible to construct an error exponent for a speciﬁc lattice sequence based on its distance spectrum.\nTheorem 6 (Non-Random Coding Error Exponent). Let Λ 0 [n] be a lattice sequence transmitted over an AWGN channel with\nnoise variance σ 2 , then the error probability of an ML decoder is upper bounded by\nn log α[n]. \t (26) Proof: It follows from the proof of theorem 4, that\nreplacing β with βα[n] there, is equivalent to replacing δ with δ + ν[n] here.\nClearly (25) can be used to determine the exponential decay of the error probability of a speciﬁc lattice sequence. This leads us to the following corollary.\nCorollary 2. A lattice sequence for which ν[n] = o(1) achieves the unrestricted AWGN channel capacity δ ∗ .\nTwo examples are presented that display the simplicity and effectiveness of our new bound. The spectral data for the examples is taken from [17]. Both examples are calculated for an AWGN channel with noise variance σ 2 .\nIn the ﬁrst example presented in ﬁgure 1, the error probabil- ity of the Leech lattice Λ 24 is upper bounded by NRMH (17) and SUB (20). The ordinary Union Bound (UB), the MHS bound for dimension 24 (14), and the Sphere Lower Bound (SLB) of [18] are added for reference.\nIn the second example, the exponential decay series ν[n] is calculated for the ﬁrst three lattices of the Barnes-Wall lattice sequence BW 4 = D 4 , BW 8 = E 8 , and BW 16 = Λ 16 . Unfortunately the distance spectrum for BW n is generally unknown, preventing asymptotical analysis.
