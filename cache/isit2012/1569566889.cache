Up to now, the maximum capacity achievable by a decentralized protocol on the collision channel that allows one user to transmit at a time is still unknown and an open problem in this ﬁeld.\nWhile this classical collision channel model may reﬂect more of the physical (PHY) layers in the past, transceiver technologies today can separate and correctly decode multiple packets transmitted simultaneously over the channel. This capability is commonly referred to as multipacket reception (MPR) [2] [3]. But similarly, only little is known regarding such channel\u2019s multiaccess capacity as well.\nTo advance our understanding on this, in this paper we investigate properties of the general MPR channel and derive an upper bound of its multiaccess capacity. Our results here can provide insights into the limiting efﬁciency at which multiaccess can perform in the MPR environment. This will also be useful because researchers in recent years have been fo- cusing on the idea of cross-layer design for wireless networks with MPR [4] that concerns improving network performance through cooperation between the media access control (MAC) layer and MPR-capable physical layers.\nBecause the classical collision channel is a special case of the MPR channel, as it will become apparent below, the channel properties and capacity upper bound that we point out are in fact generalizations of well-known results from classical multiaccess theory.\nWhile networks in practice are of ﬁnite sizes, the inﬁnite population model has been analyzed in the literature because its performance results are indicative of that for large networks and can also provide a lower limit to the best that the ﬁnite population models can achieve. The inﬁnite population model can also make the analysis more amenable as it frees the analysis of any boundary conditions.\nBased on this model, Abramson [5] introduced the seminal random access protocol, ALOHA, which delivers a measly throughput of 1/2e ≈ 0.184 packets per slot. By aligning transmissions to occur at time-slot boundaries, Roberts [6] cre- ated the S-ALOHA that provides a throughput of 1/e ≈ 0.368.\nSoon after, Capetanakis [7] developed a tree-based splitting algorithm to resolve packet arrivals during an interval of time; it is stable for all arrival rates less than ≈ 0.431. Inspired by his work, there have been many subsequent research on collision resolution protocols that are founded on the idea of partitioning groups of multiple users, as documented in [8], [1] and the references therein. In particular, Gallager [9] proposed a ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-serve (FCFS) splitting algorithm with a capacity of ≈ 0.487. Apparently this protocol was also independently developed by Tsybakov and Mikhailov [10] and Ruget [11] as well Later, Moseley and Humblet [12] reﬁned that algorithm by enabling optimally sized subintervals for each split to improve the capacity to ≈ 0.488, which has since remained the highest achievable throughput reported for the collision channel.\nComplementing attempts to design the optimal protocol, researchers also have pursued upper limits for this channel\u2019s multiple access capacity, for which an actual protocol needs not exist to attain. Pippenger [13] used an information theoretic argument to show that ≈ 0.744 is an upper bound to the capac- ity. Later, Molle [14] derived an upper bound of ≈ 0.673 by employing a genie-aided protocol, which was then improved by Cruz and Hajek [15] with a slightly different genie to ≈ 0.613. Subsequently, by using sophisticated arguments that analyze the probabilities of the number of packets harbored in an interval, Mikhailov and Tsybakov [16] and Zheng and\nBerger [17] lowered the upper bound to ≈ 0.587 and ≈ 0.578, respectively. Finally, by incorporating these probabilistic ideas with the entropy gained about the arrival process from each transmission, like in [13], into a generalized splitting protocol, Tsybakov and Likhanov reported the currently lowest known upper bound of ≈ 0.568 in [18].\nOf course, today we know that with MPR techniques, physical layers can perform much better than the collision channel model. Ghez, Verd´u and Schwartz [2] [3] were the ﬁrst to analyze the S-ALOHA protocol and provided equations to calculate its capacity over the general symmetric MPR channel with inﬁnite population. Soon after, Mehravari [19] studied a splitting algorithm for a speciﬁc MPR channel \u2014 the N -user channel, that allows all transmissions to become successful when there are N or less. Tsybakov, Mikhailov and Likanov [20] also investigated the multiaccess capacity for this channel, deriving lower and upper bounds for it. In our earlier work [21], we provided conditions that the general MPR channel satisﬁes for S-ALOHA to performing optimally. We also proposed in [21] a genie-assisted protocol that gives an upper bound to the capacity of general MPR channels, although that protocol does not guarantee the FCFS policy, which should be essential for a fair multiple access protocol. The upper bound that we derive here will enforce this important policy. Note that the results in [2], [3] and [19] are rates of reliable data transmission that can be attained by protocols; as such, they represent lower bounds on the capacity of MPR channels. Other than [21] and this paper, no other upper bounds have previously been reported for the general MPR channel.\nWe should also contrast our paper\u2019s focus with many recent ones in the MPR literature. They investigate the performances of having MPR for speciﬁc multiple access schemes (eg. when used with power control) or certain network topologies (eg. multi-hop networks) or speciﬁc multiuser physical layers. Whereas, we extend from the classical approach to ﬁnd the fundamental multiple access performance over the general MPR channel with only the representative \u201c0/1/e\u201d feedback, i.e. knowledge of whether the channel was idle in the previous time slot or that it had successful or failed transmission(s).\nThe network model we consider is the same as that used in the literature and the works mentioned in Section I.A. In particular, we consider a network with an unbounded number of terminals contending to transmit data packets to a central base station. Our network uses a slotted-time system in which transmissions may begin only at the start of a slot and that every terminal is synchronized to the slots. We also assume packet transmissions are of constant length lasting the entire slot.\nEach terminal in this inﬁnite population model can have up to one packet to be transmitted at any time, be it a newly arrived packet or a so-called backlogged packet that needs to be retransmitted. Our packet arrival model is a homogeneous\nPoisson point process over the real time line, with mean measure equal to the unit rate λ scaled by the Lebesgue measure, where λ is ﬁnite.\nWe employ the symmetric MPR channel model of [2], with which the successful reception probabilities depend only on the number of packets transmitted in the slot. For the inﬁnite population scenario, given that n packets are transmitted, for 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, let\nC n,k = P [k packets are correctly received| n are transmitted]. Clearly, the symmetric MPR channel model is a generalized formulation and embodies as a special case the classical collision channel, which has C 1,0 = 0 and C n,0 = 1 for all n > 1.\nWe denote the expected number of packets correctly re- ceived from a transmission set of n STAs by\nand assume that its limit C = lim n→∞ C n exists, which is usually the case in practice [2]. For instance, it is natural to expect C = 0 because practical PHY layers have ﬁnite resources and hence cannot support an unbounded number of simultaneous transmissions. We deﬁne channel capacity to be\nnamely the maximum number of successes possible over all numbers of simultaneous transmissions for a given MPR channel.\nIn addition, we also assume that C n is concave in n, a property possessed by reasonable MPR channels. To see why, say we have n 1 < n 2 < arg sup n C n . Then it is unreasonable to expect C n 1 > C n 2 < C max because, if the channel is still capable of supporting more successful receptions even when greater than n 2 STAs transmit, then we should have C n 1 ≤ C n 2 . Similarly, say arg sup n C n < n 3 < n 4 , then we should have C n 3 ≥ C n 4 , because the channel can only yield fewer successes with an increasing number of transmitting STAs if there already are greater than arg sup n C n of them. It is possible for sup n C n to be achieved at more than one n, but with the concavity assumption this must occur over one and only one consecutive set of n\u2019s.\nWe remark that, staying true to the channel\u2019s symmetric na- ture, we assume those stations with packets received correctly are selected randomly in an equiprobable fashion from the transmission set, i.e., that each station in the set has probability k/n to have transmitted successfully. Consequently, we see that it is not possible for an MPR channel to enforce ﬁrst-in- ﬁrst-out (FIFO); however, we can still design our protocol to at least be FCFS, i.e., that the packets may not necessarily leave the system in the order they arrived, but their transmissions will be attempted simultaneously with or no later than packets that arrived after them.\nNote that when C max equals to inﬁnity, then n ∗ = ∞. Also, the minimum in (1) signiﬁes that it is not necessary to enable a larger group of active stations than n ∗ in order to achieve\nThe probabilistic reception nature of MPR channels actually presents a challenge in designing appropriate multiple access protocols. This is because the channel\u2019s random outcome statistics are repeatable only after inﬁnite trials, via the law of large numbers, as pointed out in [22]. Thus, unlike the collision channel, after a transmission, an MPR receiver may still be uncertain of whether there are any remaining active stations even when no transmission attempts are detected.\nNonetheless, despite this probabilistic nature, note that there is still a deterministic aspect to the reception outcome of a set of concurrent transmissions. If C n,k = 1 for some n ≥ 1 and some 1 ≤ k ≤ n, then we will know with certainty that the event of k successes has occurred, since it does so with probability one. Unfortunately unless C n,k = 1 occurs at a unique k for all n, we are still unable to deduce how many active stations transmitted. But when there are exploitable patterns as to where C n,k = 1, we can be sure of some speciﬁc events; this is in fact key to our derivations below.\nFor example, consider the N -user MPR channel that has C n,n = 1 for all n less than some number, N . Such a channel can emulate many spread spectrum systems used in practice in which multiuser detection can perform satisfactorily only when the SIR is below a certain level. If such a system detects no successes but sees evidence of transmission attempts, then it is certain at least N active stations have transmitted. Because of this property, we will refer these channels as the deterministic N -user MPR channels.\nFormalizing this deterministic property: We see that for all MPR channels, there exists an\nwhere we adopt the notation that C 0,0 = 1. Observe that the collision channel is a special case of this with n 0 = 1; the deterministic MPR channel discussed above has n 0 = N . Or for example, a collision channel in the presence of noise that can corrupt the packet has n 0 = 0. Note also that n ∗ ≥ n 0 ≥ 0 for all the channels we are considering here. As it turns out n 0 is an important variable in MAC design for an MPR channel as it helps characterize the randomness of an MPR channel. In the sections below, we will use the properties in n 0 to upper bound the MPR multiaccess capacity.\nIn general, we deﬁne a multiple access protocol to be stable if it can maintain a ﬁnite number of backlogged unserviced stations with probability one. An achievable throughput of a protocol is a packet arrival rate that it can sustain while keeping the system stable. By Little\u2019s theorem [23], this arrival rate is in fact also the rate at which packets are delivered when the system is at equilibrium (i.e., steady state). We deﬁne the capacity of a system to be the supremum over all throughput\nrates achievable by protocols. In an MPR environment, an illustrative performance measure is also how efﬁciently a protocol utilizes the offered capacity. Accordingly we deﬁne a protocol\u2019s efﬁciency to be its maximum throughput divided by the channel capacity (see also [19]). Interestingly, because the channel capacity for the collision channel is one, a protocol\u2019s throughput is then also its efﬁciency; thus, during all this time, in all the prior work listed above for the collision channel, they have in fact been examining the efﬁciencies of random multiple access protocols as well!\nIn deriving an upper bound of the capacity for the collision channel, Molle [14] employed a helpful \u201cgenie\u201d that provides information about the arrival process at no extra cost. A cycle begins when there are no known active stations and the genie- aided protocol enables a number of arrival points. Any active station at an enabled point will broadcast its packet. The cycle is complete and ends if among these enabled points there are no active stations or if there is only one active station, whose packet will have been transmitted correctly. When there are more than one active stations, then a collision has resulted and the genie publicly points out the locations of the next two closest and unknown active arrival points, which the protocol enables each separately (and successfully), thus ending the cycle. In the case of the Poisson limit, this is equivalent to the protocol enabling an interval in the arrival process. The opti- mal genie-aided protocol, which evidently is both FCFS and FIFO, enables the number of arrival points or interval length that maximizes throughput. Clearly, this obtained throughput is an upper bound to any unaided protocols because the genie- aided version can always discard the extra information to simulate any unaided protocols and achieve their throughputs.\nHowever, when using this approach, it is critical to choose a genie that is not \u201coverly helpful\u201d, otherwise the results would not be too meaningful. For example, as discussed in [14], consider a genie that labels the activeness of all the arrival points. In the collision channel, a protocol can then achieve perfect channel utilization (i.e., a throughput of one) by enabling each known active points separately.\nThough, it may not be entirely trivial to achieve the channel capacity on the MPR channel even with such a propitious genie. We pointed out in [21] that the upper bound of the MPR channel\u2019s capacity achieved with this genie is C max , when n ∗ number of stations transmit each time. And consequently, if C = C max for an MPR channel, then S-ALOHA with open- loop control is already optimal because it attains the channel capacity of C max in those conditions [21].\nIn light of this result, the quest for the MPR multiaccess capacity remains only for cases where C max > C. Towards that end, we generalize Molle\u2019s method [14] to ﬁnd an upper bound by selecting a similar but suitable genie for the MPR channel.\nAlthough his genie was designed speciﬁcally for the colli- sion channel, interestingly we can observe that after a collision\nhas incurred the genie actually labels the next n 0 + 1 = 2 active arrival points, which is in fact the least amount of active points (or information) to expose that would keep the original interval\u2019s Poisson distribution unchanged in the remaining interval. We call this effect return to fresh Poissonness. And an analogous and more generalized form is also displayed in the MPR environment, as captured by Lemma 1 below. We will denote by |[a 1 , a 2 ]| to be the number of arrival points in the closed interval [a 1 , a 2 ]; similar notation applies for open and semi-open intervals.\nLemma 1: In a homogeneous Poisson point process with intensity λ > 0 on some interval [a, b], when conditioned on the events that, (i) in another non-overlapping interval [c, d], where d < a, there is known to be L 0 number of points; (ii) |[a, b]| > n 0 − L 0 ≥ 0; (iii) the locations of L 1 ≥ 0 of these points in [a, b], U = {u 1 , . . . , u L 1 }, where u 1 < · · · < u L 1 , are known; and (iv) there is some a ≤ t < b such that there are L 2 ≥ 0 number of points in [a, t]\\U , with L 1 + L 2 ≥ n 0 +1−L 0 , then the number of points in the remaining interval of (t, b]\\U is still Poisson distributed with intensity λ.\nProof: Because interval [c, d] is disjoint from [a, b], it has no effect on the statistics of (t, b]\\U other than the condition it has L 0 points. Since events (iii) and (iv) imply the event |[a, b]| > n 0 − L 0 , P (|(t, b]\\U | = j | |[a, b]| > n 0 − L 0 , U , |[a, t]\\U | = L 2 ) = P (|(t, b]\\U | = j | U , |[a, t]\\U | =\nSince (t, b]\\U , [a, t] and U are disjoint subsets of [a, b], the events |(t, b]\\U | = j, U and |[a, t]\\U | = L 2 are all mutually independent. Thus, P (|(t, b]\\U | = j, U , |[a, t]\\U | = L 2 ) = P (|(t, b]\\U | = j)P (U , |[a, t]\\U | = L 2 ) = P (|(t, b]\\U | =\nEssentially Lemma 1 provides a guideline for the genie to disclose locations of the arrival points yet still maintaining the same Poisson distribution in the remainder of the interval. As long as we can ascertain that the transmission set from an enabled interval [a, b] has more than n 0 − L 0 arrival points, then the genie can do so by labelling all the arrival points up to t. This is true too when there are L 1 of the |[a, b]| arrival points successfully transmitted. It\u2019s also true even when L 0 known backlogged arrival points (possibly from a previously enabled interval [c, d]) is enabled simultaneously with [a, b]. And the smallest number of arrival points that the genie can provide while accomplishing this is L 2 = max{n 0 + 1 − L 0 − L 1 , 0}. Since we will know the number of successful arrival points from an enablement, then together with the genie\u2019s action the protocol can ascertain whether |[a, b]| > n 0 − L 0 and act accordingly. Namely, if L 0 + L 1 ≥ n 0 + 1, then the\ngenie should not label any new points in [a, b], which remains identically Poisson distributed from the protocol\u2019s point of view. Else, the genie should label all the unknown arrival points from a up to t, and the protocol knows that the interval from t onwards is identically Poisson distributed. In both cases, the genie re-labels any of the L 0 points in [c, d] that are still backlogged after their enablement.\nThe remaining issue now is how the protocol should pro- ceed with the genie-labelled active points to deliver the best throughput. From the properties established in Section II, we see that the optimal genie-aided protocol should always enable n ∗ points as often as possible in a cycle. Therefore, when there are at least n ∗ known arrival points, the protocol should enable the earliest n ∗ of these. (Note that the maximum number of known points at any given time when employing this genie can only be n ∗ + 1, since n∗ ≥ n 0 .) And, when there are less then n ∗ known arrival points, in order to uphold the FCFS policy, the protocol should enable all of these known points along with a new interval. Observe that our protocol and genie here is a generalization of Molle\u2019s protocol and genie for the collision channel, where n ∗ = n 0 = 1 and L 0 = L 1 = 0.\nLet random variables B and W be the the number of suc- cesses netted and expected number of transmissions expended by the protocol for a cycle. The throughput expression and performance for our genie-aided protocol is as follows.\nTheorem 1: The throughput of our genie-assisted protocol is E[B]/E[W ], with\nwhere p n = (λx) n e −λx n! , for n ≥ 0 and x ≥ 0, and B i and W i , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n 0 + 1, can be solved recursively as follows.\nC max + n ∗ k=0 C n ∗ ,k B n ∗ +1−k , for n ∗ + 1 / ∈ N , (10)\n(11) The maximum throughput attainable by our protocol is the maximum of E[B]/E[W ] over all x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\nThe derivation of (3)-(11) follows directly from the property of the MPR channel, the actions of the genie and the cor- responding protocol as we discussed. The maximum follows from the fact that E[B]/E[W ] is a convex combination over x and y. (A more detailed explanation is provided in [24].) Note that by substituting the collision channel\u2019s parameters (i.e., n ∗ = n 0 = 1 and L 0 = L 1 = 0) into (3)-(11), we can obtain Molle\u2019s capacity expression in [14].\nWith Theorem 1, we can derive the capacity upper bound for the N -user MPR channel. In Fig. 1 we plot this upper bound and other known results for this channel. Note that among the various bounds shown here, only the S-ALOHA protocol and our genie-aided upper bound have the distinction of being applicable for the general MPR channels.
