In this scenario, little is known about channel capacity since the channel matrices have a very general form where each path may have a different power. Hence, in this paper we consider the ergodic sum capacity of a macrodiversity MIMO system with arbitrary numbers of sources and antennas operating over Rayleigh fading channels. For this system, we compute a compact approximation to ergodic sum capacity, which is shown to be very accurate over a wide range of cases. Finally, we develop a highly simpliﬁed upper-bound which leads to insights into the relationship between capacity and the channel powers."},"body":{"text":"With the advent of network multiple input multiple output (MIMO) [1] and base station (BS) collaboration [2], it is becoming more common to consider MIMO links where the receive array, transmit array or both are widely separated. In these scenarios, individual antennas from a single effective array may be separated by a considerable distance. When both transmitter and receiver have distributed antennas, we refer to the link as a macrodiversity MIMO link. Little is known analytically about such links, despite their growing importance in research [3]-[4] and standards where coordinated multipoint transmission (CoMP) is part of 3GPP LTE Advanced.\nSome analytical progress in this area has been made recently in the analysis of linear combining for macrodiversity systems [5], [6]. However, there appears to be little work currently available on the capacity of general systems of this type. Similar work includes the capacity analysis of two-sided correlated Rayleigh channels [7] and the asymptotic macro- diversity results in [8] which gives a range of useful results and approximations. Also, there is work on system capacity for particular cellular structures, including Wyner\u2019s circular cellular array model [3] and the inﬁnite linear cell-array model [4]. Despite these contributions, the general macrodiversity model is difﬁcult to handle. The analytical difﬁculties are caused by the geographical separation of the antennas which results in entries of the channel matrix having different powers with an arbitrary pattern.\nIn this paper, we consider a macrodiversity MIMO multiple access channel (MIMO-MAC) where all sources and receive antennas are widely separated and all links experience inde- pendent Rayleigh fading. For this system, we consider the ergodic sum capacity, under the assumption of no channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters. We derive an approximation to capacity which is very accurate, but the func- tional form is awkward to interpret. Hence, a simple bound is developed which leads to insight into capacity behavior and its relationship with the channel powers.\nThe rest of the paper is laid out as follows. Section II describes the system model and Secs. III and IV develop accurate approximations and bounds on capacity. Results and conclusions appear in Secs. V and VI.\nConsider a MIMO-MAC uplink with M base stations and K users operating over independent Rayleigh channels where BS i has n R i receive antennas and user i has n i antennas. The total number of receive antennas is denoted n R = M i=1 n R i and the total number of transmit antennas is denoted N =\nwhere rrr is the C n R ×1 receive vector, sss is the combined C N ×1 transmitted vector from the K users, n n n is an additive white Gaussian noise vector, n n n ∼ CN 000, σ 2 III , and H H H ∈ C n R ×N is the composite channel matrix containing the K channel matrices from the K users. If no CSI at the transmitters is assumed, the corresponding ergodic sum capacity is [9]\nwhere E |s i | 2 = 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , N , is the power of each transmitted symbol 1 . It is convenient to label each column of H H H as h h h i for i = 1, 2, . . . , N . The covariance matrices of h h h k are deﬁned by P P P k = E h h h k h h h H k where P P P k = diag (P 1 k , P 2 k , . . . , P n R k ) and the (i, k) th element of H H H is CN (0, P ik ). we can also express h h h k as h h h k =\nk u u u k , where u u u k ∼ CN (000, III). For convenience, all the power information is\ncontained in the P P P k matrices and, in (2), the scaling factor in the capacity equation is simply 1/σ 2 . The results can also be extended to cover correlated channels, which may result from users or BSs having co-located antennas. This extension will appear in the forthcoming journal version of this paper.\nIn this section, we present an approximate ergodic sum rate capacity analysis 2 for the case where n R ≥ N ≥ 2. Extending this to N ≥ n R is a simple extension of the current analysis. We use the following notation for the channel matrix,\nwhere the n R × (k − 1) matrix, ˜ H H H k , comprises the k − 1 columns to the left of h h h k in H H H. The ergodic sum capacity is deﬁned by [9] as,\nIn order to facilitate our analysis, it is useful to avoid the logarithm representation in (5). We exchange logarithms for exponentials as follows. First, we note the identity,\nNow, equation (6) can be used to ﬁnd ln a as below: ∂ ln a\nt \t dt. \t (9) Applying (9) to (5) and taking expectation over h h h k , using Gaussian integral results [12], gives\n \n \nwhere Σ Σ Σ k = III + t σ 2 P P P k .

Hence, we employ a Laplace type approximation [10], giving\nJustiﬁcation of this version of the Laplace approximation is omitted for reasons of space. In Appendix A, a sketch proof is given for the expectation in the numerator of (12) giving\n(13) In (13), Q Q Q k is a power matrix deﬁned in Appendix A and Perm (.) denotes the permanent of a matrix [11]. The superscript, σ i,k−1 indicates a length i ordered subset of {1, . . . , k − 1}. (Q Q Q k ) σ i,k−1 denotes the submatrix of Q Q Q k formed by taking only columns indexed by σ i,k−1 and all rows. The summation is over all such subsets. Similarly, (X X X) σ ,n denotes the submatrix of X X X formed by taking only rows indexed by σ ,n and all columns and (X X X) µ ,n σ ,n denotes the submatrix of X X X formed by taking only the rows and columns indexed by σ ,n and µ ,n respectively.\nIn Appendix B, a sketch proof is given for the expectation in the denominator of (12) giving\nt l ϕ kl \t (15) = \t Θ (Q Q Q k )\n(t + ω kl ) , \t (17) where\nNote that ω kl > 0 for all l, k from Descartes\u2019 rule of signs as all the coefﬁcients of the monomial in the denominator of (16) are positive. Also note that, from (41), we have Θ (Q Q Q k ) = ϕ k0 .

Then, applying (24) in (4) gives the ﬁnal approximate ergodic sum rate capacity in a surprisingly simple form\nIn this section, we derive an extremely simple upper-bound for the ergodic capacity in (2). This provides a simpler relationship between the average link powers and ergodic sum capacity at the expense of a loss in accuracy. Using Jensen\u2019s inequality and ¯ γ = 1 σ 2 , equation (2) leads to\nAdapting Appendix A to handle H H H instead of ˜ H H H k allows (26) to be rewritten as\nwhere P P P = (P ik ). For small systems, expanding the perma- nents in (27) reveals the simple relationship between the upper bound and the channel powers. For n R = N = 2, (27) gives\nThis example shows the pattern where cross products of L channel powers scale the ¯ γ L term. Hence, at low SNR where the ¯ γ term is dominant, log 2 (1 + P T ¯ γ), where P T =\nP ik , is an approximation to (28). Similarly, at high SNR, the ¯ γ N term is dominant and log 2 1 + Perm (P P P ) ¯ γ N\nis an approximation. Hence, capacity is affected by the sum of the channel powers at low SNR, whereas at high SNR, the\nSc.

Results for these low and high SNR approximations are shown in Sec. V.\nWe consider three distributed BSs with either a single receive antenna or two antennas. For a two-source system, we parameterize the system by three parameters [5], [6]. The average received signal to noise ratio is deﬁned by ρ = P T /σ 2 . In particular, for a two-source system, ρ = (Tr (P P P 1 ) + Tr (P P P 2 )) /σ 2 and the total signal to interference ratio is deﬁned by ς = Tr (P P P 1 ) /Tr (P P P 2 ). The spread of the signal power across the three BS locations is assumed to be exponential, so that a range of possibilities can be covered with one parameter. The exponential proﬁle is deﬁned by\nand α > 0 is the parameter controlling the uniformity of the powers across the antennas. Note that as α → 0 the received power is dominant at the ﬁrst location, as α becomes large (α 1) the third location is dominant and as α → 1 there is an even spread. Using these parameters, four scenarios are given in Table I for the case of two single antenna users. In Fig. 1, we explore the capacity of scenarios S1- S4 where n R = 3. The approximation in (25) is shown to be extremely accurate. All capacity results are extremely similar except for S1, where both sources have their dominant path at the ﬁrst receive antenna. Here, the system is largely overloaded (two strong signals at a single antenna) and the performance is lower. The similarity of S3 and S4 is interesting as they represent very different systems. In S3, the two users are essentially separate with the dominant channels being at different antennas. In S4, both users have power equally spread over all antennas.\nFigure 2 shows results for a random drop scenario (see [6]) with n R = 6, M = 3, K = N = 6. In each random drop, uniform random locations, lognormal shadow fading and path loss are considered where σ SF = 8dB (standard deviation of shadow fading) and the path loss exponent is 3.5. The transmit power of the sources is scaled so that all locations in the coverage area have a maximum received SNR at the three BSs greater than 3dB, at least 95% of the time. Hence, each drop produces a different P P P matrix and independent channels are\nassumed. So that the different drops are comparable, each P P P matrix is scaled so that the total power, P T , is constant for each drop. The excellent agreement between the approximation in (25) and the simulations in Fig. 2 is encouraging as this demonstrates the accuracy of (25) over different system sizes as well as over completely different sets of channel powers. In Figs. 1 - 2, at low SNR the capacity is controlled by P T . Hence, since ρ = P T /σ 2 , all four drops have similar performance at low SNR and diverge at higher SNR where the channel proﬁles affect the results. In Fig. 3, the upper bound is shown for a random drop with M = n R = 6, K = N = 6. High and low SNR approximations are also shown. The results clearly show the loss in accuracy resulting from the use\nof the simple Jensen bound. However, the bound is quite reasonable over the whole SNR range. The low and high SNR approximations become reasonable at more widely spread SNR values. For example, the low SNR results are accurate below -5 dB and the high SNR results are poor until around 15 dB. Hence, although there is a noticeable capacity error at high SNR, the cross-product coefﬁcients in (28) are seen to explain the large majority of the ergodic capacity behavior.\nIn this paper, we have studied the ergodic sum capacity of a Rayleigh fading macrodiversity MIMO-MAC. The approxima- tions have a simple form and are shown to be very accurate over a wide range of channel powers. In addition, a simple upper bound is presented which demonstrates the importance of various channel power cross products in determining ca- pacity. The mathematical approach to random matrices having an arbitrary power structure may well have applications in multivariate statistics and other areas.\nLet λ 1 , λ 2 , . . . , λ k−1 be the ordered eigenvalues of ˜ H H H H k ˜ H H H k .
