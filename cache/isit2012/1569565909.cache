However, the shrinking size of mobile devices poses a serious threat to the viability of this technique. Alternatively, spatio-temporal diversity can also be exploited using cooperative communications [1]. In a cooper- ative communication system, dedicated relays are introduced which receive, process and forward the source message to the destination nodes. Alternatively, the network nodes might cooperate amongst themselves while sending and/or receiving information. This cooperative diversity offers advantages over traditional wireless networks in terms of an increased through- put and/or a higher reliability. It also provides the multiplexing and diversity gains which are typically associated with multi- antenna communications [2].\nIn order to exploit spatial diversity in wireless networks, various cooperation protocols have been proposed (see [3] and references therein). These protocols can generally be divided into three categories, namely, Decode-and-Forward (DF), Amplify-and-Forward (AF), and Compress-and-Forward (CF). In DF, a cooperating node attempts to decode the infor- mation from a source before re-encoding it and forwarding to the destination. On the other hand, in AF and CF strategies, the nodes need not decode the source information to cooperate. In AF, the nodes simply amplify and forward the received analog signal, whereas in CF, the nodes quantize the received information before compressing the quantization indices and forwarding to the destination. Detailed comparative analyses\nof the cooperation schemes for the point-to-point communi- cation link have been presented from an information-theoretic viewpoint in [1], [2].\nWith the growing popularity of mobile multimedia applica- tions, the importance of investigating cooperation for a multi- cast/broadcast setting can not be over-emphasized. Several re- cent works have focused on the cooperative multicast problem (see [4] and references therein). More recently, a cooperative wireless multicast setting was investigated in [5] using the traditional two-hop multicast scheme with ﬁxed-rate codes. As opposed to the ﬁxed-rate cooperation of [5], we propose a cooperation strategy based on rateless coding, due to which the users can decode adaptively and forward the information the moment decoding is successful. In addition, we present a hybrid relaying strategy which uses a combination of AF and DF, thus making sure that users start relaying even if they have not decoded the source message \u2013 we call it the ADF strategy. We employ the bucket-ﬁlling approach of [6] for performance evaluation in terms of the outage behavior. Simulation results indicate the superiority of our hybrid approach over individual rateless coded AF and DF schemes, as well as the ﬁxed-rate two-hop scheme of [5].\nWe consider a Gaussian multicast channel consisting of a base-station (source) and a cluster of N users, where all the users need the same message from the source. All the users as well as the base-station are assumed to employ a single receive/transmit antenna. Let c i be the complex channel gain between the base-station and user i, i = 1, . . . , N , and c ij be the complex channel gain between user i and j, with c ij = c ji . All links are assumed to experience independent identically distributed (i.i.d) block ﬂat Rayleigh fading with E[|c ij | 2 ] = 1 and E[|c i | 2 ] = 1/ξ where ξ ≥ 1 accommodates the fact that the source-user links may experience a greater path loss compared with the inter-user links (possibly because the inter- user distances may be smaller compared to the source-to-user distances). It is assumed that nodes have no channel state information (CSI) except as required for decoding. Let X[n] and X i [n] be the transmitted signal from the base-station and user i at time n, respectively. The received signal Y i [n] at user\nwhere Z i [n] denotes the zero-mean, additive i.i.d circularly symmetric complex Gaussian noise. Without loss in generality, we assume that the noise is of unit variance. In addition, we assume that the source as well as all the users employ the same average transmit power P , and therefore have the same average transmit signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. SNR s = SNR u = SNR = P . The total system signal-to-noise ratio is then given as SNR t = (N + 1)SNR. For evaluating the performance of the proposed cooperation strategies, we consider the outage behavior at the individual users. A user declares an outage if it is not able to decode at the target rate R. Let R i (c, SNR) be the achievable rate at user i as a function of the SNR and the set c of all channel gains. The outage probability p i (R, SNR) at user i is then deﬁned as the probability that the achievable rate R i (c, SNR) is less than the target rate R. Another outage measure we will employ is the outage rate. The outage rate at user i for a given outage probability p is deﬁned as the maximum rate at which the base-station could transmit such that the user is able to decode it with an outage probability not exceeding p. Mathematically,\nNote that because of channel symmetry, the outage rate and the outage probability for all users will be identical, i.e. R o i (p, SNR) = R o (p, SNR), and p i (R, SNR) = p (R, SNR) ∀\ni = 1, . . . , N . Thus, without loss in generality, we will con- sider the outage behavior of user 1 for performance analysis.\nIn this section, we will present the proposed rateless coded hybrid ADF strategy, along with an algorithm for evaluating the performance. In addition, we will also discuss the rateless coded DF strategy, as well as the information theoretic upper bound. However, we ﬁrst present the performance analysis for a non-cooperative multicast channel.\nIn non-cooperative multicast, the users do not transmit. The achievable rate at user i is simply given as\nwhere we have assumed that the base-station uses all available system power. This ensures a fair comparison of cooperative and non-cooperative multicast since both employ the same system power. Since |c i | 2 follows an exponential distribution, the outage probability for a given target rate R is given as\nOn the other hand, the outage rate for a given outage proba- bility p can be determined from (3) as\nAn upper bound on the achievable rate at a given user can be obtained using the cut-set arguments [7]. This upper bound for user 1 is given as\nThe outage probability and the outage rate corresponding to the upper bound can be evaluated numerically.\nMost works on cooperative wireless multicast (see [5] and references therein) consider the ﬁxed-rate two-hop DF relaying strategy in which the base-station broadcasts in the ﬁrst stage using ﬁxed-rate codes while the users attempt to decode the source message. In the second stage, only those users which have decoded the message correctly in the ﬁrst stage are allowed to relay, while the base-station and remaining users remain silent. We argue that this scheme fails to enhance user cooperation due to its non-adaptive nature. The biggest drawback is that only those users are allowed to relay who successfully decode the source message at the end of the ﬁrst stage. This effectively bars all the remaining users from coop- erating even though they could possibly decode the message in the second stage. Similarly, the successful users have to wait till the start of the second stage before they could participate in relaying. As opposed to the ﬁxed-rate two-hop scheme of [5], we propose a cooperative multicast scheme which incorporates rateless coding at all the nodes. It can leverage the cooperative advantages as the users decode adaptively and are allowed to start relaying/cooperating as soon as they succeed in decoding. In addition, rateless codes can adapt to channel variations and thus provide reliable yet efﬁcient communication. We now present the proposed rateless-coded relaying strategies.\n1) DF Cooperation: We ﬁrst explain the rateless-coded DF scheme. In this scheme, the base-station broadcasts the message using rateless codes with a signal-to-noise ratio SNR s , while the users try to decode the source message. Let D be the set of users to have decoded the message at any given time while D c be {1, ..., N }/D, where / implies subtraction. If a user succeeds in decoding the source message, it stops listening and starts forwarding the decoded information using SNR u . It is further assumed that the base-station as well as the users transmit from independent rateless codebooks.\nFor outage detection, we use the bucket ﬁlling approach of [6] where each user is assigned an information bucket of unit volume. A full information bucket indicates that the user is capable of decoding the source message. If the users are subjected to a peak power constraint, the information bucket ﬁll-rate for user i ∈ D c can be expressed as\nHowever, in case of an energy or an average power con- straint at the individual users, the modiﬁed ﬁll-rate expression is given as\n|c ij | 2 SNR u 1 − Rt d [j]\nwhere t d [j] is the normalized time at which user j ∈ D decodes its message and R is the target rate. As a user does not transmit till it decodes, the normalization factor (1 − Rt d [j]) ensures that it consumes all of its available energy in relaying. We refer to the DF schemes corresponding to (6) and (7) as (un-normalized) DF, and normalized DF, respectively. As opposed to normalized DF where each user is allowed to use a scaled transmit power P/(1 − Rt d [i]]) while relaying, un-normalized DF requires all the users to relay with a transmit power not greater than P , regardless of the time at which they decode the source message. It can be veriﬁed that if SNR u = 0, and SNR s = SNR t , both (6) and (7) degenerate to the ﬁll-rates corresponding to the direct non-cooperative multicast case. We now describe the bucket-ﬁlling algorithm that we use for outage detection:\n∀i ∈ D c 06 : \t Calculate minimum ﬁll time: t m = min i∈D c (t i )\nUsing Monte-Carlo simulations, this outage-detection algorithm can be used to calculate the outage probability, as well as the outage rate.\n2) Hybrid ADF Cooperation: In DF, users start to cooper- ate only after they have decoded the source message. However, it is possible to have further improvement in performance if the users yet to decode also participate in relaying. With this mo- tivation, we propose a hybrid Amplify/Decode-and-Forward (ADF) relaying strategy in which AF is used in conjunction with DF. In ADF, the users transmit the ampliﬁed versions of\nthe received symbols while simultaneously trying to decode the source message. When a user succeeds in decoding the source message, it stops amplifying and starts forwarding the decoded version using a rateless code. 1 Meanwhile, the base- station also continues to transmit using an independent rateless code. It is assumed that the base-station transmits until either all the users have decoded the message, or a certain maximum time is elapsed. We propose two different ADF strategies which are described below in detail.\nMulti-Slot ADF (ADF-MS): In multi-slot ADF, the total available bandwidth is initially divided into N+1 orthogonal bands(slots) of equal width \u2013 one for the base-station and one for each of the N users. In order to improve the spectral efﬁciency, the users/base-station are allowed to redistribute their bandwidth such that there are |D c | + 1 orthogonal bands at any given time: The base-station and the users belonging to the set D transmit in the same band (we call it the source band) from independent rateless codebooks while each of the remaining users (belonging to the set D c ) employ their respective bands to amplify and forward what they receive in the source band. It should be noted that each user listens to the transmission in all the bands except the one in which it transmits \u2013 thus ADF-MS is half-duplex. The signal Y s i\nwhere Z s i represents the noise in the source band at user i. Since the total bandwidth is divided into |D c | + 1 bands of equal width, the variance of the AWGN Z s i [n] is given as (|D c | + 1) −1 . Similarly, the source band signal Y j i ampliﬁed by user j (∀j ∈ D c ) that is received at user i is given as\nwhere Z j i is the corresponding noise with E[|Z j i | 2 ] = (|D c | + 1) −1 and A j is the ampliﬁcation factor employed by user j. The value for A j can be computed directly from the constraint A 2 j E[|Y s j | 2 ] = SNR u , and is given as\nSimilar to the previous scheme, we can use the bucket-ﬁlling algorithm to detect outages for ADF-MS. In order to obtain the expression for the ﬁll-rate, we represent the signals received at a user i∈ D c in matrix form as:\nwhere the vector Y i consists of the received signal in each of the (|D c | + 1) receiving bands at user i, with each signal com- ponent scaled by the standard deviation of the corresponding\nThe vector X = [X s , · · · , X j , · · · ] T ∀j ∈ D is a collection of the signals being transmitted from the source and the users in the set D, and H i is the corresponding (|D c |+1)×(|D|+1) coefﬁcient matrix for user i which could be easily computed from (8)\u2013(10). The equivalent noise vector Z i has i.i.d. AWGN elements of unit variance. The information bucket ﬁll-rate for user i ∈ D c can be calculated using [9]\n(12) where (.) ∗ represents conjugate transpose, R X is the covari- ance matrix of the vector X and I |D c |+1 is an identity matrix of order |D c | + 1. Since the base-station and successful users are assumed to transmit from independent rateless codebooks, we have R X = I D+1 SNR.\nDual-Slot ADF (ADF-DS): We now present the dual-slot ADF scheme in which the total available bandwidth is divided equally into two frequency slots. Similar to ADF-MS, the base-station and successful users transmit in the same frequency band using independent rateless codebooks. The difference from ADF-MS is that all the remaining users now share the same frequency band (we call it the AF band) to amplify and forward the information symbols received in the source band. Hence, the modiﬁed expression for the signal received at user i in the AF band is\nwhere Y s j and A j are the same as given in (8) and (10), respectively, and with E[|Z s i | 2 ] = E[|Z AF i | 2 ] = 1/2. As before, we can express the received signals at a user i ∈ D c in matrix form as\nconsisting of the signals received in the two frequency bands at user i scaled by the standard deviation of the equivalent noise. The vector X is the same as in ADF-MS, ˜ H i is the corresponding (2 × (|D| + 1)) coefﬁcient matrix, and ˜ Z i is the noise vector with i.i.d elements of unit variance. We again use the bucket-ﬁlling approach for outage detection. The ﬁll-rates for this scheme can be calculated using [9]\nSince all the codebooks are assumed to be independent, we have R X = I D+1 SNR. It should be noted that ADF-DS is inherently full-duplex because the users transmit and receive simultaneously in the AF band.\nWe now present the results obtained using Monte Carlo simulations for each one of the schemes mentioned above. Fig. 1 shows the outage probability vs the total system signal- to-noise ratio SNR t curves for N =10 users, target rate R = 0.1 b/s/Hz and ξ = 5. It can be observed that cooperative schemes provide an appreciable gain in performance compared to the non-cooperative (direct) multicast. Furthermore, a comparison between the discussed rateless-coded strategies and the ﬁxed- rate two-hop scheme shows that the former provides a signiﬁ- cant gain over the latter. For example, at an outage probability of p = 0.02, ADF-MS outperforms the two-hop strategy by a margin of approximately 3.4 dB. It can also be seen that\nthe rateless coded hybrid ADF cooperation outperforms the individual AF 2 and DF schemes. For instance, at an outage probability of p = 0.02, ADF-MS outperforms rateless coded AF and normalized DF cooperation by approximately 1.3 and\n2.5 dB, respectively. Moreover, the performance gap between ADF and rateless-coded DF cooperation increases further (by approximately 0.3 dB at p = 0.02) if we impose a peak power constraint at individual users. This is because un-normalized DF fails to consume the total available energy at the nodes and performs worse than the normalized DF scheme.\nFor a ﬁxed outage probability p=0.02, Fig. 2 shows the outage rate plotted against the system energy per bit E b = (N +1)SNR R o (p,SNR) for N =10 users and ξ = 5. It is evident that the ADF schemes provide signiﬁcant reduction in the required E b compared to individual AF and DF strategies as well as the two-hop scheme, specially in the low-power/low-rate regime. For ex- ample, with ADF-MS, the energy per bit required to achieve an outage rate of 0.05 b/s/Hz is 1.6, 2.8 and 3.4 dB less than that required by rateless coded AF, rateless coded normalized DF cooperation, and two-hop DF cooperation, respectively. Thus the proposed cooperation strategies are of particular interest in applications such as wireless sensor networks where nodes have limited energy resources and/or the required spectral efﬁciencies are low. It can also be seen that at relatively higher rates, ADF-DS performs better than ADF-MS. This makes intuitive sense since in ADF-DS the total bandwidth is divided into only two equal slots, as opposed to (D c +1) slots in ADF- MS which plays a role in decreasing the spectral efﬁciency of ADF-MS over ADF-DS at relatively higher signal-to-noise ratios. Also, the curves for AF and both the ADF schemes exhibit a dipping behavior (near the axis) indicating that the minimum value of E b is achieved for a non-zero spectral efﬁciency. This is consistent with the results in [10] in which a similar behavior was observed for AF cooperation in a three- node relay network under an ergodic rate setting.\nFigs. 3 and 4 show similar results for ξ = 2 where the performance of rateless coded AF degrades compared to normalized DF. However, the hybrid ADF still outperforms its nearest competitor by a handsome margin. For example, it can be seen from Fig. 3 that the performance gap between ADF- MS and normalized DF is approximately 1.42 dB at p = 0.02. Similarly, in Fig. 4 ADF-MS outperforms normalized DF by 1.35 dB at an outage rate of 0.05 b/s/Hz.\nIn this paper, we explored an i.i.d fading cooperative mul- ticast channel employing rateless coding at each node. We proposed a hybrid ADF cooperation that uses amplify-forward in conjunction with decode-forward cooperation. Using outage probability and outage rate as performance measures, the pro- posed hybrid scheme was shown to signiﬁcantly outperform the individual ratless-coded AF and DF schemes, as well as the ﬁxed-rate two-hop relaying strategy."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"N.
