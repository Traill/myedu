The characterization of the capacity region for a two-user IC is an open problem except for the strong and very strong interference cases [1]\u2013[3]. To date, the largest achievable rate region is the celebrated Han-Kobayashi (HK) region that employs rate splitting at the transmitters and simultaneous decoding at the receivers [3]. Not surprisingly, for those ICs whose capacity regions are completely characterized, it is without an exception that the capacity region coincides with the HK region.\nHowever, the general HK region involves a time sharing variable that makes its evaluation intractable. For the Gaussian interference channel (GIC), another difﬁculty is the input distribution. A two-user GIC in its standard form can be represented as\nwhere X 1 and X 2 are the input signals and are subject to respective power constraints P 1 and P 2 ; Y 1 and Y 2 are the received signals; Z 1 and Z 2 are Gaussian noises of unit variance and are independent of the inputs X 1 and X 2 . This model is depicted in Fig. 1. While for all the cases where the capacity results are known for a GIC, the optimal input distribution is invariably Gaussian, it is not yet known (or proven) that such is the case for the general GIC.\nThere has been recent progress in obtaining computable subregion of the HK achievable region using Sato\u2019s non-na¨ıve frequency division [4]. For the one-sided GIC (denoted as ZGIC) shown in Fig. 2(a), Motahari and Khandani established that such a non-na¨ıve frequency division scheme achieves the HK region with Gaussian input [5]. Most recently, Costa intro- duced the so-called noiseberg scheme which uses water ﬁlling to achieve optimal power sharing between two orthogonal\ndimensions [6]. It turns out, as shown in the next section, that this simple noiseberg scheme achieves precisely the same HK region with Gaussian input.\nThis paper focuses on GICs with mixed interference (MGIC) and with ab ≥ 1, a ≤ 1 and b ≥ 1 (cf. Fig. 1 and Eq. (1)). We describe a simple coding scheme that combines the noiseberg scheme with that of simultaneous decoding at the receiver experiencing strong interference. The obtained rate region is subsequently shown to coincide with the HK region with Gaussian input.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review the noiseberg scheme for the ZGIC and provide a proof of its equivalence to the HK region with Gaussian input. Section III describes the coding scheme for a class of MGIC and proves that the scheme achieves the HK region with Gaussian input. Section IV concludes this paper.\nWe consider the degraded GIC shown in Fig. 2(b), which is equivalent to the ZGIC with a < 1 in Fig. 2(a) [7].\nThe noiseberg region, denoted by R N and introduced by Costa in [6] for a ZGIC with weak interference ( a < 1 in Fig. 2(a)) is the set of all nonnegative rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying\nand the power limits P 1A , P 1B and P 1C are determined by two parameters h and λ such that\nCosta [6] showed that R N is achievable for the ZGIC with weak interference by a coding scheme that uses a two- band non-na¨ıve frequency division multiplexing (FDM) with water ﬁlling for optimal power allocation between the two subbands. The coding scheme, as well as its achievable region, involves two parameters 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 and h ≥ 0. They vary over the admissible region as shown in Fig. 3, resulting in different transmission schemes depending on the values of the parameters. The parameter λ determines how to allocate the frequency band.\n\u2022 The λ subband is reserved for the communication be- tween transmitter 1 and receiver 1.\n\u2022 The ¯ λ subband is shared by both transceiver pairs and the corresponding coding scheme is determined by the other parameter h.\nAs the noise Z 2 does not affect the transmission of X 1 , water ﬁlling allows the overall power level in the λ-subband to be raised above that of the ¯ λ-subband, with part of the noise spectrum of Z 2 ﬂoating above the signal level. This phe- nomenon, i.e., the existence of difference in heights of power spectrum for the two subbands is referred to as the noiseberg. The parameter h is deﬁned as the height of total power density in the λ-subband above that of X 2 \u2019s power density in the ¯λ-subband. Different h values divide the admissible region\nfor the parameter pairs into two regions, each employing a different coding scheme in the ¯ λ-subband:\nMultiplex region This corresponds to h ≤ 1 −a 2 a 2 . As shown in Fig. 4, Z 2 prevents user 1\u2019s power from spilling over to the ¯λ-band thus no rate-splitting is involved. Receiver 2 decodes W 1 ﬁrst, subtracts it and decodes W 2 .\nOverﬂow region This corresponds to h > 1 −a 2 a 2 . As shown in Fig. 5, water-ﬁlling of user 1\u2019s power occurs as the power spills over from the λ-subband to the ¯λ-subband. The encoding scheme in the ¯ λ subband thus involves rate splitting for W 1 : a common message W 1c with power P 1c decoded by both receivers and a private message W 1p with power P 1A decoded only by receiver 1. Receiver 2 decodes W 1c ﬁrst, subtracts it, and decodes W 2 , all the while treating W 1p as noise.\nIt is remarkable that such a simple transmission scheme turns out to achieve precisely the same HK region with time sharing and with Gaussian input.\nthe non-na¨ıve FDM region, denoted by R FDM , is equivalent to R HK , whose boundary points can be characterized by the optimization problem [5, Eq. (151)]. It sufﬁces to verify the equivalence between R N and R FDM .\nWe start by considering water ﬁlling in the two-band FDM applied to the degraded GIC shown in Fig. 2(b). First, we split W 1 into private message W 1p with power constraint P 1p and common message W 1c with power constraint P 1c such that P 1p + P 1c = P 1 . Power allocation into λ and ¯λ subbands is done in the following order. First, P 1p is allocated to the two subbands in an arbitrary way. On top of that, P 2 is allocated to the two subbands via waterﬁlling. As Y 2 sees additional noise Z 2 , P 2 is allocated on top of Z 2 (see, e.g., Fig. 6(d)). Finally, P 1c is allocated to the two subbands, again, using waterﬁlling.\nDepending on P 1p and its allocation between the two subbands, there are four possible power allocation outcomes of this scheme, as shown in Fig. 6. Since the scenarios illustrated in Fig. 6(a)(b)(c) are equivalent to noiseberg cases, it remains to argue that the power allocation scheme with ﬂat spectrum top as in Fig. 6(d) is not optimal. This is because the achievable rates under such a scheme are formed by convex combinations of points on the curve of associated broadcast channel capacity, as the ﬂat top requires P 1c¯ λ ¯ λ = P 1cλ λ . As the broadcast channel capacity curve is convex, we can only achieve the points on the chord, which are dominated by the points on the curve corresponding to the scheme with no frequency division. Thus they are not optimal.\nNext we generalize this conclusion to three-band FDM. Similarly we argue that the power-bandwidth allocation schemes with two or more subbands sharing the same ﬂat top are not optimal. If two subbands are occupied solely by the transmission of X 1 , they can be merged into one and this reduces to one of the noiseberg scenarios.\nFor the MGICs with 0 < a ≤ 1, b ≥ 1 and ab ≥ 1, the HK region with Gaussian input can be simpliﬁed to be the set of all rate pairs (R\nwhere q ∈ N, i ∈ {1, . . . , q}, 0 ≤ α i ≤ 1, , ¯α i = 1 − α i , λ i ≥ 0, q\nλ i P 2i ≤ P 2 . We refer to R HK as the above HK region with Gaussian input. The difﬁculty in using this region is largely due to the presence of the time sharing variable.\nWe now describe a simple transmission scheme for a MGIC with ab ≥ 1. The scheme resembles the noiseberg scheme as it also utilizes the two-band non-na¨ıve FDM. Speciﬁcally, in the\nλ-subband, only transmitter 1 transmits and receiver 1 decodes W 1 with a rate constraint deﬁned in (4).\nIn the ¯ λ-subband, transmitter 2 does not use rate splitting. Transmitter 1, on the other hand, employs two encoding schemes depending on the value of h. The corresponding decoding schemes are also different. We describe them in details below.\nMultiplex region This corresponds to h ≤ 1 −a 2 a 2 . Sequential decoding is used at both receivers. Receiver 1 ﬁrst decodes W 2 , which leads to the constraint\nSubsequently, X 2 is subtracted from Y 1 and W 1 is decoded with constraint (2). Receiver 2 decodes W 2 with constraint (3). Comparing (3) and (5), we see that (5) is redundant. Therefore sequential decoding in the multiplex region achieves R N .\nOverﬂow region This corresponds to h > 1 −a 2 a 2 . Receiver 1 employs simultaneous decoding while receiver 2 still uses sequential decoding. For receiver 1, let S 1 , T 1 and T 2 be, respectively, the rates of transmitter 1\u2019s private message W 1p , common message W 1c and W 2 . Then R 1¯ λ = S 1 + T 1 and R\nAs receiver 2 decodes W 1C and W 2 sequentially, there will be two constraints\nwhere R 1¯ λ , R 2¯ λ and R 1λ satisfy (15)-(20) and (4). In the appendix we simplify this region and prove that it is equivalent to R N .\nCombining the results in both the multiplex and overﬂow regions, we conclude that R N is achievable for the MGICs with ab > 1. Thus we have,\nTheorem 2: For the MGICs with ab > 1, R N associated with the ZGIC obtained by removing the interfering link with gain b is achievable.\nProof: On the one hand, with Gaussian input, R HK of the MGIC is a subset of that of the ZGIC. On the other hand, R N ⊆ R HK for the MGIC in general. But Theorem 1 states that R N = R HK for the ZGIC. This establishes\nthe equivalence between R N and R HK for the MGICs with ab > 1.\nThis is consistent with [5, Theorem 12] that states for the MGICs with ab > 1, R HK is equivalent to that of the corresponding ZGIC.\nThis paper established the equivalence between Costa\u2019s noiseberg region and the HK region with Gaussian input for the ZGIC. For the MGICs with ab > 1, an achievable rate region was developed by rate splitting and a mixture of sequential and simultaneous decoding. By comparing the new region to the noiseberg region of the ZGIC, we proved that it is a simpliﬁcation of the HK region for the MGICs with ab > 1 and with Gaussian codebook.\nThe authors would like to thank Prof. Max Costa for helpful discussions about the noiseberg region.\nIn the appendix we prove the equivalence between the achievable rate region in the overﬂow region and R N .\nComparing this region with R N , we see that (16)(17) and (2)(3) are identical. Then it remains to show that (15)(18)-(20) are redundant given (16)(17).\nEq. (18) is redundant, since it is superseded by (16) and (17), i.e., we will show\nComparing (16)(17) and (19), we see that (19) being redun- dant is equivalent to\nwhich is equivalent to (22). Thus (19) is redundant. Comparing (16)(17) and (20), we see that (20) being redun- dant is equivalent to\nwhich are trivially true from (22) and (24). Thus (20) is redundant given (16) and (17)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A. B. Carleial"}],"title":{"text":"A case where interference does not reduce capacity"}},{"authors":[{"name":"H.
