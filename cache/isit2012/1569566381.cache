Three different compression methods are proposed: naive, joint and multiple description coding based. In naive CF (nCF) and joint CF (jCF), the relay forms a single representation, conveying its observation to both destinations at a single quality level. On the other hand, in multiple description coding based CF (mdCF), the relay utilizes multiple description coding and forms two representations, which allows for the two destinations to receive the relay observation at different quality levels. Through Gaussian examples, it is observed that mdCF enlarges nCF and jCF rate regions. Moreover, mdCF is the only scheme, which can achieve both of the single user CF rates achievable in the constituent single user relay channels."},"body":{"text":"The idea of increasing achievable rates in point-to-point channels by relaying dates back to [1]. The capacity of some classes of relay channels was studied and decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) schemes were proposed in [2]. Another building block in multiuser networks is the broadcast channel [3]. The capacity region for degraded broad- cast channels was established in [4] and superposition coding was proved to be the capacity achieving encoding scheme. Although superposition coding is optimal for degraded, less noisy or more capable broadcast channels, it is known to be suboptimal in general. Marton coding [5], on the other hand, gives the best known achievable rate region for the general broadcast channel.\nAs in point-to-point channels, relaying can enable signi- ﬁcant gains in the rate region of broadcast channels. The broadcast relay channel (BRC), which models the transmission between one source and two destinations with the aid of a dedicated relay, is ﬁrst studied in [6]. In [6], the authors ﬁnd an achievable scheme using Marton coding and DF relaying. A superposition coding and DF relaying based achievability scheme is proposed in [7]. This result is extended to the\nK-receiver case in [8]. The capacity region of a degraded Gaussian BRC, for which DF is optimal, is established in [9]. Another DF relaying based achievable scheme, which improves upon [6] is found in [10]. Finally, an outer bound on the capacity region of BRC is derived by jointly exploiting the ideas of outer bounds on the broadcast channel and the cut-set bound in [11].\nAs the above references suggest, all the achievability schemes for the BRC combine either superposition or Marton coding with DF relaying. However, DF relaying does not perform well, unless the relay can easily decode the source signal. In such cases, it is advantageous if the relay performs CF.\nAlthough there is not much attention in the BRC set-up, various types of CF relaying are used in other relay networks. The naive CF technique, which is a straightforward extension of simple CF [2], is used in the two-way relay channel setting in [12]. A successive reﬁnement based CF scheme is suggested for the two-way relay channel in [13]. The so- called generalized CF and nCF based achievability schemes are proposed for the interference relay channel in [14]. In [15], the authors extend the joint source-channel coding result of [16] to the multiple multicast single relay network. CF based achievable rates are also derived for simultaneous relay channels in [10]. In [17], noisy network coding is proposed for general multicast networks.\nNone of the above results are directly applicable to the BRC, in which a single source node broadcasts a different message to each destination. In this work, we investigate CF based achievability schemes for the BRC. We ﬁrst study naive CF (nCF), in which the relay forms a single representation and uses Wyner-Ziv binning to send the compressed signal to both destinations. Secondly, we investigate joint CF (jCF). Similar to nCF, jCF generates a single compression, but avoids Wyner- Ziv binning. Finally, we propose using multiple description coding based CF (mdCF) at the relay. Multiple description coding is a source coding technique, in which a source is encoded into multiple representations at different levels of\nquality [18]. In mdCF scheme we suggest, unlike nCF or jCF, the relay constructs two descriptions of its observa- tion instead of just one. The relay then uses superposition coding to convey these descriptions to the destinations. The source can broadcast its messages using either superposition or Marton coding. We compare our results with nCF and jCF techniques and show that the relay does not need to adjust the compression rate according to the worse relay- destination link, or the worse available side information at the destinations, but can send its observation at different quality levels to the destinations. In [13], an alternative solution is proposed from a successive reﬁnement coding perspective. However, in successive reﬁnement coding based approach, both destinations should reconstruct the coarser description, which leads to a different tradeoff between the ﬁdelity levels of two descriptions. In mdCF, we tailor each description to its own destination individually.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: Section II describes the system model for the BRC. Section III presents the new achievable rate regions, Section IV extends the achievability schemes to Gaussian channels and Section V concludes the paper.\nWe consider a discrete memoryless broadcast relay channel ( X × X r , p(y r , y 1 , y 2 |x, x r ), Y r × Y 1 × Y 2 ), which consists of a transmitter with channel input x ∈ X , a dedicated relay with relay input x r ∈ X r and relay output y r ∈ Y r , two receivers with channel outputs y 1 ∈ Y 1 and y 2 ∈ Y 2 , and a channel probability transition function p(y r , y 1 , y 2 |x, x r ). As the BRC is memoryless, the joint probability mass function\nIn the BRC, the source sends two private messages M 1 and M 2 to destinations 1 and 2, respectively as shown in Fig.1.\nDeﬁnition 1: A (2 nR 1 , 2 nR 2 , n) code for a BRC con- sists of two message sets M 1 =\nwhich assigns a codeword x(M 1 , M 2 ) to each message pair (M 1 , M 2 ) ∈ (M 1 , M 2 ), a set of relay functions {f i } n i=1 : x r,i = f (Y r,1 , Y r,2 , ..., Y r,i −1 ), and two decoders {g k : Y n k → M k } k=1,2 , which map the received sequence y n k to a message\nDeﬁnition 2: Assuming the transmitted message (M 1 , M 2 ) is uniformly distributed over ( M 1 × M 2 ), the average prob- ability of error for a (2 nR 1 , 2 nR 2 , n) code is deﬁned as:\nThe rate tuple (R 1 , R 2 ) is said to be achievable for the broadcast relay channel if there exists a sequence of (2 nR 1 , 2 nR 2 , n) codes with P (n) e → 0 as n → ∞.\nIn this section, we propose ﬁve new achievable schemes for the BRC. In the ﬁrst and second schemes, the source respectively uses Marton coding and superposition coding. In both cases the relay does Wyner-Ziv binning on the single representation it forms, which is reconstructed at both desti- nations. We call this type of compression naive. In the third scheme called jCF, the relay adopts the source coding idea of [16] and does not perform any binning on the compressed signal. The source does superposition coding. In the fourth and ﬁfth schemes the source respectively employs Marton and superposition coding. In both cases the relay compresses its observation into two different representations using multiple description coding and forwards them to the destinations using superposition coding. In the following, we will omit all the proofs due to space limitations.\nTheorem 1: For the discrete memoryless BRC, the rate pair (R nCF 1 , R nCF 2 ) is achievable, where\nR nCF 1 ≤ I(U 1 ; ˆ Y r , Y 1 |X r ) \t (1a) R nCF 2 ≤ I(U 2 ; ˆ Y r , Y 2 |X r ) \t (1b)\nfor some joint distribution of the form p(u 1 , u 2 )p(x |u 1 , u 2 ) p(x r )p(y r , y 1 , y 2 |x, x r )p(ˆ y r |x r , y r ).\nTo achieve this rate pair, the source uses Marton coding, and the relay does naive CF. In naive CF, the relay compresses its observation in Wyner-Ziv fashion to form only one description. The maximization in (2) indicates that the compression rate must be adjusted to the worse side information, either y 1 or y 2 ; and the minimization in (2) implies that the compressed signal ˆ y r must be reliably decoded at both destinations. To enable cooperation among the source and the relay, a block Markov coding structure is used, and the encoding is carried over B blocks. Decoding is backwards at both destinations. In each block, the destinations ﬁrst decode the relay signal x r , treating the source signal x as noise. Then they obtain ˆ y r . Combining ˆ y r with y k , k = 1, 2, each destination decodes their respective messages M 1 and M 2 .\nTheorem 2: For the discrete memoryless BRC, the rate pair ( ¯ R nCF 1 , ¯ R nCF 2 ) is achievable, where\nfor some joint distribution of the form p(u)p(x |u)p(x r ) p(y r , y 1 , y 2 |x, x r )p(ˆ y r |x r , y r ).\nTo achieve the above ( ¯ R nCF 1 , ¯ R nCF 2 ) pair, the source uses superposition coding and the relay does nCF. Similar to Theorem 1, block Markov coding over B blocks and backward decoding is used. Decoding x r and ˆ y r , both destinations recover u and thus M 2 . The ﬁrst destination then recovers M 1 . Note that, switching the order of superposition at the source is also possible and can increase the achievable rates.\nThe strict constraint on the compression rate posed by nCF relaying can be loosened if an advanced compression technique [16], is used. In the following theorem, we present the rates achievable with jCF in the BRC.\nTheorem 3: The rate pair (R jCF 1 , R jCF 2 ) is achievable in a discrete memoryless BRC where\nR jCF 1 ≤ I(X; ˆ Y r , Y 1 |U, X r ) \t (5a) R jCF 2 ≤ min{I(U; ˆ Y r , Y 1 |X r ), I(U ; ˆ Y r , Y 2 |X r ) } \t (5b)\nI(Y r ; ˆ Y r |X r , Y 1 ) ≤ I(X r ; Y 1 ) \t (6a) I(Y r ; ˆ Y r |X r , Y 2 ) ≤ I(X r ; Y 2 ) \t (6b)\nfor some joint distribution of the form p(u)p(x |u)p(x r ) p(y r , y 1 , y 2 |x, x r )p(ˆ y r |x r , y r ).\nTo achieve this rate pair, the source uses superposition coding, and the relay does jCF over B blocks. The destinations employ backward decoding. Note that, switching the order of superposition is also possible and can increase the achievable rates.\nSimilar to nCF, in jCF, the relay compresses its observation according to the side informations available at the destinations. However, unlike nCF, there is no explicit binning operation. In jCF, each destination forms a list of possible compressed versions. The length of each user\u2019s list depends on its relay- destination link quality. Destinations further resolve the un- certainty in the list by using their own side informations. Although the constraint on the compression rate is relaxed with respect to nCF, the relay should still choose a compression rate which ensures that both destinations can resolve the uncertainty in their lists. Therefore, jCF is also limited by the fact that there is a single representation. However, if multiple description coding is used at the relay, the relay can send two different descriptions at two different distortions. This will enable an improved system with more degrees of freedom. In\nthe next two theorems, we present the rate pairs achievable with mdCF.\nTheorem 4: For the discrete memoryless BRC, the rate pair (R mdCF 1 \t , R mdCF 2 \t ) is achievable, where\nR mdCF 1 \t ≤ I(U 1 ; ˆ Y 1 , Y 1 |V, X r ) \t (7a) R mdCF 2 \t ≤ I(U 2 ; ˆ Y 2 , Y 2 |V ) \t (7b)\nR mdCF 1 \t + R mdCF 2 \t ≤ I(U 1 ; ˆ Y 1 , Y 1 |V, X r ) + I(U 2 ; ˆ Y 2 , Y 2 |V ) −I(U 1 ; U 2 ) \t (7c)\nI(Y r ; ˆ Y 1 |V, X r , Y 1 ) ≤ I(X r ; Y 1 |V ) \t (8a) I(Y r ; ˆ Y 2 |V, Y 2 ) ≤ min{I(V ; Y 1 ), I(V ; Y 2 ) } (8b)\nfor some joint distribution of the form p(u 1 , u 2 )p(x |u 1 , u 2 ) p(v)p(x r |v)p(y r , y 1 , y 2 |x, x r )p(ˆ y 1 |v, x r , y r )p(ˆ y 2 |v, y r ).\nTo achieve this rate pair, the source uses Marton coding; and the relay does multiple description coding based compression. The relay then sends these two descriptions to the destinations using superposition coding. As in the previous achievability schemes, a block Markov coding structure is used, and the encoding is carried over B blocks. Backward decoding is used at both destinations. Note that, instead of transmitting ˆ y 2 at the base layer, the relay can send ˆ y 1 at the base layer. If this is case, the subscripts 1 and 2 in (7) and (8) must be interchanged.\nTheorem 5: For the discrete memoryless BRC, the rate pair ( ¯ R mdCF 1 \t , ¯ R mdCF 2 \t ) is achievable, where\n≤ I(X; ˆ Y 1 , Y 1 |U, V, X r ) \t (9a) ¯ R mdCF 2 \t ≤ min{I(U; ˆ Y 1 , Y 1 |V, X r ), I(U ; ˆ Y 2 , Y 2 |V )}(9b)\nI(Y r ; ˆ Y 1 |V, X r , Y 1 ) ≤ I(X r ; Y 1 |V ) \t (10a) I(Y r ; ˆ Y 2 |V, Y 2 ) ≤ min{I(V ; Y 1 ), I(V ; Y 2 ) }.(10b)\nSwitching the superposition order at the source, the rate pair ( ˜ R mdCF 1 \t , ˜ R mdCF 2 \t ) is also achievable, where\nI(Y r ; ˆ Y 1 |V, X r , Y 1 ) ≤ I(X r ; Y 1 |V ) \t (12a) I(Y r ; ˆ Y 2 |V, Y 2 ) ≤ min{I(V ; Y 1 ), I(V ; Y 2 ) }(12b)\nfor some joint distribution of the form p(u)p(x |u)p(v)p(x r |v) p(y r , y 1 , y 2 |x, x r )p(ˆ y 1 |v, x r , y r )p(ˆ y 2 |v, y r ).\nTo achieve this rate pair, the source and the relay both use superposition coding, and the relay does mdCF. As in the previous theorems, a block Markov coding structure is used, and the encoding is carried over B blocks. Decoding is backwards at both destinations.\nTo attain the rate pair ( ¯ R mdCF 1 \t , ¯ R mdCF 2 \t ), the source and the relay respectively transmit M 2 and ˆ y 2 at the base layer. However, it is important to note that the order of superposition\nat the source and the relay need not be the same. For example, to attain the rate pair ( ˜ R mdCF 1 \t , ˜ R mdCF 2 \t ), the source inverses its superposition order and sends M 1 at the base layer, while the relay keeps the superposition order the same. It is possible to improve the achievable rates further, if the other two cases, in which 1) the source sends M 1 and the relay transmits ˆ y 1 at the base layer, and 2) the source sends M 2 and the relay transmits ˆ y 1 at the base layer, are also considered.\nIn this section, we investigate the Gaussian BRC. The input- output relationships for the additive white Gaussian noise channel are deﬁned as follows:\nY r = h r X + Z r \t (13a) Y i = h i X + h ri X r + Z i , for i = 1, 2. \t (13b)\nThe Gaussian noises at the relay and at the ith destination are i.i.d with zero-mean and variances N r and N i , respectively. h r , h i and h ri are the corresponding channel gains of source- relay, source-ith destination and relay-ith destination links. The source and the relay power constraints are E {X 2 } = P and E {X 2 r } = P r .\nWe ﬁrst consider nCF and jCF schemes, in which only a single representation of Y r is formed at the relay. Let the compressed version of the relay\u2019s observation is deﬁned as ˆ Y r = Y r + ˆ Z r , where the compression noise ˆ Z r is modeled as an independent Gaussian noise with zero-mean and variance\nˆ N Q r , Q ∈ {nCF, jCF }. Then, for successful transmission of the compressed signal to both users,\nmust be satisﬁed, where the maximization is carried over S nCF = {(i, j) : i ∈ {1, 2}, j ∈ {1, 2}} for nCF and over S jCF = {(i, j) : i = j, i ∈ {1, 2}, j ∈ {1, 2}} for jCF. Then the achievable rate pair of Theorems 2 and 3 for the particular superposition order stated in (3) and (5) becomes\n1 2\nUnlike nCF or jCF, in mdCF, the relay forms two different representations for its observation Y r . They are deﬁned as ˆ Y i = Y r + ˆ Z i with ˆ Z i ⊥ Y r where ˆ Z i ∼ N (0, ˆ N i ), i = 1, 2. As we have discussed earlier, the source and the relay can use four different superposition orders in total, which lead to different ˆ N 1 and ˆ N 2 and different rate pairs. For the particular superposition order assumed in (10), the compression noise variances must satisfy\nwhere ˜ N i = h 2 ri ¯ βP r + N i . Then, the corresponding achievable rate pair of (9) is found as\nwhere f N (1) = N 1 and f N (2) = ˜ N 2 . If the source and the relay respectively allocate all available power to M 1 and ˆ Y 1 (α = 0, β = 0) then ¯ R mdCF 2 \t = 0 and (19) becomes\nwhich is equal to the relay channel CF rate for the ﬁrst destination in the absence of the second destination. Similarly, setting α = 1 and β = 1 and choosing an appropriate superposition order, mdCF achieves the relay channel CF rate for the second destination, while the ﬁrst destination has rate 0.\nFor the numerical results, we investigate our achievabil- ity schemes for two scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario, h r = 1.25, h 1 = 0.64, h 2 = 1.00, h r1 = 1.75 and h r2 = 50. This is the case, where the relay is very close to the second destination but not so close to the ﬁrst destination. In the second scenario, the channel gains are h r = 1, h 1 = 1, h 2 = 8, h r1 = 4, h r2 = 4. The second scenario corresponds to the case, where the relay is close to the both destinations and the second destination has a strong direct link. In both scenarios, the source and the relay transmit powers are P = P r = 10 dB and the noise variances are N r = N 1 = N 2 = 0 dB.\nIn Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, we plot the rate regions achievable with nCF (Theorem 2), jCF (Theorem 3), mdCF (Theorem 5) and DF [9]. Although the theorem statements are given for only one superposition order, here we plot the convex hull of all possible superposition orders for all schemes, which is also achievable via time sharing. We also plot four points on the ﬁgures: the relay channel CF rates and relay channel cut-set bounds. The relay channel CF rates indicate the rates achievable with CF [2] at ith destination, i = 1, 2, if the other destination did not exist in the system. Similarly, the relay channel cut-set bounds [19] indicate an upper bound on rates achievable at ith destination, i = 1, 2, assuming the other destination is not present.\nIn Fig. 2, we observe that nCF and jCF result in the same rate region as for certain relations between channel gains\nˆ N nCF r \t = ˆ N jCF r \t and nCF and jCF result in the same rate region. The mdCF scheme improves upon these schemes and achieves a larger rate region. However, in this ﬁrst scenario, as h r and h 1 are comparable, CF based schemes are not favorable from the ﬁrst destination\u2019s perspective and DF achieves larger rates. Yet, it is interesting to observe that mdCF is the only scheme, which achieves the relay channel CF rates for both destinations. Fig. 2 also suggests that a combination of DF and\nCF schemes can be especially useful in networks with multiple receivers. Similar to Fig. 2, in Fig. 3, we observe that mdCF is the only scheme, which connects the two relay channel CF rate points. As nCF and jCF form only one representation for the relay\u2019s observation, they are unable to create a balance between relay channel CF rates for each destination. Note that the mdCF proposed in this paper is separation based, i.e. it ﬁrst requires the relay signal (V and/or X r ) and then the related representation ( ˆ Y 1 and ˆ Y 2 ) to be decoded at the corresponding receivers. However this condition can be relaxed if the joint coding scheme of [16] is employed, leading into a larger mdCF based rate region then the shown in Fig. 3.\nIn this work the four terminal broadcast relay channel with one source, two destinations and a dedicated relay node is studied for both discrete memoryless channels and Gaussian channels. Three types of CF based achievability schemes are presented. In naive CF and joint CF, there is a single com- pressed signal, which has to be decoded at both destinations. This limits the compression quality to be adjusted to the worse relay-destination link and/or the worse side information. On the other hand, in multiple-description coding based CF, the relay produces two different representations at two different ﬁdelity levels, which are then broadcast to the two destinations. It is observed that multiple description based CF improves upon both naive CF and joint CF, and is the only scheme that merges the relay channel CF rates; i.e. the rates achievable with CF at each destination, assuming the other destination is not present. The new achievability schemes also improve upon DF based relaying schemes, especially when the decoding requirement at the relay is too restrictive. Future work includes studying advanced joint-source channel coding schemes at the relay."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"E.
