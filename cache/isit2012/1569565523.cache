However, not much is known about the weight distributions of these codes except in very speciﬁc cases. Especially, for an odd prime p, the value distribution of the exponential sum and the weight distribution of the relevant cyclic code are derived [3],[4]. Recently, the value distribution of the exponential sum for d = (p n +1)/(p+ 1) + (p n − 1)/2, odd prime p such that p ≡ 3 mod 4, and odd n is derived in [5].\nIn this paper, the value distribution of the exponential sum is calculated for d = (p n + 1)/(p k + 1) + (p n − 1)/2 with k|n, an odd prime p such that p ≡ 3 mod 4, and odd n, which contains the result of [5] as a special case. Deploying the result, the weight distribution of the relevant cyclic code C is also derived.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, some preliminaries and notations are stated. In Section III, the value distribution of the exponential sum is derived. In Section IV, the weight distribution of the relevant cyclic code C is calculated. In Section V, we conclude the paper.\nA. Exponential Sum and the Hamming Weight of the Code C Let p be a prime and F p n the ﬁnite ﬁeld with p n elements.\nwhere x ∈ F p n and m|n. Let α be a primitive element of F p n and F ∗ p n = F p n \\ {0}.\nwhen a and b run through F p n is considered, where ω is a primitive p-th root of unity and χ(·) = ω tr n 1 (·) is a canonical multiplicative character of F p n .\nLet C be the cyclic code over F p with the length L = p n −1 in which each codeword is deﬁned as\nwhere c i = tr n 1 (aα i + bα di ), 0 ≤ i ≤ L − 1. The Hamming weight of the codeword c(a, b) is given as\nWe deﬁne a quadratic form in k variables over F p s as a homogeneous polynomial in F p s [x 1 , . . . , x k ]\nwhere p is an odd prime and a ij = a ji ∈ F p s . We then associate f with the k × k symmetric matrix A whose (i, j) entry is a ij . The matrix A is called the coefﬁcient matrix of f and r denotes the rank of A. Then, there exists a nonsingular k × k matrix B over F p s such that C = BAB T is a diagonal matrix and C = diag(c 1 , . . . , c r , 0, · · · , 0), where c i ∈ F ∗ p s . Let ∆ = c 1 · · · c r and η be the quadratic character of F p s , which will be used in the following lemmas. A quadratic form f (x) in k variables over F p s can be regarded as a mapping f (x) from F p sk to F p s when x i ∈ F p s . Thus, we will also use the term \u2018quadratic form\u2019 for this mapping f (x) in F p sk .\nwhere a i ∈ F ∗ p n and s is a great common divisor of n and all nonzero i\u2019s. Then\nLemma 2 (Luo and Feng [3]): The rank r of the quadratic form f (x) from F p sk to F p s can be determined from the num- ber of elements that the form is independent of, i.e., (p s ) k−r is the number of y ∈ F p sk such that f (x + y) − f (x) − f (y) = 0 for all x ∈ F p sk .\nLemma 3 (Luo and Feng [3]): Let f (x) be a mapping from F p sk to F p s corresponding to a quadratic form f (x) ∈ F p s [x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x k ] of rank r with ∆. Then we have\ns ) k− r 2 , \t if p s ≡ 1 mod 4 j r η(∆)(p s ) k− r 2 , if p s ≡ 3 mod 4\nIn this paper, the value distribution of the exponential sum S(a, b) when a and b run through F p n is considered. Here are some parameters used in the remainder of this paper:\n\u2022 p is an odd prime such that p ≡ 3 mod 4; \u2022 n is an odd integer;\nWhen either a or b is equal to zero, S(a, b) is given as the following lemma.\nLemma 4: When either a or b is equal to zero, S(a, b) is determined as\n  \nNote that gcd(p k + 1, p n − 1) = 2 and −1 is a nonsquare in F p n . Then, for a, b ∈ F ∗ p n , S(a, b) can be transformed into the exponential sums of the quadratic forms as\nχ(−ax p k +1 + bx 2 ). From Lemma 1, it is easily veriﬁed that both\nare quadratic forms over F p k . Thus, from Lemma 3, we are able to calculate the exponential sums S 1 (a, b) and S 2 (a, b). From Lemma 2, in order to derive the rank of the quadratic form Q 1 (x), we need to calculate the number of solutions x ∈ F p n satisfying\nQ 1 (x + y) − Q 1 (x) − Q 1 (y) = 0, for all y ∈ F p n ⇔ φ a,b (x) = a p k x p 2k + 2b p k x p k + ax = 0.\nSince the polynomial φ a,b (x) is a linearized polynomial over F p n , it is easily checked that the number of roots x ∈ F p n\nis 1, p k , or p 2k . From Lemma 2, Q 1 (x) can have the rank e, e − 1, or e − 2, where e = n/k. Similarly, the corresponding linearized polynomial of Q 2 (x) is given as φ −a,b (x) and the possible rank of Q 2 (x) is also e, e − 1, or e − 2.\nFrom Lemma 3, it is easily checked that each exponential sum of S 1 (a, b) and S 2 (a, b) has the values\n  \n \n± p k p n 2 , for r = e − 1 ±jp k p n 2 , \t for r = e − 2\nwhere r denotes the rank of the corresponding quadratic form. From the two techniques in [5], some exponential sum\nvalues which actually do not occur can be ruled out for explicit evaluation as the following lemmas.\nLemma 5: At least one of φ a,b (x) and φ −a,b (x) has a single root in F p n , i.e., one of the two quadratic forms Q 1 (x) and Q 2 (x) must have the rank e.\nLemma 6 (Theorem 5.38 [6]): Let f (x) ∈ F p n [x] be a polynomial of degree l ≥ 1 with gcd(l, p n ) = 1 and let χ be a nontrivial additive character of F p n . Then\nIn [5], they used the wise method to exclude some expo- nential sum values which do not occur by using Weil\u2019s bound in Lemma 6. Similarly, the following lemma can be derived.\nLemma 7: The two candidate values of S(a, b), ±j(p k − 1)/2p n/2 , do not actually occur when a and b run through\nTheorem 8: The exponential sum S(a, b) for a, b ∈ F p n has the following candidate values\nSo far, it is derived that the exponential sum S(a, b) can have the ten candidate values as in Theorem 8. Let v i , 0 ≤ i ≤ 9, be the i-th value in (4) through the given order. Let Ω i , 0 ≤ i ≤ 9, be the number of occurrences of v i when a and b run through F p n . Note that each conjugate pair has the same number of occurrences. Hence we need ﬁve independent equations in terms of Ω i to determine the distribution. It is easy to derive the following three equations\nFrom the results in [7], the distribution of the ranks of the quadratic forms Q 1 (x) and Q 2 (x) when a and b run through F ∗ p n can be derived. Hence the remaining two equations in terms of Ω i \u2019s can be obtained from the rank distribution.\nFrom the above lemma, the following lemma is derived. Lemma 9: We have\nFrom the derived ﬁve equations (5)\u2013(9), each value of Ω i is determined as in the following theorem.\nTheorem 10: The value distribution of the exponential sum S(a, b) when a and b run through F p n is given as\n           \n          \nLet C is the cyclic code over F p with length L = p n − 1 in which each codeword is deﬁned as\nwhere c i = tr n 1 (aα i + bα di ), 0 ≤ i ≤ L − 1. The Hamming weight of the codeword c(a, b) is given as\nH w (c(a, b)) = L − 1 p\nwhere µ(S(a, b)) = p−1 j=1 S(ja, jb). Hence the Hamming weight of the codeword c(a, b) is determined by calculating µ(S(a, b)). Let {w 0 , w 1 , . . . , w L } be the weight distribution of C, where w i is the number of occurrences of the codewords c(a, b) of Hamming weight i, 0 ≤ i ≤ L, when a and b run through F p n . The following lemma is used for the calculation of µ(S(a, b)).\nLemma 11 (Lemma 4 in [2]): Let ω be a primitive p-th root of unity and ( · p ) the Legendre symbol. The Galois group of Q(ω) over Q is {σ i |1 ≤ i ≤ p−1} where the automorphism σ i of Q(ω) is determined by σ i (ω) = ω i . The unique\nquadratic subﬁeld of Q(ω) is Q( √ p ∗ ), where p ∗ = ( −1 p )p and σ i (\nTheorem 12: The weight distribution {w 0 , w 1 , . . . , w L } of the cyclic code C over F p with the length L = p n − 1 and the dimension dim F p C = 2n is given as\n         \n        \n(p n − 1)(p n − 2p n−k + 1), when i = p n−1 (p − 1) (p n − 1)(p n−k − p n−k 2 ),\nwhen i = (p − 1)(p n−1 + 1 2 p n+k 2 −1 ) (p n − 1)(p n−k + p n−k 2 ),\nIn this paper, the value distribution of the exponential sum S(a, b) when a and b run through F p n and the weight distribution of the relevant cyclic code C over F p with the length L = p n − 1 and the dimension dim F p C = 2n are derived for an odd prime p such that p ≡ 3 mod 4, d = (p n + 1)/(p k + 1) + (p n − 1)/2 with k|n, and odd n.
