In this paper, we make an attempt to shed some insight into this erratic behavior of R n , by drawing an analogy with the realm of physics of wave propagation, in particular, the elementary theory of scattering and diffraction. It turns out that there are two types of behavior of wave diffraction patterns formed by crystals, which are correspondingly analogous to the two types of patterns of R n . When the crystal is perfect, the diffraction intensity spectrum exhibits very sharp peaks, a.k.a. Bragg peaks, at wavelengths of full constructive interference. These wavelengths correspond to the frequencies of the harmonic waves of the oscillatory mode of R n . On the other hand, when the crystal is imperfect and there is a considerable degree of disorder in its structure, the Bragg peaks disappear, and the behavior of this mode is analogous to the one where R n is convergent."},"body":{"text":"The analysis of the average redundancy of lossless codes for data compression schemes is a topic that at- tracted the attention of considerably many researchers throughout the history of Information Theory (cf. e.g., [1],[3],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[13] and many references therein).\nIn [13] Szpankowski has derived the asymptotic behavior of the average redundancy R n , as a function of the block length n, for the Shannon code, the Huffman code, and other codes, focusing primarily on the binary memoryless source, parametrized by p \u2013 the probability of zero. His analysis revealed a rather interesting behavior of R n , especially in the cases of the Shannon code and the Huffman code: When α ∆ = log 2 [(1 − p)/p] is irrational, then R n converges to a constant (which is 1/2 for the Shannon code and 3/2 − 1/ ln 2 for the Huffman code) as n → ∞. On the other hand, when α is rational, R n has a non\u2013vanishing oscillatory term of the form βm 0 n , where β ∆ = − log 2 (1 − p), m 0 is the denominator of α = 0 /m 0 in its representation as the ratio between two integers whose greatest common divisor is 1, and\nx. In several places in his paper, Szpankowski describes this behavior of R n as \u201cerratic\u201d and this qualiﬁer is, of course, understandable.\nOur purpose in this paper is to make an attempt to give some insight into this erratic behavior of R n by drawing an analogy with the physics of wave diffraction. From the theory of X\u2013ray scattering (see, e.g., [2, Chapter 2],[14]), it is known that if the object that causes the diffraction of an incident wave is a perfect crystal, then the intensity proﬁle of the scattered wave (as a function of the wavelength or the wave number) exhibits very sharp peaks, known as Bragg peaks, at wavelengths that correspond to full coherence, where the optical distance differences to all scattering elements (layers of the crystal) are exactly integer multiples of the wavelength. This continues to be the case as long as there is enough order in the medium such that all these distances are commensurable and therefore have a common divisor (common unit of length), which can serve as the fundamental wavelength. In the realm of the average redundancy analysis, this corresponds to the case where α is rational and the fundamental frequency of the oscillatory term βm 0 n of R n is intimately related to the fundamental wavelength at which there is a Bragg peak. On the other hand, when the distances are incommensurable, perfect coherence between all scattered waves is not achieved at any wavelength and therefore no Bragg peaks are observed. This is the case of strong disorder, which in the lossless source coding problem, corresponds to the case of α irrational, where R n is convergent.\nMore concretely, the analysis of the scattered wave intensity function is based on a very simple model of disorder, which is due to Hendricks and Teller [5] (see also [4]). According to the Hendricks\u2013Teller (HT) model, the distances between every two consecutive layers in the solid are selected independently at random from a ﬁnite set of two or more distances. In the simplest case, where there are only two possible distances d 0 and d 1 , with probabilities p and 1 − p, this random selection process is analogous to the memoryless binary source of the data compression problem and the parameter α of this source plays a role analogous to that of the ratio d 1 /d 0 . Thus, α irrational means that d 0 and d 1 are incommensurable, which\nis the case of strong disorder with no Bragg peaks and no oscillations in R n . On the other hand when α = d 1 /d 0 is rational, we are in the (partially) ordered mode, as described above.\nFrom the pure mathematical point of view, the analogy between the average redundancy problem and the diffrac- tion problem is rooted in that at the heart of the analyzes of both problems, there is one very simple mathematical fact in common: Given a vector (p 0 , p 1 , . . . , p M −1 ) of non\u2013 negative reals summing to unity (probabilities) and a vector (α 1 , . . . , α M −1 ) ∈ IR M −1 , the complex number\nhas a modulus that obviously never exceeds unity, and C m = 1 (i.e., full coherence between all M phasors) is attained for some integer values of m if and only if {α j } are all rational. To see why this true, ﬁrst observe that the \u201cif\u201d part is obvious: If {α j } are all rational, namely, α j = k j /n j , j = 1, . . . , M − 1, for some positive integers {k j } and {n j } (where k j and n j are relatively prime for all j), let m 0 be their common denominator, i.e., the smallest common multiple of all {n j }. Then clearly, C m = 1 for all values of m which are integer multiples of m 0 , since mα j is integer for all 1 ≤ j ≤ M − 1 at the same time. 1 The \u201conly if\u201d part follows from the simple fact that for C m to be equal to 1, m j ∆ = mα j must be integers for all 1 ≤ j ≤ M − 1. In other words, α j = m j /m, which means that {α j } must all be rational. The analogy between the Shannon code redundancy analysis and the diffraction patterns under the HT model will center around (1) and its two types of behavior depending on the rationality or irrationality of {α j }.\nThe remaining part of this short paper consists of two more main sections. To gain some insight concerning the derivations in [13], we present them in a somewhat sketchy way, emphasizing the use of the simple mathematical fact described in the previous paragraph. For reasons of simplicity, we focus on the Shannon code and the derivation specializes on the memoryless case. In Section 3, we bring the derivation of the diffraction patterns of the HT model, with a focus on the analogy with Section 2. We then describe in detail the mapping between the two problems under discussion. Finally, in Section 4 we summarize and conclude, with a few speculations on a possible extension to the Markov case.\nThroughout the remaining part of this paper, we use capital letters to designate random variables (e.g., X i ) and the corre- sponding lower case letters to denote speciﬁc realizations (e.g., x i ). Consider a ﬁnite alphabet memoryless source X 1 , X 2 , . . . with alphabet X = {0, 1, 2, . . . , M − 1} and symbol probabil- ities {p 0 , p 1 , . . . , p M −1 }. We shall assume that the source is not dydic, i.e., the probabilities {p i } are not all integer powers of 1/2, as in the dyadic case, R n ≡ 0, which is uninteresting,\nand the results in [13] do not apply. We also assume, without loss of generality, that p 0 is the largest letter probability, so that the parameters α j ∆ = log(p 0 /p j ), j = 1, . . . , M − 1 are all non\u2013negative.\nThe Shannon code for lossless data compression assigns to every source n\u2013tuple x = (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ) ∈ X n a binary codeword of length\nwhere u designates the smallest integer not smaller than u. The average redundancy of the Shannon code is deﬁned as\nis the per\u2013symbol entropy. In [13], the asymptotic behavior of R n is derived for the binary alphabet case. The extension to the M \u2013ary alphabet case considered here (and which is mentioned brieﬂy in [13]) is straightforward, and it is given by:\n(5) where β ∆ = − log β 0 and m 0 is the smallest common multiple of all denominators of (rational) {α i } when presented as ratios between two relatively prime integers.\nHaving the asymptotic expressions of R n as in (5), already being derived in [13] in a completely rigorous manner, it is now instructive to present these derivations in another, somewhat sketchy way, 2 which is considerably simpler than in [13], but still captures the essence behind the main underlying ideas. We believe that this may help to gain, ﬁrst of all, some intuitive insight concerning these expressions, and then to understand also their analogy to the derivations in the wave diffraction problem.\nBy using the Fourier series expansion of the function 3 (u) ∆ = u − u, according to\n \n1 2\n \nHaving deﬁned α j = log(p 0 /p j ), j = 1, 2, . . . , M − 1, the expression in the square brackets is exactly C m as was deﬁned in (1). The behavior of R n for large n is then as follows. If {α j } are not all rational, then |C m | < 1 for all m, and so, lim n→∞ C n m = 0, which causes the entire summation over m to vanish for large n. 4 In this case, R n → 1/2 as n → ∞. On the other hand, if {α j } are all rational, then there exists an integer m such that mα j are all integers. Having denoted by m 0 the smallest positive integer with this property, it is clear that all other integers with the same property are integer multiples of m 0 . Consequently, lim n→∞ C n m = 1 whenever m is an integer multiple of m 0 and lim n→∞ C n m = 0 otherwise. Thus, having deﬁned β = − log p 0 , we now have for large n, 5\n= 1 2\n1 2\nwhere the second line holds since a m is inversely proportional to m (see (6) above) and in the third line we used the fact that right\u2013hand side of (6) is also the Fourier series expansion of\nthe function (1 − u ) (see footnote no. 3) with u = βm 0 n. As can easily be seen from the second line of (8), for large n, the sequence R n is harmonic with a fundamental frequency ω 0 = 2πm 0 β. In other words, the Fourier transform of {R n } contains Dirac delta functions at integer multiples of ω 0 (modulo 2π). We will see later on that these spectral spikes are analogous to the Bragg peaks of the HT model.\nAt this point, a technical comment is in order. At ﬁrst glance, it may seem that the above approximate expression of R n is asymmetric with respect to permutations of the alphabet, because β was deﬁned as − log p 0 and the choice of the symbol x = 0 as having a special role in the last line of (7) was completely arbitrary (we could have chosen, of course, any other symbol j as well). However, note that\nβm 0 n = −m 0 n log p 0 is identical to −m 0 n log p j for all j = 1, . . . , M − 1 because in the rational case considered above, the numbers {−m 0 n log p j } M −1 j=0 differ from each other by integers, and therefore their fractional parts are all the same. Thus, the above expression of R n is, in fact, invariant to permutations of the alphabet.\nThe simplest way to think of the HT model is as a one\u2013 dimensional model of an alloy, which is characterized by a sequence of mass points, positioned along the real line at random locations Z 0 , Z 1 , . . . , Z n−1 . The ensemble of the HT model is deﬁned in terms of the spacings ∆ j ∆ = Z j − Z j−1 , j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, which are (n − 1) i.i.d. random variables taking on values in a ﬁnite set {d 0 , d 1 , . . . , d M −1 } with probabilities p 0 , p 1 , . . . , p M −1 , respectively (thus, Z 0 , Z 1 , . . . is a random walk). Each point Z i contributes a scattered wave described by the phasor e −iqZ j , where in the one\u2013dimensional setting considered here, q can be understood as the wave number, that is, q = 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength. Assuming the same amplitudes at all points, the superposition of all these contributions is then the sum U (q) = j e −iqZ j , which can be interpreted as the Fourier transform of the function u(z) = j δ(z − Z j ). The overall intensity of this superposition of waves is designated by the structure function [2, Chapter 2]\n \n \n =\nwhere the expectation is with respect to the random variables {Z j }.\nThe derivation of I(q) is fairly simple (see, e.g., [4]) and it is brought here for the sake of completeness.\nwhere I 0 (q) is deﬁned as the second term of the third line and I ∗ 0 (q) is the complex conjugate of I 0 (q). Now,\nFor n large, whenever |C(q)| < 1, the last expression is dominated by the term n ∞ r=1 [C(q)] r = nC(q)/[1 − C(q)], which together with the two other terms of (10), yields\n|1 − C(q)| 2 , \t (13) or equivalently,\n|1 − C(q)| 2 . \t (14) If there are values of q for which |C(q)| = 1, yet C(q) = 1, then the geometric series diverges at these points, but these are only points of removable discontinuity in ˆ I(q) because for every other point, arbitrarily close to such a discontinuity point, again |C(q)| < 1, and the geometric series converges. The real problematic points, if any, are those where C(q) = 1 if they exist. For C(q) = 1, we have to re-derive the expression of I(q) separately, which is very simple as I(q) is just the sum of n 2 1\u2019s, namely, I(q) = n 2 . In other words, the intensity scales quadratically rather than linearly with n, which means that these are extremely high peaks in I(q), namely, the Bragg peaks.\nFor C(q) to take the value 1 for some q, the products qd j must all be integer multiples of 2π. Suppose that q is such that qd 0 = 2πm for some integer m, i.e., q = q m ∆ = 2πm/d 0 , in which case we shall denote C(q m ) by C m , as before. In this case,\nBut this is again exactly the expression in (1), this time with α j = d j /d 0 , which as mentioned earlier, may assume the value 1, for some integer values of m, if and only if α j = d j /d 0 are all rational, or equivalently, d 0 , d 1 , . . . , d M −1 are commensurable. When this is the case, then as before, there exists an integer m for which md j /d 0 are all integers simultaneously. Analogously to the derivation in Section 2, let m 0 be the smallest integer with this property. Then, the Bragg peaks appear at wave-numbers q km 0 , k = 1, 2, . . ., which correspond to wavelengths λ 0 /k, where λ 0 = d 0 /m 0 .\nThe analogy between the two settings is now clear: The redundancy pattern of the Shannon code for a source with letter probabilities p 0 , . . . , p M −1 , is intimately related to the diffraction pattern of the HT model with the same probabilities and corresponding distances 1, log(p 0 /p j ),...,log(p 0 /p M −1 ). Stated differently, the memoryless source of Section 2 is parallel to the random selection process in the HT model and the parameters α j = log(p 0 /p j ) of the source are analogous to distance ratios d j /d 0 , j = 1, 2, . . . , M − 1. Their rationality/irrationality dictates the mode of behavior in both problems. The integer parameter m 0 is then deﬁned in both settings in the very same way. The partially ordered mode in the diffraction model is parallel to the oscillatory mode of R n in the data compression problem, and the Bragg peaks at all harmonics of the fundamental wave-number q m 0 = 2πm 0 /d 0 correspond to all harmonics of the fundamental frequency ω 0 = 2πβm 0 in the oscillatory component of R n . In other words, the parameter β is conjugate, in this sense, to 1/d 0 and one can think of the oscillatory mode of R n as a mode of constructive interference between the harmonic waves of its Fourier representation, where temporal the frequency ω is in analogy to the spatial frequency (or the wave number) q in the diffraction problem.\nIn this short paper, we have made an attempt to provide some insight into the erratic behavior of the redundancy pattern of the Shannon code for lossless data compression. The insight we propose is rooted in the physical point of view, where the two modes of the behavior of the redundancy patterns are respectively analogous to partial order and complete disorder of a wave diffraction medium, which dictates the existence or non\u2013existence of Bragg peaks pertaining to perfectly con- structive interference. It is hoped that this physical insight contributes to the intuitive understanding of the redundancy of the Shannon code and perhaps other codes as well.\nFinally, as a suggestion for possible future work, it would be interesting to generalize the above analyzes to the case of ﬁnite\u2013state Markov sources (and indeed, Markov models have been proposed in the diffraction setting too [5],[14]). While we have not studied that Markov case thoroughly, it is speculated that in this case, both in the data compression problem and in the HT model, the role played by high powers of C m would be essentially replaced by high powers of state transition probability matrix whose entries are weighted by the appropriate complex exponentials (which depend on m). It is\nexpected that what should matter then are the eigenvalues of this matrix. More concretely, it is not difﬁcult to see that the spectral radius, in both settings, never exceeds unity. In the data compression problem, the critical behavior is believed to be dictated by the existence or non\u2013existence of integer values {m} for which the spectral radius is exactly 1. When such values of m exist, then R n should have an oscillatory behavior. In the diffraction problem, the distinction between the two types of behavior should be dictated by the existence of values of m for which one of the eigenvalues is exactly equal to one."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
