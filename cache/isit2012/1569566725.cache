The compound-wiretap channel [3] model is an extension of the standard wiretap channel model where the channels of both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper belong to a set of possible channels. This setup also models the possibility of having multiple receivers in each of the two groups. The secrecy capacity of the compound wiretap channel remains open in general and only some special cases have been resolved [3]\u2013[9]. In particular, the secrecy capacity has been resolved for the case of parallel independent channels when either there are multiple legitimate receivers and one eavesdropper [6] and when there are multiple eavesdroppers and one legitimate receiver [5], [8]. In the former setup, the capacity is achieved using a secure-multicast codebook, which consists of independent wiretap codebooks on each of the links that individually secure the message from an eavesdropper on that link. An alternate construction that involves indirect decoding is proposed for the case of two channels in [7]. In the other extreme, i.e., when there are multiple eavesdroppers and one legitimate receiver, a secure-product codebook con- struction is proposed in [5], [8] and shown to be optimal. A key property of this construction is that the output codeword on any given link is independent of the output codewords on other links. In both these cases the secrecy capacity coincides\nwith a natural pairwise upper bound which is known to be not tight in general [6].\nIn this paper we propose a superposition coding technique that combines the secure multicast and secure product code- book construction discussed above. In our setup of interest, there are two groups of users. Group 1 consists of K users and group 2 consists of one user. There are two messages, one for each group and each message needs to be communicated to all users in the respective group and secured from the users in the other group. We refer to this setup as private broadcasting. It has been studied previously in [10]\u2013[12] when there is a single user in each group (i.e., K = 1) and in reference [6] for a special compound channel. We establish the optimality of the superposition technique for the case when K = 2 and when a particular degradation structure is assumed across the parallel channels.\nOur setup involves two independent parallel channels, two groups and three receivers. Receiver 1 and 2 belong to group 1 and observe output y 1 = (y 11 , y 12 ) and y 2 = (y 21 , y 22 ) re- spectively whereas receiver 3 belongs to group 2 and observes the output symbol z = (z 1 , z 2 ). The channel input symbols are x 1 and x 2 . Throughout this paper we additionally assume the following degradation order\nx 1 → y 11 → z 1 → y 21 \t (1) x 2 → y 22 → z 2 → y 12 \t (2)\nWe intend to transmit message m 1 to receiver 1 and 2 in group 1, while the message m 2 must be transmitted to receiver 3 in group 2. A length n private broadcast code also satisﬁes\nTheorem 1: Let auxiliary variables u 1 and u 2 satisfy the following Markov conditions:\nu 1 → x 1 → y 11 → z 1 → y 21 \t (4) u 2 → x 2 → y 22 → z 2 → y 12 \t (5)\nThe capacity region is the union of all rate pairs ( R 1 , R 2 ) that satisfy the following constraints:\nI(x 2 ; y 22 |u 2 ) − I(x 2 ; z 2 |u 2 ) \t (6) R 2 ≤ min {I(u 1 ; z 1 ) − I(u 1 ; y 21 ), I(u 2 ; z 2 ) − I(u 2 ; y 12 )} 2\nThe proposed coding scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1. The message for group 2 is encoded using a product codebook and the corresponding codewords ( u n 1 , u n 2 ) constitute the cloud- centers of a superposition codebook as shown. The codewords of the secure multicast codebook on each of the channels constitute the satellite codewords. For each message m 1 , a total of 2 nI(x i ;z i |u i ) satellite codewords are sampled condition- ally given u n i . Our secrecy analysis reveals that despite this structure in the codebook, it sufﬁces for each user in group 1 to treat the satellite codeword on the weaker channel as a noisy version of the cloud center u n i .\nThe result in Theorem 1 can be extended to the case of Gaussian parallel channels. Consider a Gaussian Channel model described by\nwhere w j ∼ N (0, σ 2 j ) and n k ∼ N (0, δ 2 k ) and s k ∼ N (0, γ 2 k ) for j, k = 1, 2. A sum-power constraint E[x 2 1 + x 2 2 ] ≤ P is imposed on the input symbols.\nTheorem 2: The capacity region for private broadcasting over two-parallel Gaussian channels in (8) is the union of all rate tuple ( R 1 , R 2 ) that satisfy\nR 1 ≤ min(R 11 , R 12 ) \t (9) R 2 ≤ min(R 21 , R 22 ) \t (10)\n(11) R 12 = 1 2 log 1 + P 12 σ 2\n(12) R 21 = 1 2 log 1 + \t P 21 P\n(13) R 22 = 1 2 log 1 + \t P 22 P 12 + σ 2\nFig. 1: Proposed Superposition Coding Scheme. The code- words of the product code ( u n 1 , u n 2 ) constitute cloud-centers whereas the codewords of the multicast code constitute the sattelite codewords.\nThe coding scheme uses a product codebook for message m 2 in order to guarantee that it is decodable by the user in group 2 and kept secure from all users in group 1. A multicast code is used for message m 1 in order to guarantee that it is decodable by the users in group 1 and kept secure from the single user in group 2. On each channel, a superposition codebook is applied where the codeword of the product codebook is a cloud center and the codeword of the multicast codebook is the satellite codeword.\nThe construction of the product codebook C 2 is as follows. Consider the set M 21 of all binary sequences of length N 21 = n(I(u 1 ; z 1 ) − ε) and the set M 22 of all binary sequences of length N 22 = n(I(u 2 ; z 2 ) − ε). We partition the cartesian product M 21 × M 22 into 2 nR 2 bins so that each bin contains 2 n(I(u 1 ;z 1 )+I(u 2 ;z 2 )−R 2 ) elements of the product- set. Each element m 21 ∈ M 21 is encoded using a codebook C 21 whose codewords are sampled i.i.d. from the distribution p u 1 (u 1 ). The elements m 22 ∈ M 22 are encoded using a codebook C 22 whose elements are sampled i.i.d. from the distribution p u 2 (u 2 ). Each message m 2 ∈ [1, 2 nR 2 ] constitutes the bin-index of our product codebook. An element ( m 21 , m 22 ) is selected uniformly at random from the bin associated with m 2 . The corresponding codewords ( u n 1 (m 21 ), u n 2 (m 22 )) constitute the cloud center of the superposition codebooks on each link. We note that by construction we have that each element ( m 21 , m 22 ) is equally likely and,\nFor each codeword sequence u n 1 ∈ C 21 , we generate code- book C 11 (u n 1 ) consisting of a total of 2 nR 1 bins and 2 n(I(x 1 ;z 1 |u 1 )+ε) codewords in each bin. Each codeword is sampled i.i.d. from the conditional distribution p x 1 |u 1 (x 1i |u 1i ).\nIn an analogous manner, for each u n 2 ∈ C 22 , we generate a codebook C 12 (u n 2 ) consisting of a total of 2 nR 1 bins and 2 n(I(x 2 ;z 2 |u 2 )+ε) codewords. Each codeword is sampled i.i.d. from the conditional distribution p x 2 |u 2 (x 2i |u 2i ).\nGiven a message m 1 and a sequence pair ( u n 1 , u n 2 ) we select a codeword pair ( x n 1 , x n 2 ) uniformly at random from the bins corresponding to m 1 in codebooks C 11 (u n 1 ) and C 12 (u n 2 ) respectively. Receiver 1 in group 1 searches for a codeword pair ( x n 1 , u n 1 , y n 11 ) that are jointly typical. This succeeds with high probability since our choice of R 1 guarantees that the total number of codewords in the satellite codebook is no greater than 2 nI(x 1 ;y 11 ) . In turn the receiver decodes m 1 with high probability. Likewise user 2 in group 1 can decode m 1 with high probability using the output y n 22 . Similarly by construction of C 21 and C 22 , user 2 can decode sub-messages m 21 and m 22 with high probability and in turn ﬁnd the corresponding message m 2 .\nFor message m 1 we need to show that 1\nn I(m 1 ; z n 1 , z n 2 |C) ≤ ε n \t (16) where C denotes the particular codebook selected in the ensemble. Note that from (15) the messages ( m 21 , m 22 ) are mutually independent. From this it can be shown that outputs (z n 1 , z n 2 ) are conditionally independent given m 1 . Thus we have,\n= 1 n H(z n 1 , z n 2 |C) − 1 n H(z n 1 |m 1 , C) − 1 n H(z n 2 |m 1 , C) (18) ≤ 1 n I(z n 1 ; m 1 |C) + 1 n I(z n 2 ; m 1 |C) \t (19)\nBy construction of each super-position codebook, there are 2 nI(x i ;z i |u i ) codewords in each bin and hence through standard analysis we can show that 1 n I(m 1 ; z n j ) ≤ ε n /2. Thus (16) follows.\nTo establish the secrecy of message m 2 with respect to the users in group 1 we show that provided R 2 satisﬁes (7) we have that\nn H(m 2 |y n j1 , y n j2 , C) ≥ R 2 − ε n , j = 1, 2. (20) Consider the case when j = 1.\nn H(m 2 |y n 1 , m 1 , m 21 , C) \t (21) = 1 n H(m 22 |y n 1 , m 1 , m 21 , C) − 1 n H(m 22 |m 2 , m 21 , m 1 , y n 1 , C)\n(22) = 1 n H(m 22 |m 1 , y n 12 , C) − 1 n H(m 22 |m 2 , m 21 , m 1 , y n 1 , C)\n(23) where (23) follows from the fact that m 22 → (m 1 , y n 12 ) → (m 21 , y n 11 ) holds, since the two sub-messages (m 21 , m 22 ) are\nmutually independent (c.f. (15)) and hence the knowledge of (m 21 , y n 11 ) do not help user 1 in group 1 to decode m 22 .\nTo lower bound the ﬁrst term observe that from the sym- metry of code construction\nn H(m 22 |m 1 = 1, y n 12 , C) (24) and since m 22 ∈ [1, 2 n(I(u 2 ;z 2 )−ε) ], and for each u n 2 (m 22 ) a total of 2 nI(x 2 ;z 2 |u 2 ) sequences are sampled in C 12 in the bin m 1 = 1 it follows from the analysis of a random wiretap code [13, Remark 22.2, pp. 555] that\nn H(m 22 |m 1 = 1, y n 12 , C) ≥ I(u 2 ; z 2 ) − I(u 2 ; y 12 ) (25) To bound the second term we note that from symmetry 1\nFurthermore in the product code construction, for each m 21 ∈ M 21 there are a total of |M 22 | = 2 n(I(u 2 ;z 2 )−ε) possible values for m 22 . Due to random partitioning, which high prob- ability the number of sequences in the bin with m 2 = 1 is at- most |M 22 |·2 −n(R 2 −ε) . Since R 2 < I(u 2 ; z 2 )−I(u 2 ; y 22 )−2ε it can be shown along the lines of [13, Lemma 22.1, pp. 554] that\nSubstituting (27) and (25) into (23) we recover (20) for j = 1. The result for j = 2 can be established in a similar fashion.\nThe intuition behind the converse is the following. Suppose we are not required to transmit any information to receiver 2 in group 1. Furthermore suppose that we are also not required to secure message m 2 from user 1 in group 1. We only need to send message m 1 to receiver 1 while securing it from receiver 3 in group 2 and transmit m 2 while only securing it against user 2 in group 1. Looking at the degradation order on channel 2, it is apparent that no information must be transmitted on channel 2. Once we restrict our attention to channel 1 we have a degraded broadcast channel x 1 → y 11 → z 1 → y 21 where the message m 1 needs to be protected from the two weaker receivers whereas the message m 2 needs to be only protected from the weakest receiver. For this simpliﬁed problem we show that\nSimilarly by relaxing symmetric constraints on message trans- mission and secrecy we obtain the the remaining two con- straints. A formal proof is discussed next.\nConsider a sequence of codes indexed by the length n that satisfy (3), as well as the Fano Inequality\nwhere we introduce y j = (y j1 , y j2 ) and z = (z 1 , z 2 ). By weakening user 2 on link 2 from y 22 to z 2 it follows from (3) that \t 1\nn I(m 2 ; y n 21 , z n 2 ) ≤ ε n \t (30) Now consider:\nnR 2 ≤ I(m 2 ; z n ) − I(m 2 ; y n 21 , z n 2 ) + 2nε n \t (31) ≤ I(m 2 ; z n 1 |y n 21 z n 2 ) + 2nε n \t (32)\nI(u 1i ; z 1i |y 21i ) + 2nε n , \t (35) = nI(u 1 ; z 1 |y 21 , q) + 2nε n \t (36) ≤ nI(u 1 ; z 1 |y 21 ) + 2nε n \t (37)\nwhere we use the Markov relation y i−1 21 → z i−1 1 \t → (m 2 , z 1i , y n 21,i , z n 2 ) in (34) which follows from the structure of the channel and in (35) we deﬁne u 1i = (m 2 , z i−1 1 , y n 21,i+1 , z n 2 ) that satisﬁes u 1i → x i → y 11i → z 1i → y 21i and where (36) follows by deﬁning a time-sharing random variable q to be uniformly distributed over {1, . . . , n} and independent of all other variables and letting u 1 = (q, u 1q ), x = x q , y 21 = y 21q and z 1 = z 1q respectively and ﬁnally (37) follows from the fact that q → u 1 → (z 1 , y 21 ).\nThe secrecy condition with respect to m 1 is 1\nn H(m 2 |z n ) = 2ε n , (38) which follows by substituting (3) and (29).\nnR 1 ≤ I(m 1 ; y n 1 ) − I(m 1 ; z n , m 2 ) + 3nε n \t (39) ≤ I(m 1 ; y n 1 |z n , m 2 ) + 3nε n \t (40) = I(m 1 ; y n 11 |z n , m 2 ) + 3nε n \t (41) = H(y n 11 |z n , m 2 ) − H(y n 11 |m 1 , m 2 , z n ) + 3nε n (42)\nwhere \t (41) \t follows \t from \t the \t fact \t that y n 21 → z n 2 → (m 1 , m 2 , z n 1 , y n 11 ) holds from the structure of the channel.\nWe next bound each of the terms in (42). The second term can be lower bounded by:\nwhere the last step follows from the memoryless property of the channel.\nSubstituting (44) and (45) into (42) we get R 1 ≤ 1 n n\nI(x 1i ; y 11i |z 1i , u 1i ) + 3ε n \t (46) = I(x 1 ; y 11 |z 1 , u 1 ) + 3ε n . \t (47)\nwhere the last step follows by since q is uniformly distributed over {1, . . . , n} and independent of all other variables and u 1 = (q, u 1,q ), x 1 = x 1q , y 21 = y 21q and z 1 = z 1q respectively.\nIn an analogous manner we can deﬁne a random variable v for this problem such that\nThe achievability follows by selecting a Gaussian input distribution in Theorem 1. In particular let x 1 ∼ N (0, P 1 ) and x 2 ∼ N (0, P 2 ). Furthermore let u 1 ∼ N (0, P 21 ) and u 2 ∼ N (0, P 22 ). Let x 1 = x 11 + u 1 , where x 11 ∼ N (0, P 11 ) is independent of u 1 and similarly let x 2 = x 12 + u 2 where x 12 ∼ N (0, P 12 ) is independent of u 2 . Evaluating\nR 11 = I(x 1 ; y 11 |u 1 ) − I(x 1 ; z 1 |u 1 ) \t (49) R 12 = I(x 2 ; y 22 |u 2 ) − I(x 2 ; z 2 |u 2 ) \t (50) R 21 = I(u 1 ; z 1 ) − I(u 1 ; y 21 ) \t (51) R 22 = I(u 2 ; z 2 ) − I(u 2 ; y 12 ) \t (52)\nwith the above choice of input distribution results in (11)- (14). To establish that a Gaussian distribution in indeed optimal,\n= h(y 11 |u 1 ) − h(z 1 |u 1 ) − h(y 11 |x 1 ) + h(z 1 |x 1 ) (53) = h(y 11 |u 1 ) − h(z 1 |u 1 ) − h(w 1 ) + h(n 1 ) \t (54)\nwhere we use u 1 → x 1 → (y 11 , z 1 ) in (53) and use the channel model (8) in (54). Similarly,\nR 21 = I(u 1 ; z 1 ) − I(u 1 ; y 21 ) \t (55) = h(z 1 ) − h(y 21 ) + [h(y 21 |u 1 ) − h(z 1 |u 1 )] \t (56) = h(z 1 ) − h(z 1 + s 1 ) + [h(y 21 |u 1 ) − h(z 1 |u 1 )]. (57) ≤ 1 2 log P 1 + σ 2 1 + δ 2 1 P\nwhere P 1 Δ = E[x 2 1 ] and the last step follows from the worst- case additive noise lemma [14]. Using this, it can also be shown that:\n(59) To establish (59) note that h(y 11 |u) − h(z 1 |u) = −I(z 1 ; n 1 |u) where the noise n 1 ∼ N (0, δ 2 1 ) is independent u. For the upper bound note that\nThe last step follows from the worst-case additive noise lemma. For the lower bound, note that since u 1 → x → z 1 holds and n 1 is independent of these random variables we have I(z 1 ; n 1 |u 1 ) ≤ I(z 1 ; n 1 |x) = I(n 1 + w 1 ; n 1 ) = 1 2 log σ 2 1 + δ 2 1 σ 2\nHence for some 0 ≤ P 11 ≤ P 1 we have that h(y 11 |u 1 ) − h(z 1 |u 1 ) = 1 2 log P 11 + σ 2 1 P 11 + σ 2\nUpon substituting (60) into (54) we establish (11). To establish the bound for R 21 we use the following extremal inequality:\nP 11 +σ 2 1 + 1 it can be shown that the optimal t = P 11 and through some straightforward computation it follows from (61) and (60) that\nSubstituting into (58) we have that R 21 ≤ 1 2 log P 1 + σ 2 1 + δ 2 1 P\n(63) from which we recover (13) by deﬁning P 21 = P 1 − P 11 . The upper bounds on R 12 and R 22 can be established in a similar fashion and will be skipped.\nWe study the problem of secure broadcasting of two mes- sages to two groups of users over two independent and parallel channels. Group 1 has two receivers, both interested in a common message, whereas group 2 has only one receivers. Each message must be kept secure from user(s) in the other group. For a particular degradation structure we establish the optimality of a technique that combines a product code and a multicast code using a superposition codebook. For the case of\nGaussian channels we use an extremal inequality to establish the optimality of Gaussian codebooks. While the results are derived for a special channel model, we expect the coding techniques to naturally generalize for multiple channels with arbitrary number of users in group 1 and a single user in group 2. Such an extension will be reported elsewhere."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A. D. Wyner"}],"title":{"text":"The common information of two dependent random variables"}},{"authors":[{"name":"I.
