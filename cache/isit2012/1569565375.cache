In particular, time or phase asynchronism in wireless channels due to factors such as feedback delay, the bursty nature of some applications, and reaction delay, make the design of precoders/encoders much more difﬁcult [12]. Moreover, in wireless multi-user systems, interference and relaying from other sources can make synchronization a more complex problem.\nIn point-to-point wireless systems, achieving receiver syn- chronization is possible in principle, using training sequences and/or feedback. However, the assumption of full receiver- transmitter synchronization, although analytically convenient, is rarely practical and it is in some cases theoretically infeasi- ble [16]. In highly mobile environments, for instance, fading in conjunction with feedback delay may result in out of date phase knowledge by the time it reaches the transmitters.\nChannel uncertainty, i.e., the situations in which the com- municating parties (or some of them) have to work without the full knowledge of the law governing the channel [7], is a suitable framework to analytically study the issue of phase asynchronism. Also, in order to study information- theoretical aspects of this problem, the mathematical model of a compound channel has been proposed by various authors [3], [15]. A compound channel is generally represented by a family of transition probabilities p θ Y |X , where the index θ is the state of the channel and is chosen from a set Θ that models the uncertainty.\nIn this paper, we are interested in joint source-channel coding for phase asynchronous wireless networks involving essential elements of wireless communications, i.e, interfer- ence and cooperation. The problem of ﬁnding the optimal solution for lossless/lossy joint source-channel coding over an arbitrary communication network is open in general. For lossy source-channel coding over interference networks, a separation\napproach is shown in [13] to be optimal or approximately optimal to communicate independent sources. Their results are based on building channel codes on top of previously existing joint source-channel codes and thus the distortion region (or inner/outer bounds on it) is not found. In [4], on the other hand, it is shown that separate source-channel coding is not optimal for lossless transmission of correlated sources over a multiple access channel (MAC). However, in [2], [1], the authors show that performing separate source and channel coding for the important case of a Gaussian MAC with unknown phase shifts at the encoders is optimal for the lossless case. They have also shown optimality of separation for the MAC in the lossy coding context in the high ﬁdelity regime.\nThe recent work [8] addresses the lossless joint source- channel coding problem for a phase fading Gaussian multiple access relay channel and proves a separation theorem under some channel coefﬁcients. For the achievability part, the authors use the results of [6], and [11], based on a combination of Markov encoding at the encoders and backward decoding at the receiver [5].\nHerein, we consider the problem of sending a pair of correlated Gaussian sources over a phase-fading Gaussian interference relay channel which manifests both interference and cooperation in wireless communications. The transmitters encode the continuous sources and send them over the channel while satisfying certain power constraints. We assume that the phase shifts over channels under consideration are random but ﬁxed over the block length. As a practical assumption, we assume that the phases are not known to the transmitters and the relay while the channel state information (CSI) is available to decoders. We thus refer to the channel under consideration as a phase incoherent interference relay channel (PI-IRC). At the receivers, the sources are intended to be reconstructed with the best possible minimum square error distortions. The contributions of this work are as follows:\n\u2022 We ﬁrst ﬁnd a rectangular outer bound to the distortion region which is represented by constraints on D 1 and D 2 .\n\u2022 Under speciﬁc strong interference gain conditions, and under the extra condition of strong gains from transmit- ters to the relay, we ﬁnd an inner bound to the distortion region represented by constraints on D 1 , D 2 , and D 1 D 2 . For a ﬁxed correlation coefﬁcient between the sources, we show that in the high SNR regime, the constraints on D 1 and D 2 of the inner bound coincide with those of the outer bound whereas the third constraint of the inner bound shrinks a portion of the achievable distortion region proportional to 1 1−ρ 2 where ρ is the correlation coefﬁcient.\n\u2022 In the case of independent sources (again under strong interference conditions), we show that the inner bound exactly matches the outer bound and consequently fully characterize the achievable distortion region. Namely, we ﬁnd the optimal distortion region and determine the optimality of separate source and channel coding for the\nphase incoherent case, as opposed to cases where the transmitters have knowledge of the phase shifts and could potentially achieve higher rates using beamforming, for example.\n\u2022 Similar inner and outer bounds can be found for an inter- ference channel with an arbitrary number of relays under phase asynchronism. Our results can also be specialized to an interference channel by omitting the relay, i.e., an inner and outer bound to the distortion region as well as the optimal joint source channel coding distortion region for independent sources are also found. For the case of no relay (interference channel), the results hold for both phase coherent and incoherent scenarios.\nAlthough we assume non-ergodic phase shifts throughout the paper, as in [1], [6, Thm. 2], our results also apply to the case where the phases change i.i.d. from symbol to symbol. Also, in this paper, we focus on the strong interference regime, leaving other interference conditions as considerable future works.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the preliminaries along with a key lemma. Next, the outer bound and the inner bound on the achievable distortion region are described and proved in Section III. In Section IV, we state specializations of our results to the high SNR regime, independent sources and interference channel. Finally we conclude the paper in Section V.\nConsider a memoryless bivariate Gaussian source consisting of two zero-mean correlated Gaussian outputs (U 1 , U 2 ) with covariance matrix\nwhere ρ ∈ [−1, 1]. Both of the sources are to be transmitted to the corresponding destinations through a continuous alphabet and discrete-time memoryless non-ergodic Gaussian interfer- ence relay channel. The setup is shown in Fig. 1. The channel is parameterized by the phase shifts that are introduced by different paths of the network and are, as a realistic assumption for wireless networks, not known to the transmitters. The vector θ denotes the phase fading parameters. Encoders wish to use codes that are robust for all θ. In our model, the receiver is fully aware of θ. For simplicity, throughout the paper, we assume that transmitter node with index i ∈ {1, 2, r} has power constraint P i and the noise power at all corresponding receiving nodes is N .\nSuch a channel is referred to as a compound channel [3], [15]. Nevertheless, in order to avoid ambiguity, we call the particular channel under consideration a phase-incoherent interference relay channel (PI-IRC).\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the PI-IRC (X 1 × X 2 × X r , Y 1 × Y 2 × Y r , p θ (y 1 , y 2 , y r |x 1 , x 2 , x r )) is described by relationships\nwhere X 1i , X 2i , X ri , Y 1i , Y 2i , Y ri ∈ C, Z 1i , Z 2i , Z ri ∼ CN (0, N ) are circularly symmetric complex Gaussian noises, g 11 , g 21 , g r 1 , g 12 , g 22 , g r 2 , g 1r , g 2r are ﬁxed channel gains, and parameter θ = (θ 11 ,θ 21 , θ r 1 ,θ 12 , θ 22 , θ r 2 , θ 1r , θ 2r )∈\n[0, 2π) 8 represents the phase shifts introduced by the channel to inputs X 1 , X 2 and X r , respectively.\nDeﬁnition 1: Let X = (X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X m ), be a vec- tor of random variables with joint distribution p X and max i E X i 2 ≤ ∞. Also let the scalar RV V\ng i e jθ i X i + Z, where g i e jθ i are arbitrary complex coef- ﬁcients and Z ∼ CN (0, N ).\nWe now present a key lemma which asserts that the min- imum over θ = (θ 1 , θ 2 , · · · , θ m ) of the mutual informa- tion between X and V , is maximized when X is a zero- mean Gaussian vector with independent elements, i.e., RVs X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X m are independent Gaussians with zero mean.\nNotation : For convenience, we denote the mutual informa- tion between X and V by\nLemma 1: [10] Let P = {p X : E X i 2 ≤ P i , ∀i} and p ∗ X ∈ P be a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with independent elements and E X i 2 = P i , ∀i. Then,\ni.e., when θ is chosen adversarially, the best X is a zero-mean Gaussian vector with independent elements and Var(X i ) = P i , ∀i.\nDeﬁnition 2: Joint source-channel code: A joint source- channel code of length n for the PI-IRC with correlated sources is deﬁned by\n1 n\nwhere E is the expectation operation over the distribu- tion induced by U n 1 , U n 2 .\nThe estimated vectors g n θ , 1 (Y 1 ), g n θ , 2 (Y 2 ) are denoted by ˆ U 1 , ˆ U 2 respectively.\nDeﬁnition 3: A distortion pair (D 1 , D 2 ) is said to be achievable if there exists a sequence of encoding functions satisfying the corresponding power constraints and decoding functions, such that the average minimum squared error (MSE) resulting from functions satisfy\n1 n\nA necessary condition for the pair (D 1 , D 2 ) to be achievable is given by\nLet {x n 1 (u n 1 ), x n 2 (u n 2 )}, and g n 1θ , g n 2θ be sequences in n of codebooks and decoders for the PI-IC for which (D 1 , D 2 ) is achievable. Fix a PI-IRC with given param- eter θ, a codebook C, and induced empirical distribution p(u 1 , u 2 , x 1 , x 2 , x r )p θ (y 1 , y 2 , y r |x 1 , x 2 , x r ). Then we have\n≤ n h(g 11 X 1 e jθ 11 + g r 1 X r e jθ r1 + Z 1 ) − n h(Z 1 ) (5) where (a) and (b) follow by deﬁning new random variables\nNote that from (1), the input signals X 1 , X r satisfy the power constraints\n1 n\nSince (5) can be derived for all values of θ, we have min\n≤ n log 1 + (g 2 11 P 1 + g 2 r 1 P r )/N . \t (6) where p X 1 ,X r is the joint distribution of (X 1 , X r ) and (c) follows directly from Lemma 1.\n= h U 1 |X 2 − h(U 1 |X 2 , Y 1 , θ) ≥ h U 1 |U 2 , X 2 − h U 1 − ˆ U 1 )\nwhere (d) is a straight forward result of (7) fol- lowing from the achievability assumption on D 1 . Thus combining the lower and upper bounds (6), (8) on lim inf n →∞ min θ I(U 1 , X r ; Y 1 |X 2 , θ)\nSimilarly, we derive the same inequality for D 2 and there- fore two of the inequalities of Theorem 1 are established.\nNow, \t by \t similar \t arguments \t and \t reusing Lemma 1, we derive lower and upper bounds on \t lim inf n →∞ min θ 1 n I(X 1 , X 2 , X r ; Y 1 |θ), \t and lim inf n →∞ min θ 1 n I(X 1 , X 2 , X r ; Y 2 |θ):\n≤ log 1 + (g 2 11 P 1 + g 2 21 P 2 + g 2 r 1 P r )/N , (9) and\nwhich results in lim inf\nThe proof of the converse is complete by noting that a similar bound on D 2 can be found by following similar steps for I(X 1 , X 2 , X r ; Y 2 |θ).\nTheorem 2: Suppose the strong interference gain condi- tions\ng 2 11 P 1 +g 2 r 1 P r ≤ g 2 1r P 1 , \t (13) g 2 22 P 2 +g 2 r 2 P r ≤ g 2 2r P 2 , \t (14)\nhold. An achievable distortion region for source-channel com- munication of (U 1 , U 2 ) over the PI-IRC is given by\nProof: To establish the achievability argument, we follow a separate source-channel coding scheme based on lossy distributed source coding and reliable channel coding for the PI-IRC where both of the receivers are forced to estimate both of the sources with respective distortions D 1 , D 2 . The source coding indices and channel coding rates are denoted by ω 1i , ω 2i , and R 1 , R 2 respectively.\nSource Coding : An inner region R in (D 1 , D 2 ) on the rate region R(D 1 , D 2 ) of distributed source coding of two Gaus- sian sources for a common decoder is given in [9], [14]. The inner region can be reexpressed as the following achievable distortion region\nD 2 ≥ (1 − ρ 2 )2 −2R 2 + ρ 2 2 −2(R 1 +R 2 ) , 2D 1 D 2\nChannel Coding : Using block Markov coding in conjunction with backward decoding at the receivers and forward decoding at the relay, as shown in Table I, we can derive the following sufﬁcient conditions to reliably decode all messages at both decoders for a compound IRC [10]:\nFor independent Gaussians X 1 ∼ CN (0, P 1 ), X 2 ∼ CN (0, P 2 ), X r ∼ CN (0, P r ), the conditions (13)-(15) make\nthe ﬁrst terms of (20)-(22) larger than the others and hence we can drop them from the constraints. Also due to the strong in- terference conditions of (11) and (12), we can drop the mutual information terms I(X 1 , X r ; Y 2 |X 2 , θ), I(X 2 , X r ; Y 1 |X 1 , θ) from (20) and (21). Hence, for such independent Gaussians X 1 , X 2 , X r , the sufﬁcient conditions reduce to\nR 1 ≤ log(1 + (g 2 11 P 1 + g 2 r 1 P r )/N ), \t (23) R 2 ≤ log(1 + (g 2 22 P 2 + g 2 r 2 P r )/N ), \t (24)\nlog 1 − ρ 2 (1 + (g 2 11 P 1 + g 2 r 1 P r + g 2 21 P 2 )/N ) (26) R 2 = min log(1 + (g 2 12 P 1 + g 2 r 2 P r )/N ),\nand by the strong interference conditions (11) and (12), the constraints (23)-(25) are satisﬁed and we are guaranteed to have reliable decodings of both the ﬁrst and second channel encoders codewords. Furthermore, by replacing R 1 , R 2 , as chosen in (26) and (27), in (19), one obtains the achievable distortion region given by (16)-(18).\nRemark 1: A similar outer bound and inner bound can be derived for a phase incoherent interference channel with multiple relays.\nRemark 2: Note that if there are no relays in the network, for deriving the outer bound in Section III-A, Lemma 1 is not needed since there is only one phase in (5) then. Therefore, as opposed to the case of an interference relay channel, for an interference channel, the results carry on to the scenario in which the encoders are aware of the phase shifts as well. Namely, by removing relay dependant terms and redeﬁning A and B in (3) and (4), Theorem 1 applies to a general Gaussian interference channel. Theorem 2 can also be specialized to an interference channel with equations (11), (12) replaced by very strong interference conditions\ng 2 12 ≥g 2 11 (1 + g 2 22 P 2 /N ), \t (28) g 2 21 ≥g 2 22 (1 + g 2 11 P 1 /N ). \t (29)\nIn the moderate to high SNR regime, i.e., when the noise power N is relatively small, the second terms in the right hand sides of (16)-(18) will be negligible compared to the ﬁrst terms. The inner bound can thus be approximately (or exactly in the limit) described by {D 1 ≥ A, D 2 ≥ B, D 1 D 2 ≥\n}. Therefore, the constraints on D 1 and D 2 coincide in both the inner region and outer region. The third constraint on D 1 D 2 makes the inner region restricted by a curve and results in a ρ-dependant gap between the regions. This can be inferred as approximate optimality of separation for values of the correlation coefﬁcient that have small magnitude. A typical example is depicted in Fig. 2, where the approximate inner bound practically matches the actual inner bound. We also see that for ρ = 0, the regions exactly coincide for all SNR regimes.\n0 \t 0.005 \t 0.01 \t 0.015 \t 0.02 4 6 8\ng 12  = g 21  = 4.69 g 1r  = g 2r  = 3.46 SNR = 7 dB\nFor the special case of ρ = 0, the inner bound of Theorem 2 will coincide with the outer bound given in Theorem 1. Therefore, we can fully characterize the optimal distortion regions for the case of independent Gaussians and state the following separation theorem as a corollary.\nCorollary 1: Provided the gain conditions (11)-(15) are met, the set of all achievable distortion pairs (D 1 , D 2 ) for a PI-IRC with ρ = 0 is given by\nFurthermore, in order to achieve this distortion region, it is sufﬁcient to perform lossy source coding and channel coding separately.\nA similar corollary can be stated for an interference channel: Corollary 2: Provided the gain conditions (28), and (29)\nare met, the set of all achievable distortion pairs (D 1 , D 2 ) for an interference channel, with a pair of independent Gaussian sources, is given by\nFurthermore, in order to achieve this distortion region, it is enough to perform lossy source coding and channel coding separately.\nWe have derived a general outer bound on the distortion region, for sending a bivariate Gaussian source over an IRC under phase uncertainty at the transmitters. Using a separation approach, we then derived an inner bound for the distortion region under speciﬁc SNR-dependant gain conditions which mainly represent strong interferences between the transmitters and the unwanted receivers. Next, an approximation to the inner bound in the high SNR regime was found. Under the speciﬁed gain conditions and phase uncertainty at transmitters, we consequently characterized the achievable distortion region for independent sources and proved a separation theorem. By removing the relay, our results were specialized to communi- cation of independent Gaussians over an interference channel with SNR-dependant strong interference gains."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"F.
