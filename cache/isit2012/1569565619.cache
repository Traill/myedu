We call this the entanglement cost of a channel, and prove a formula describing it for all channels. We discuss two applications. Firstly, we are able to link the security in the noisy-storage model to a problem of sending quantum rather than classical information through the adversary\u2019s storage device. This not only greatly improves the range of parameters where security could be shown previously, but allows us to prove security for storage devices for which no non-trivial statements were known before. Secondly, our result has consequences for the study of the strong converse quantum capacity. Here, we show that any coding scheme that sends quantum information through a quantum channel at a rate larger than the entanglement cost of the channel has an exponentially small ﬁdelity."},"body":{"text":"One of the most fundamental problems in quantum infor- mation theory is to quantify the information theoretic power of quantum channels. Of particular interest is thereby the study of a channel\u2019s capacity for information transmission. This quantity tells us how many bits m we can send reliably when using the channel n times, using the best possible encoding and decoding process. Unlike classical channels, quantum channels have various distinct capacities. These de- pend, among other things, on what kind of information should be sent over the channel (e.g. classical or quantum) or on what kind of assistance is allowed (e.g. free entanglement or free classical communication). Important examples of quantum channel capacities include the entanglement assisted classical capacity C E [1], and the classical forward communication assisted quantum capacity Q ! [2], [3], [4]. The ﬁrst deals with sending classical information over a quantum channel in the presence of freely usable entanglement. The latter deals with the problem of sending quantum information itself, when we are allowed free classical communication from the sender to the receiver. One way of tackling the problem of capacities is to think more broadly in terms of one channel simulating another. For example, the process of sending m bits reliably using n uses of a channel E can be understood as a simulation of m perfect, noise-free, channels using n copies of E. The capacity of the channel E is then simply the rate m/n at which such a simulation is possible in the limit of large n. Instead of simulating a perfect channel from some noisy channel, one can also approach the problem from the other end. In particular, we can ask what is the optimal asymptotic rate at which\na perfect channel can simulate some noisy one? When our simulation can consume free entanglement between the sender and the receiver, this question is answered by the quantum reverse Shannon theorem. It states that the rate is given by the entanglement assisted classical capacity C E [5], [6]. Apart from its deep conceptual appeal, the quantum reverse Shannon theorem led to the proof that C E is in fact a strong converse capacity; a concept which we discuss in more detail below.\nIt is a natural question to ask what happens to such a simulation in the presence of other resources. In this work, we ask what is the optimal asymptotic rate at which a perfect quantum channel can simulate some noisy quantum channel E in the presence of free classical communication? We note that it does not matter if we allow free classical forward, backward, or even two-way communication; the optimal asymptotic rate turns out to be the same in all scenarios. The problem be understood as the \u2018reverse problem\u2019 for the classical communication assisted quantum capacities. Note that by quantum teleportation [7], the perfect quantum channel can equivalently be replaced with perfect entanglement. The central question of this paper can thus be summarized as\nAt what rate is entanglement needed in order to asymptotically simulate a quantum channel E, when classical communication is given for free?\nWe call this rate the entanglement cost E C of a quantum channel. Our main contribution in this paper is to prove the following formula\nwhere the maximization is over all puriﬁcations   n of input states to the n-fold tensor product quantum channel E ⌦n , I stands for the identity channel on the purifying system, and E F denotes the entanglement of formation deﬁned as\nwhere the inﬁmum ranges over all pure state decompositions ⇢ AB = P i p i |⇢ i ih⇢ i | AB , and H(.) denotes the von Neumann entropy. As with the known formula for the classical forward communication assisted quantum capacity, Equation (1)\ninvolves a regularization, and hence is not a single-letter formula. Note that even if we would know that we can restrict the maximization to non-entangled input states, Equation (1) would still not be a single-letter formula, due to Hasting\u2019s counterexample for the additivity of the entanglement of formation [8], [9]. However, we want to emphasize that we can compute explicit upper bounds for E C , which are particularly useful for the applications given below. The entanglement cost is in general larger than the classical communication assisted quantum capacities, which is in contrast to the case of free entanglement (where the rate is C E for both, the channel capacity and the reverse problem). Hence, simulating the perfect channel from a noisy one and then again the noisy channel, results in a net loss.\nAs the name entanglement cost suggests, E C ( E) can be seen as the channel analogue of the entanglement cost of quantum states E C (⇢) , which is deﬁned as the optimal asymptotic rate of entanglement that is needed in order to create a quantum state ⇢ in the iid scenario using local operations and classical communication [10], [11]. It is known that\n⌦n ) , \t (3) where E F again denotes the entanglement of formation. In the state problem, it is interesting to compare the entanglement cost E C (⇢) with the distillable entanglement E D (⇢) , which is the optimal asymptotic rate at which perfect entanglement can be distilled in the iid scenario using local operations and clas- sical communication [12]. As it turns out, there are quantum states with E C (⇢) > E D (⇢) , and even with E D (⇢) = 0 but E C (⇢) > 0 . These states are called bound entangled [13]. The corresponding quantum channel problem is then to compare E C ( E) with e.g. Q ! ( E), since by teleportation, Q ! ( E) is actually the same as the entanglement generating capacity E ! ( E) [2]. And indeed there are bound entangled quantum channels, e.g. all channels with positive partial transpose (PPT [14], [15]) but entangled Choi-Jamiolkowski state, be- cause then E C ( E) > 0 but Q ! ( E) = 0. In further analogy with the state problem, we can also show that E C ( E) is zero if and only if E is entanglement breaking.\nWe use one-shot information theory to derive our main result Equation (1). In contrast to the usual assumption of asymptotic iid resources in quantum information theory, one- shot information theory applies to arbitrary (structureless) resources. In the asymptotic iid regime many operational quantities can be expressed in terms of a few information measures based on the von Neumann entropy. The same holds true for the one-shot case by means of the smooth entropy for- malism [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. We work in this smooth entropy formalism and our proof is conceptually very similar to the proof of the quantum reverse Shannon theorem given in [6]. In order to prove the direct part of Equation (1), we need to show the existence of a channel simulation for\nE ⌦n , whose asymptotic rate of entanglement consumption is upper bounded by E C ( E). That is, we need to construct a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map that is asymptotically arbitrarily close to E ⌦n in the diamond norm (which is the dual of the completely bounded norm [23]), and that consists only of using maximally entangled states at an asymptotic rate of at most E C ( E), local operations, and classical communication. Here it is worth to note that even though the channel to simulate E ⌦n has iid structure, the channel simulation also has to work on non-iid inputs (and this is also the reason why Equation (1) does not just easily follow from Equation (3)). The crucial idea is to employ the post-selection technique for quantum channels [24], which is a tool to bound the distance in diamond norm between two completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps that act symmetrically on an n-partite system. The technique upper bounds this distance by the distance arising from the puriﬁcation of a special de Finetti input state. That is, the puriﬁcation of a state which consists of n identical and inde- pendent copies of an (unknown) state on a single subsystem. Note that this puriﬁcation does not have iid structure. But now it is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd a CPTP map that creates the state given by E ⌦n applied to the puriﬁcation of the special de Finetti input state. It then remains to quantify how much entanglement is needed in order to create this state. Since this state does not have iid structure, we employ the one-shot entanglement cost for quantum states E (1) C (⇢ AB , \") , which quantiﬁes how much entanglement is needed in order to create one single copy of a bipartite quantum state ⇢ AB up to an error \" 0 using local operations and classical communication [25], [26]. Note that this is in contrast to the quantity E C (⇢ AB ) mentioned before, which answers the question of how much entanglement is needed in the asymptotic iid regime. The resulting asymptotic entanglement cost of the channel simulation is then upper bounded by an expression close to Equation (1), but with the maximization over input states and the minimization in the deﬁnition of the entanglement of formation interchanged. Finally, in order to arrive at Equation (1), we discretize the set of Kraus decompositions of E and apply Sion\u2019s minimax theorem [27].\nWe present two applications of our formula for the entangle- ment cost of channels and calculate some examples of interest. We start with the problem of proving security in the noisy storage model and then turn to the problem of deriving bounds for the strong converse of quantum capacities.\nAs a ﬁrst application we discuss security in the noisy- storage model [28], [29], [30]. For the ﬁrst time, we relate security in this model to a problem of sending quantum rather than classical information through the adversary\u2019s storage device. In particular, we show that any two-party cryptographic\nwhere the adversary\u2019s storage is of the form E ⌦⌫·m , m is the number of qubits transmitted during the protocol, and ⌫ is the storage rate (see Fig. 1). We can compute bounds for various channels of interest by means of our non-regularized achievability result for the entanglement cost\nwhere h(.) denotes the binary Shannon entropy, C(.) the concurrence (see [31], [32]), and is the maximally entangled state between the input and the purifying system. Our analysis not only greatly improves the range of parameters when security can be obtained, we also obtain non-trivial bounds for dephasing noise, and can ﬁnd bounds for the security for any qubit channel such as amplitude damping noise (see Fig. 2-4).\nTo determine a quantum channel\u2019s capacity for sending information, two aspects need to be addressed. First of all, one needs to show that the capacity can be achieved. That is, there exists some coding scheme that allows to transmit information reliably at any rate up to the capacity. Second, however, the capacity should really form a threshold for information transmission. That is, if one tries to send information at a rate above the capacity, then there exists no coding scheme that allows to send information without any error. Such a statement is also known as a weak converse. This however, does not yet exclude the possibility of sending information with a small error at a rate that exceeds the capacity. The minimal rate for which the success in transmitting information drops exponentially with the number of channel uses, is known as the strong converse capacity. The strong converse capacity is appealing since it really gives a sharp threshold for information transmission. But to determine the strong converse capacity forms a challenge even when it comes to sending classical information. Only when restricted to non-entangled input states [33], [34] or certain classes of quantum channels [35], it is known that the strong converse classical capacity is actually the same as the classical capacity. However, upper bounds on the strong\nconverse classical capacity are known [5], [36], [37]. For example, the quantum reverse Shannon theorem shows that the entanglement assisted classical capacity C E and its strong converse version are identical [5]. Of course C E is then also an upper bound on the unassisted strong converse classical capacity. In addition, the result immediately implies that the entanglement assisted quantum capacity Q E = C E /2 and its strong converse version are identical. Thus, Q E is an upper bound on the unassisted strong converse quantum capacity.\nThe second application of our result is a new upper bound to the strong converse capacity for sending quantum information. Similar to the quantum reverse Shannon theorem, we employ the idea of a channel simulation to prove that when we send quantum information at a rate exceeding E C , the error rate is lower bounded by\n\" n 1 2 O(n) . \t (7) Our bound holds for all channels E and the two-way classical communication assisted quantum capacity Q $ (and with that also for Q ! ). We note that he bound E C is independent of Q E and can in general be stronger or weaker. As an example we mention the qubit dephasing channel E deph (⇢) = (1 p)⇢ + p · z ⇢ z with z =\nQ E ( E deph ) = 1 1 2 · h( p 2 ) , \t (10) where h(.) denotes the binary Shannon entropy. As shown in Fig. 5 this is far from being tight, but we are not aware of any better better bounds on the strong converse quantum capacity. In addition, note that Q $ can be much larger than Q ! and we conclude with the following upper bound, which holds for every qubit channel\nwhere is the maximally entangled state between the input and the purifying system.\nWe calculated the rate of entanglement needed in order to asymptotically simulate a quantum channel when classical communication is for free. Because of the free classical communication, the problem is equivalent to the question about the rate of quantum communication needed in order to simulate a quantum channel. A natural subsequent question is to ask what rate of classical communication is actually needed. However, in the spirit about general quantum channel simulations, we might even want to ask more generally about rate triples (q, e, c) needed in order to achieve the channel simulation, where q denotes quantum communication, e entan- glement, and c classical communication. The quantum reverse\nShannon theorem can then be understood as e.g. (Q E , 1, 0) or (0, 1, C E ) (to be precise, the entanglement has to be given in the form of so-called embezzling states [38], [5]), whereas our entanglement cost corresponds to e.g. (0, E C , 1) or (E C , 0, 1). Some more examples are discussed in [5, Figure 2] and a particularly interesting case is the following. For e = 0, c = 0, and product state inputs, the channel simulation can be done for [5, Theorem 3]\nwith the maximally entangled state between the input and the purifying system, and E P the entanglement of puriﬁcation [39] E P (⇢ AB ) = \t min\n(13) Now one could hope to generalize this to a channel simulation for general input states using the techniques presented above, leading to\nwhere the maximization is over all puriﬁcations   n of input states to the n-fold tensor product quantum channel E ⌦n , and I stands for the identity channel on the purifying system. However, this does not work for same reason as the quantum reverse Shannon theorem can not be proven for general input states using only maximally entangled states; an issue known as entanglement spread [5], [40], [41], [42].\nAnother interesting open question concerns the relation of E C ( E) and Q ! ( E). We know that E C ( E) Q ! ( E), with the inequality typically being strict. Can we obtain a characterization of channels for which E C ( E) = Q ! ( E)? This is an analogue of the problem of characterizing bipartite states for which the distillable entanglement is equal the entanglement cost, which is still wide open.\nNote added. After completion of this work, security in the noisy storage model was linked to the strong converse quantum\ncapacity of the adversary\u2019s storage device [43]. This means that our bound on the strong converse from Section IV-B can also be applied directly to calculate rates for security. However, our arguments from Section IV-A apply to virtually any form of the noisy storage model, whereas the results from [43] are only applicable for the so-called six-state encoding.\nWe acknowledge discussions with Jonathan Oppenheim, Michael Walter, Reinhard Werner, Mark Wilde, and Andreas Winter.
