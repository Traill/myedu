In other words, we study ICSI instances with n receivers for which optimal scalar linear index codes have transmission rates 2, n − 2, n − 1, or n. Consequently, we show that the problem of deciding whether a digraph has min-rank two over F 2 is NP-complete. By contrast, the same decision problem for graphs can be solved in polynomial time. The characterizations of graphs and digraphs with near- extreme min-ranks are summarized in the table below. The star mark indicates that the result is established in this paper.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Basic notations and def- initions are presented in Section II. In Section III, we present characterization of graphs and digraphs of near-extreme min- ranks. In Section IV, we prove the hardness of the decision problem of whether a digraph has min-rank two.

The support of a vector u ∈ F n q is deﬁned to be the set supp (u) = {i ∈ [n] : u i = 0}. For an n × k matrix M , let M i denote the ith row of M . For a set E ⊆ [n], let M E denote the |E| × k sub-matrix of M formed by rows of M which are indexed by the elements of E. For any matrix M over F q , we denote by rank q (M ) the rank of M over F q . We use e i to denote the unit vector, which has a one at the ith position, and zeros elsewhere.\nA graph is a pair G = (V(G), E(G)) where V(G) is the set of vertices of G, and E(G), the edge set, is a set of unordered pairs of distinct vertices of G. A typical edge of G is of the form {i, j} where i, j ∈ V(G), and i = j. For a graph with n vertices, we often take [n] as the vertex set. A digraph\nrequests x 1 owns x 2\nrequests x 5 owns x 2 , x 4\nx 1 + x 2 x 2 + x 3 x 4 + x 5\nThis index code saves two transmissions compared with the na¨ıve approach when S broadcasts all ﬁve messages.\nEach instance of the ICSI problem can be described by the so-called side information digraph [4]. Given n and X i , i ∈ [n], the side information digraph D is deﬁned as follows. The vertex set V(D) = [n]. The arc set E(D) = ∪ i ∈[n] {(i, j) : j ∈ X i }. The side information digraph corresponding to the ICSI instance in Example II.1 is depicted in Fig. 2a.\nDeﬁnition II.2 ([7], [4]). Let D = (V(D), E(D)) be a digraph of order n. A matrix M = (m i,j ) ∈ F n ×n q is said to ﬁt D if m i,i = 0 and m i,j = 0 whenever i = j and (i, j) / ∈ E(D). The min-rank of D over F q , denoted minrk q (D), is deﬁned to be the minimum rank of a matrix in F n ×n q that ﬁts D. Since a graph can be viewed as a special case of a digraph, the above deﬁnitions also apply to a graph.\n3 4 5\n1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\nFig. 2: Corresponding side information digraph (Example II.1) Bar-Yossef et al. [4] showed that the length (transmission\nrate) of an optimal scalar linear index code for the ICSI instance described by D is precisely the min-rank of D. Let β q (t, D) denotes the length of an optimal vector index code of block length t over F q for an ICSI instance described by a di- graph D. Lubetzky et al. [13] deﬁned the broadcast rate β q (D) of the corresponding ICSI instance to be lim t →∞ β q (t, D)/t (see also [14]). Then minrk q (D) is an upper bound on β q (D). Theorem II.3 ([7], [4], [14]). For any digraph D we have α(D) ≤ β q (D) ≤ minrk q (D), where α(D) denotes the size of a maximum acyclic induced subgraph of D. The same inequalities hold for a graph G, where α(G) denotes the size of a maximum independent set of G.\nProposition III.1. A digraph has min-rank one over F q if and only if it is a complete digraph.\nDue to Theorem II.3, it is also trivial to see that β q (D) = 1 if and only if D is a complete digraph.\nIt was observed by Peeters [9] that a graph has min-rank two if and only if it is not a complete graph and its complement is a bipartite graph. We now focus only on digraphs of min-rank two. In this section, only the binary alphabet is considered.\nWe ﬁrst introduce the following concept of a fair coloring of a digraph. Recall that a k-coloring of a graph G = (V(G), E(G)) is a mapping φ : V(G) → [k] which satisﬁes\nProof: Suppose V(D) = [n]. The ONLY IF direction:\nThe following corollary characterizes the digraphs of min- rank two.\nCorollary III.5. A digraph D has min-rank two over F 2 if and only if D is fairly 3-colorable and D is not a complete digraph.\nFor a graph G, it was proved by Blasiak et al. [15] that β 2 (G) = 2 if and only if G is bipartite and G is not a complete graph. A characterization (by forbidden subgraphs) of digraphs D with β 2 (D) = 2 was also obtained therein.\nProposition III.6. Let G be a graph of order n. Then minrk q (G) = n if and only if G has no edges.\nProposition III.7. Let D be a digraph of order n. Then minrk q (D) = n if and only if D is acyclic.\nProof: Equivalently, we show that minrk q (D) ≤ n − 1 if and only if D has a circuit. Let V(D) = [n].\nSuppose D has a circuit C = (i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i r ). We construct a matrix M ﬁtting D as follows. Let V(C) = {i 1 , . . . , i r }. For j / ∈ V(C), let M j = e j . For s ∈ [r−1], let M i s = e i s −e i s+1 . Finally, let M i r = e i 1 − e i r . Clearly, M ﬁts D. Moreover, as\nrank q (M ) = rank q M V(C) + rank q M [n]\\V(C) ≤ (r − 1) + (n − r) = n − 1.\nConversely, suppose that minrk q (D) ≤ n − 1. By Theo- rem II.3, α(D) ≤ n − 1. Therefore, D contains a circuit.\nBy Theorem II.3, it is not hard to see that Proposition III.6 and III.7 also hold if we replace minrk q (·) by β q (·).\nDeﬁnition III.8. A graph G = (V(G), E(G)) is called a star graph if |V(G)| ≥ 2 and there exists a vertex i ∈ V(G) such that E(G) = {i, j} : j ∈ V(G) \\ {i} .\nminrk q (G) ≤ n − mm(G) = n − 2. As α(G) ≤ minrk q (G), it sufﬁces to show that α(G) = n − 2. Let {a, b} and {c, d} be the two edges in a maximum matching in G. Let U = {a, b, c, d} and V = V(G) \\ U . The main idea is to show that we can always ﬁnd two nonadjacent vertices in U which are not adjacent to any vertex in V . Such two vertices can be added to V to obtain an independent set of size n − 2, which establishes the proof.\nIt is also not hard to see that Theorem III.10 still holds with minrk q (·) being replaced by β q (·).\nIn this section, we ﬁrst prove that the decision problem of whether a given digraph is fairly k-colorable (see Deﬁni- tion III.2) is NP-complete, for any given k ≥ 3. The hardness of this problem, by Proposition III.1 and Corollary III.5, leads to the hardness of the decision problem of whether a given digraph has min-rank two over F 2 . The fair k-coloring problem is deﬁned formally as follows.\nTheorem IV.1. The fair k-coloring problem is NP-complete for k ≥ 3.\nProof: This problem is obviously in NP. For NP-hardness, we reduce the k-coloring problem to the fair k-coloring problem. Suppose that G = (V(G), E(G)) is an arbitrary graph. We aim to build a digraph D = (V(D), E(D)) so that G is k- colorable if and only if D is fairly k-colorable. Suppose that V(G) = [n]. For each i ∈ [n], we build the following gadget, which is a digraph D i = (V i , E i ). The vertex set of D i is\na clone (in D i ) of the vertex i j ∈ [n]. The arc set of D i is E i = (ω i,i j , i) : i j ∈ N G (i) .\nAdditionally, we also introduce n new vertices p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n . The digraph D = (V(D), E(D)) is built as follows. The vertex set of D is\nV(D) = ∪ n i =1 V i ∪ {p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n }. Let\np 1 \t p 2 \t p 3 2 \t 3\nOn the other hand, since i j ∈ N G (i), we obtain that φ G (i j ) = φ G (i) = φ D (i).\nHence, if we deﬁne φ G : [n] → [k] by φ G (i) = φ D (i) for all i ∈ [n], then it is a k-coloring of G. Thus G is k-colorable.\nFinally, notice that the order of D is a polynomial with respect to the order of G. More speciﬁcally, |V(D)| = 2|V(G)| + 2|E(G)| and |E(D)| = |V(G)| + 4|E(G)|. Moreover,\nbuilding D from G, and also obtaining a coloring of G from a coloring of D, can be done in polynomial time in |V(G)|. Since the k-coloring problem (k ≥ 3) is NP-hard [16], we conclude that the fair k-coloring problem is also NP-hard.\nCorollary IV.2. Given an arbitrary digraph D, the decision problem of whether minrk 2 (D) = 2 is NP-complete.\nRecall that for a graph G, it was observed by Peeters [9] that G has min-rank two if and only if G is a bipartite graph and G is not a complete graph, which can be veriﬁed in polynomial time. Another related result, presented by Blasiak et al. [15], stated that there is a polynomial time algorithm to verify whether β 2 (D) = 2 for a general digraph D."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"Y.
