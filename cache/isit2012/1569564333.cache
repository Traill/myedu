The MIMO switch carries out precode-and-forward, where all users send their signals in the uplink and then the MIMO switch precodes the received vector signal for broadcasting in the downlink. Ideally, each user employs a receive ﬁlter to recover its desired signal from one other user with no or little interference from other users. We propose a joint design of the precoder and the receive ﬁlters to achieve the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE), assuming full channel state information is available at the relay.

We explore two minimum mean square error (MMSE) relaying schemes: MMSE relaying with and without network coding. We show that compared with the existing zero-forcing (ZF)/MMSE relaying schemes, both of our proposed MMSE schemes achieve better MSE and throughput performances.\nTwo-way relaying has been extensively investigated in re- cent years (see, e.g., [2]\u2013[4]). By applying physical-layer net- work coding (PNC) [5], two half-duplex nodes can accomplish bidirectional information exchange in two phases with the help of a half-duplex relay. Much of the current interest is on general multi-way relay serving multiple users. Capacity bounds for the multi-relay channel where the relay has a single antenna has been developed in [6]. So far, the trafﬁc patterns studied include pairwise data exchange [6]\u2013[8], where the users form pairs to exchange data within each pair, and full data exchange, where each user broadcasts to all other users [6], [9]\u2013[11]. In contrast, the trafﬁc pattern studied in this paper is arbitrary unicast, where the mapping from senders to receivers can be an arbitrary permutation, which is more general than pairwise exchanges.\nSpeciﬁcally, we propose and study a precode-and-forward scheme which improves on our previous work [1], [12]. An ordinary zero-forcing relaying with and without network coding was proposed in [12] to maximize the sum rate under a fairness requirement. The ZF scheme eliminates interference at the expense of elevated noise, which degrades the through- put performance, especially for ill-conditioned channels or low SNR communication. The MMSE precode-and-forward scheme strikes a balance between noise and interference. The MMSE precoder and receive ﬁlter are studied for single- hop transmission in [13]. MMSE relaying schemes were investigated in [8], [11], in which MMSE precoders at the relay are used to minimize the sum MSE of all the users. In contrast, in this paper we introduce receive ﬁlters at the users and show that joint optimization of the relay precoder and the receive ﬁlters can yield signiﬁcantly better MSE results. In addition, we show how network coding can be introduced into the MMSE system to further improve the MSE and throughput performances. Simulation results show that the network-coded MMSE relaying improves the throughput performance over the existing ZF/MMSE relaying schemes noticeably with moderate complexity increase.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the background of wireless MIMO switching. In Section III, the ordinary and network-coded MMSE relaying schemes are proposed. Section IV presents the simulation results. The paper is concluded by Section V.\nConsider K users, numbered 1, . . . , K, each with one antenna, as shown in Fig. 1. The users communicate via a relay with N antennas and there is no direct link between any two users. In this paper, we focus on the pure unicast case, in which each user transmits to one other user only. The collection of unicast patterns can be used to realize any general trafﬁc ﬂow pattern (unicast, multicast, broadcast, or a mixture of them) among the users by scheduling a set of different unicast trafﬁc ﬂows. 1\nEach transmission consists of one uplink symbol interval and one downlink symbol interval. In particular, the two symbol intervals are two slots in a time-division system.\nThe uplink symbol interval is for simultaneous uplink trans- missions from the users to the relay; the downlink symbol interval is for downlink transmissions from the relay to the users. We assume the two intervals are of equal duration. Each round of uplink and downlink transmission realizes a switching permutation, as described below.\nConsider one transmission. Let x = [x 1 , · · · , x K ] T be the vector representing the signals transmitted by the users. Let y = [y 1 , · · · , y N ] T be the received signals at the relay, and u = [u 1 , · · · , u N ] T be the noise vector with indepen- dent identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise samples following circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution, i.e., u n ∼ N c (0, γ 2 ). Then\nwhere H is the uplink channel gain matrix. The relay multi- plies y by a precoding matrix G before relaying the signals. In this paper, we assume that the uplink channel and downlink channel are reciprocal, i.e., the downlink channel is H T . Thus, the received signals at the users in vector form are\nwhere w is the noise vector at the receiver, with the i.i.d. noise samples following CSCG distribution, i.e., w k ∼ N c (0, σ 2 ). We assume the detector at the users is C, where C is diagonal since the users are distributed.\nWe refer to an K × K matrix P that has one and only one nonzero element on each row and each column equal to 1 as a permutation matrix. Evidently, P x is a column vector consisting of the same elements as x but permuted in a certain\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\nthen P x = [x 3 , x 1 , x 2 ] T . In the case where all diagonal elements of P are zero it is also called a derangement. The precoder G realizes a particular permutation represented by the permutation matrix P . Note that a symmetric permuta- tion, i.e., P = P T , realizes a pairwise data exchange. By manipulating G and C, our purpose is to make ˆ r close to P x in some sense. The sum rate is written as (4).\nThe objective of the MMSE relaying scheme is to minimize the sum MSE between the received signals after detection and the transmit signals. In the following, we introduce the design of the detector C and the precoder G.\nGiven a desired permutation P , the optimization problem for determining the optimal precoder and ﬁlter is formulated as\nsubject to \t Tr[GM G H ] ≤ q \t (6b) C is diagonal, \t (6c)\nwhere (6b) is the constraint of relaying power consumption. Unfortunately, the problem is nonconvex, making it difﬁcult to solve both G and C directly. However, we notice that we can solve the two variables in an iterative manner. That is, we can iteratively optimize one variable by somehow ﬁxing the other one until convergence to a local optimum.\nThe iterative formulas can be determined using the La- grangian function, which is written as\nwhere λ ≥ 0 is the Lagrangian multiplier. Suppose all uplink transmissions are independent and use unit average power, i.e., E{x 2 i } = 1, i = 1, · · · , K. We deﬁne\nwhere α is a scaling factor to meet the power constraint at the relay. Plugging (2) and (8) into (7), and setting the derivative w.r.t. ˜ G ∗ to be zero when ˜ C is ﬁxed, we have\n(13) Then we consider the solution of C given G. Let the column\nvector c = diag{C} ∈ C K×1 . The cost function can be rewritten as\ns = diag{P H H G H H ∗ } ∈ C K×1 , \t (15) D = I (H T GM G H H ∗ + σ 2 I) ∈ C K×K , \t (16)\nwhere denotes element-by-element multiplication, i.e., the Hadamard product. We calculate the gradient w.r.t. c, and the optimal solution is then\nRemark 1: Since the iterative algorithm can not guarantee the global optimum, the trick is using the ZF result [1], [12] as the initial condition of this problem. Thus, the MMSE scheme could achieve better MSE and throughput performances than the ZF scheme. 2\nFor the network-coded MMSE relaying, we permit the self- interference to exist at the side of receivers. Then the self- interference can be canceled from the denominator of the SNR in the sum rate (4). As we proposed earlier in [12], we deﬁne a diagonal matrix B to denote the weights of self-interference. We will show that by proper design of B, the throughput\nperformance outperforms that of ordinary MMSE relaying in which B = 0.\nWith network coding, we could cancel the self information from Cr (i.e., Cr − Bx) at the receivers. The square error is then P x − (Cr − Bx) 2 . The optimization problem can be written as\nsubject to \t Tr[GM G H ] ≤ q \t (18b) B and C are diagonal. \t (18c)\nThe problem is nonconvex. However, we can solve G and (B, C) iteratively similarly to the algorithm for solving (6).\nwhere β is a scaling factor to meet the relay power constraint. For ﬁxed (B, ¯ C), setting the derivative w.r.t. ¯ G ∗ to be zero, we have\nFor ﬁxed G, denote the column vectors b = diag{B} ∈ C K×1 , c = diag{C} ∈ C K×1 . The cost function can be rewritten as\ns = diag{P H H G H H ∗ } ∈ C K×1 , \t (24) D 1 = I (H H G H H ∗ ) ∈ C K×K , \t (25) D 2 = I (H T GM G H H ∗ + σ 2 I) ∈ C K×K , \t (26) D 3 = (D 2 − D 1 D H 1 ) 1 2 ∈ C K×K . \t (27)\nLemma 1: The MSE of both the non-PNC and the PNC schemes converge as the number of iterations increases.\nProof: For both the non-PNC and PNC scheme, the MSE decreases monotonically as the number of iteration increases. Together with the MSE being non-negative, we conclude that the MSE converges toward a local optimum.\nIn this section, we evaluate the MSE and the throughputs of the proposed MMSE relaying schemes. We assume the maximum transmit power of the relay is the same as that of each user, i.e., q = 1, and the noise levels at the relay and the users are the same. Our simulations yield essentially the same\ngeneral results for different symmetric (resp. asymmetric) permutations, i.e., pairwise (resp. non-pairwise) information exchange. Thus, we just pick one symmetric permutation P = [e 2 , e 1 , e 4 , e 3 ] and present three results here:\nObservation 1: The proposed MMSE relaying schemes have better MSE performance than the MMSE schemes in [8], [11].\nThe MSE performance is evaluated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4. The sum MSE of the MMSE scheme [8], [11] saturates at high SNR, since they optimize the precoders at the relay only. In contrast, we jointly optimize both the precoder at the relay and the detectors at the users, thus our MSE keeps decreasing. Importantly, the MSE can be further decreased by network coding. Comparing the MSE of different number of users, we see that the sum MSE increases as the number of users grows. Observation 2: The proposed network-coded MMSE relaying scheme generally has better throughput performance than the relaying schemes in [1], [8], [11], [12].\nWe compare our proposed relaying schemes with the ZF schemes in [1], [8], [11], [12], the MMSE scheme in [8], [11] and the network-coded schemes in [11], [12]. The throughput performance is evaluated in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5. For non-PNC schemes, the proposed non-PNC MMSE scheme has similar throughput performance as the MMSE scheme in [8], [11], and they both outperform the non-PNC ZF schemes in [1], [11]. The effect of the receive ﬁlter C in throughput performance is not obvious. By joint optimization with C, the optimal B and G are different from that in the case without C. The gain is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5.\nThe throughput performance can be further improved by network coding. In particular, our proposed network-coded MMSE scheme outperforms our prior network-coded ZF re- laying scheme as well as the network-coded scheme in [11]. Summing up the gains induced by MMSE and network cod- ing, the network-coded MMSE relaying scheme can achieve around 5 dB gain over the traditional ZF/MMSE schemes. In addition, when the number of users grows, the sum rate increases; however, the average rate decreases. Note that the gap between network-coded ZF and MMSE schemes is trivial when N = 2. The reason is that the loss due to zero-forcing disappears after adding B when N = 2, i.e., there is no zero element in P + B. However, when N > 2 the MMSE scheme achieves larger gain over the ZF scheme since the latter forces some elements in P + B to be zero.\nObservation 3: The complexities of the network-coded schemes are close to the non-PNC schemes. The MMSE schemes have higher complexity than the ZF schemes.\nAs mentioned in Remark 1, we initialize the precoders with the ZF results proposed in [1], [12]. The iteration stops when the throughput improvement is smaller than 10 −3 . To evaluate the complexity of our proposed schemes, we ﬁrst evaluate the numbers of iterations required for our proposed MMSE schemes to achieve convergence. Fig. 6 indicates that with the ZF result initialization, the number of iterations decreases as SNR increases, or as the number of users decreases. The network-coded schemes have faster convergence, but little ad- ditional complexity in terms of the number of multiplications needed, as shown in Fig. 6. The comparison results of the numbers of multiplications and additions are similar, thus we show the ﬁgure of multiplication only.\nWe remark that for implementation, the optimization com- putation itself can be performed solely at the relay, with the computed detectors\u2019 gains C and the self-interference weights B conveyed to the users. Since both C and B are diagonal, the amounts of data to be conveyed are not large.\nIn this paper, we have proposed two MMSE relaying schemes in the wireless MIMO switching, i.e., a general multi-way relay channel. The schemes, especially the network- coded scheme has substantially better MSE and throughput performances than the existing ZF/MMSE relaying schemes."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"F.
