Rayleigh fading coherent channel, where the receiver knows the channel state but the transmitter knows only the channel distribution, scales as [1]: 1\nso that, at high signal-to-noise ratio (snr), the potential gain in reliable information transmission rate of a multiple- over a single-antenna system grows (linearly) with the minimum of the number of transmit or receive antennas, min(n t , n r ).\nOf particular relevance has also been the characterization of the capacity of multiple-antenna communications systems that embody prominent channel features that go beyond the canonical model. The crux of the characterizations, which for analytical tractability have been usually pursued in the asymptotic regimes of low and high snr, are afﬁne expansions of the capacity in terms of fundamental performance measures that unveil the effect of various factors such as the number of transmit and receive antennas, antenna correlation, antenna polarization, line-of-sight components, spatially colored noise, interference, or even key signal features, offering thus a more realistic view of the potential of multiple-antenna communi- cations (e.g. see [2], [3], [4]).\nIn this paper, in view of the fact that practical constraints pertaining to the transmission and reception of information often dictate the use of discrete inputs (such as PSK or QAM constellations) in lieu of the ideal capacity achieving Gaussian ones, we study the constrained capacity of multiple-antenna fading coherent channels driven by arbitrary (discrete) inputs. In particular, we focus on the antenna-uncorrelated and the antenna-correlated Rayleigh fading coherent channel and the Ricean fading coherent channel, offering insight and concrete guidelines for signal and system design.\nThe characterization of the constrained capacity of channels driven by non-Gaussian inputs is considerably more complex than the characterization of the channel capacity achieved by Gaussian inputs. We pursue the analysis by leveraging asymptotic expansions of the constrained capacity of fading coeherent channels driven by arbitrary discrete inputs whose origins trace back to the I-MMSE identity [5], [6]. Other applications of the I-MMSE identity [7] also appear in [8], [9], [10], [11]. Due to space limitations, the detailed technical proofs are referred to [6].\nWe consider a fading channel with n t transmit and n r receive antennas which can be modeled as follows:\nfor a single use of the channel, where y ∈ C n r represents the vector of complex receive symbols, x ∈ C n t represents the vector of complex transmit symbols, n ∼ CN (0, I) ∈ C n r is the random noise vector and H ∈ C n r ×n t is the ran- dom channel matrix with unit-power random entries, so that E tr HH \u2020 = n t n r . We take the input to conform to an equiprobable multi-dimensional constellation with cardinality M, i.e., x ∈ {x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x M }, with Σ x = E xx \u2020 = 1 n\nWe also take the input, the noise and the channel to be independent. The parameter snr relates to the signal-to-noise ratio per receive antenna.\nWe consider a channel matrix that incorporates Rayleigh fading, Ricean fading as well as transmit and receive antenna\nwhere H 0 ∈ C n r ×n t is a deterministic matrix, H w ∈ C n r ×n t is a canonical complex Gaussian random matrix with in- dependent zero-mean and unit-variance circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random entries and Θ T ∈ C n t ×n t and Θ R ∈ C n r ×n r are unit-diagonal Hermitian positive semi- deﬁnite matrices with the correlation coefﬁcients between the n t transmit and the n r receive antennas, respectively. The Ricean K-factor K corresponds to the ratio between the deterministic and random component energies. Since the term H 0 corresponds to line-of-sight or diffracted components, H 0 = a R a \u2020 T where the vectors a T ∈ C n t and a R ∈ C n r are associated with the transmit and receive array responses to a plane wave so that a T 2 = n t and a R 2 = n r . 2\nWe assume that the receiver knows the channel matrix realization and that the transmitter knows only the channel matrix distribution. We also assume that the sequence of random channel matrices over time is stationary and ergodic. Consequently, the constrained capacity, achieved by coding over multiple fading blocks, is given by:\nC (snr) = E H I x; √ snr · Hx + n H \t (4) where I x;\nsnr · Hx + n conditioned on a realization of the channel matrix H.\nWe pursue an asymptotic characterization of the constrained capacity exclusively. In particular, we concentrate on the asymptotic regime of high snr, because the behavior of the capacity associated with Gaussian inputs is identical to the behavior of the constrained capacity associated with arbitrary proper complex inputs in the asymptotic regime of low snr [2].\nWe build upon the high-snr characterization of the con- strained capacity of multiple-antenna fading coherent channels driven by arbitrary discrete inputs in [5], [6]. A key element of the characterization is the squared Euclidean distance between the (noiseless) receive vectors Hx i and Hx j associated with the transmit vectors x i and x j given by:\nd 2 ij and the higher-order derivatives p (n) d 2\nd 2 ij , n = 1, 2, . . . Let us deﬁne the integer d ≥ 1 as follows:\n   \n  \n   \n  \nThe following Theorem deﬁnes the high-snr behavior of the constrained capacity when the probability density function of the squared pairwise Euclidean distance between (noiseless) receive vectors and the higher-order derivatives obey some smothness properties, i.e., p (n) d 2\nd 2 ij , n = 0, 1, 2, . . . are con- tinuous and integrable in [0, ∞).\nTheorem 1: In the regime of high-snr, the constrained ca- pacity of a multiple-antenna fading coherent channel driven by arbitrary equiprobable discrete inputs can be expanded as follows:\nwhere d (snr) is a piecewise inﬁnitely differentiable function such that:\nin the interval [snr 0 , ∞) for a sufﬁciently high value of snr 0 and\n= 2 M\nThe availability of the distribution of the pairwise Euclidean distances, which is simple to compute in view of the fact that (5) is a quadratic form in Gaussian random variables for the most common fading channel models, paves the way to the characterization of the constrained capacity via Theorem 1. The resulting expansions enable one to articulate about the impact on the constrained capacity of certain system parameters. 3\nIt is now relevant to characterize the constrained capacity of the canonical i.i.d. Rayleigh fading coherent channel with arbitrary equiprobable discrete inputs in the regime of high snr. The objective is to understand the effect on the constrained capacity of various system parameters, such as the number of transmit antennas, the number of receive antennas as well as the characteristics of the signalling scheme.\nThe following Theorem unveils the high-snr behavior of the constrained capacity. We represent the squared pairwise Euclidean distance between two arbitrary transmit vectors x i and x j by ¯ d 2 ij = x i − x j 2 .\nTheorem 2: In the regime of high-snr, the constrained capacity of the canonical i.i.d. multiple-transmit\u2013multiple- receive antenna Rayleigh fading coherent channel with arbi- trary equiprobable discrete inputs obeys:\n1 ¯ d 2\n1 ¯ d 2\nare given by (9) and (10), respectively. Proof Outline: The result follows immediately from\nthe probability density function of the pairwise Euclidean distances between (noiseless) receive vectors given by:\nd 2 ij = \t 1 ¯ d 2\nTheorem 2 deﬁnes the impact of the number of transmit and receive antennas as well as the characteristics of the signalling scheme on the constrained capacity of the canonical i.i.d. Rayleigh fading coherent channel with arbitrary equiprobable discrete inputs, in the regime of high snr. In particular, in view of the bounds in (12), this Theorem is consistent with the fact that constellations with poor sphere-packing properties require more signal-to-noise ratio than constellation with good sphere-packing properties in order to achieve a certain target constrained capacity in the regime of high snr.\nThe number of receive antennas controls the rate at which the constrained capacity value tends to its inﬁnite-snr value, so that a multiple-receive antenna system requires less signal- to-noise ratio than a single-receive antenna system in order to achieve a certain target constrained capacity in the regime of high snr. The number of transmit antennas, as opposed to its effect on the capacity of the canonical i.i.d. multiple-antenna Rayleigh fading coherent channel [1], does not affect directly the multiplexing ability of the system because the inﬁnite-snr constrained capacity value depends solely on the number of constellation points or vectors. Instead, a higher-dimensional (complex) space, in comparison to a lower-dimensional one, enables the construction of more efﬁciently packed multi- dimensional constellations. This, in view of the bounds in (12), suggests that a multiple-transmit antenna system requires potentially less signal-to-noise ratio than a single-transmit antenna system in order to achieve a certain target constrained capacity in the regime of high snr. Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate that the asymptotic expansions capture this behavior.\nWe now examine the behaviour of the high-snr constrained capacity of antenna-correlated Rayleigh fading coherent chan- nels driven by arbitrary discrete inputs. We write ∆ ij =\n(x i − x j )(x i − x j ) \u2020 . We denote the eigenvalue decomposi- tion of the positive semi-deﬁnite matrix Θ 1/2 T ∆ ij Θ \u2020/2 T by\n, where W T ij is a unitary matrix and Λ T ij = diag λ T ij , 0, . . . , 0 is a diagonal matrix with at most a single non-zero diagonal element λ T ij ≥ 0 (note that there is at most a single non-zero diagonal element λ T ij ≥ 0 because the matrix Θ 1/2 T ∆ ij Θ \u2020/2 T is at most unit rank). We also denote the eigenvalue decomposition of the pos- itive semi-deﬁnite matrix Θ R by Θ R = W R Λ R W \u2020 R , where W R is a unitary matrix and Λ R = diag λ R k is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements λ R k ≥ 0, k = 1, . . . , n r .\nThe following Theorem, which represents a generalization of Theorem 2, deﬁnes the high-snr behavior of the constrained capacity of antenna-correlated Rayleigh fading coherent chan- nels. The Theorem concentrates on non-degenerate scenarios where λ T ij > 0, ∀ i = j, and λ R k > 0, ∀ k. 4\ncapacity of the n r × n t antenna-correlated Rayleigh fading coherent channel with arbitrary equiprobable discrete inputs obeys:\nand k LB nr and k U B nr are given by (9) and (10), respectively. Proof Outline: The result follows immediately from the\nfor d 2 ij ≥ 0 when the eigenvalues of the receive correlation matrix are all equal or [6]\nfor d 2 ij ≥ 0, when the eigenvalues of the receive correlation matrix are all distinct, together with Theorem 1.\nIn general, the bounds in (15) suggest that the constrained capacity of a Rayleigh fading channel with transmit and re- ceive antenna correlation is lower than the constrained capacity of a Rayleigh fading channel without antenna correlation for a certain signal-to-noise ratio in the regime of high snr. This is due to the fact that the value of the bounds in the correlated scenario in (15) is higher than the value of the bounds in the uncorrelated scenario in (12). For example, in the presence of receive antenna correlation, it is possible to show that\ndue to the fact that the function n r k=1 1/λ R k is Schur-convex and the vector λ R 1 λ R 2 · · · λ R nr majorizes the vector [1 1 · · · 1]. In the presence of transmit antenna correlation, it is possible to show that the convex function\nis minimized by Θ T = I in the set of unit-diagonal positive semi-deﬁnite matrices Θ T . This result assumes that the indi- vidual transmit antennas are driven by identical equiprobable\n1 ¯ d 2\nFigure 3 demonstrates that the asymptotic expansions cap- ture this behavior.\nWe now examine the behaviour of the high-snr constrained capacity of Ricean fading coherent channels driven by arbi- trary discrete inputs. 5 We also write ∆ ij = (x i −x j )(x i −x j ) \u2020 . We denote the eigenvalue decomposition of the positive semi- deﬁnite matrix ∆ ij by ∆ ij = W ij Λ ij W \u2020 ij , where W ij is a unitary matrix and Λ ij = diag λ ij , 0, · · · , 0 is a diagonal matrix with a single non-zero diagonal element λ ij = tr (Λ ij ) = tr (∆ ij ) = tr (x i − x j )(x i − x j ) \u2020 =\nThe following Theorem, which also represents a general- ization of Theorem 2, deﬁnes the high-snr behavior of the constrained capacity of Ricean fading coherent channels.\nTheorem 4: In the regime of high-snr, the constrained ca- pacity of the n r × n t Ricean fading coherent channel with arbitrary equiprobable discrete inputs obeys:\nsnr n r +1 \t (21) where\n1 ¯ d 2\n1 ¯ d 2\nProof Outline: The result follows immediately from the probability density function of d 2 ij given by:\n· tr H 0 W ij e 1 e \u2020 1 W \u2020 ij H \u2020 0 , e k is a unit vector with the kth entry equal to one and the other entries equal to zero, and I n (·) is the nth-order modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst- kind.\nIn general, the bounds in (22) suggest that the constrained capacity of a Ricean fading channel is normally higher than the constrained capacity of the canonical i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel for a certain signal-to-noise ratio in the regime of high snr. This is due to the fact that the function\n1 ¯ d 2\n1 ¯ d 2\nis monotonically decreasing in the K-factor K provided that tr a T \u2020 W ij e 1 e \u2020 1 W \u2020 ij a T ≥ 1, ∀ i = j.\nHowever, and in contrast to the capacity of a multiple- antenna Ricean fading channel [12], the constrained capacity of a Ricean fading channel can also be lower than the constrained capacity of a Rayleigh fading channel for a certain signal-to-noise ratio in the regime of high snr. This aspect is illustrated further with two examples.\nExample 1: Consider a 2 × 2 Ricean fading channel with two equiprobable discrete inputs x 1 = [1 0] T and x 2 = [0 1] T , where H = \t K K+1 · H 0 + \t 1 K+1 · H w and H 0 = a R a T \u2020 with a R = [1 1] T and a T = [1 1] T . Then,\nExample 2: Consider a 2 × 2 Rayleigh fading channel with the two equiprobable discrete inputs x 1 = [1 0] T and x 2 = [0 1] T , where H = H w . Then,\nExamples 1 and 2 suggest that, due to the bounds in (25) and (26), for K > 0 this Ricean fading channel needs a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the Rayleigh fading channel, in order to achieve a certain target constrained capacity in the regime of high snr. Figure 4, which shows only the simulated constrained\ncapacity, conﬁrms this behavior. This is due to the fact that one cannot rely on the deterministic component but rather, in comparison to a canonical i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel, on the lower power random component in order to distinguish the transmit vectors. Note that the transmit vector differences x 1 − x 2 = [1 − 1] T and x 2 − x 1 = [−1 1] T are orthogonal to the transmit array response a T = [1 1] T .\nThe author acknowledges fruitful discussions with Sergio Verd´u."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"I.
