Harada et al. [12] deﬁned the stronger security requirement (called the strong security) on the weakly secure network coding than Bhattad et al.\u2019s one. They deﬁned the strong security as the one that requires the mutual informa- tion between any r elements of (S 1 , . . . , S l ) and information symbols obtained from any µ = n − r wiretapped links in the network being always zero. They proposed a coding scheme attaining the strong security. However, both schemes [2] and [12] depend on the network topology and coding at intermediate nodes, and the computational complexity of code construction is large. Cai [4] proved that random linear network coding over suﬃciently large ﬁelds attains the strong security with arbitrarily high probability, but it is impractical due to network coding over huge ﬁelds and inapplicable to non-random one.\nIn order to solve these problems, Silva et al. [21] proposed a coding scheme that attains the strong security [12] inde- pendently from network code construction. Their scheme can be applied to underlying any (even random) linear network codes. Hence it is called universal. As [22], their scheme uses Ozarow-Wyner coset coding scheme [19] based on maximum rank distance (MRD) codes [11]. They showed only the existence of their scheme for l > 2, and gave an explicit construction only for l = 1, 2. As mentioned in [21, Section V], the explicit construction of such an eﬃcient scheme for arbitrary l still remains an open question. On the other hand, Matsumoto et al. [17] proposed another universal scheme that attains the strong security. However, to attain the strong security, the network must transport packets of large size. Their scheme is less eﬃcient than Silva et al.\u2019s one with respect to required packet size.\nThis paper gives an explicit construction of universal strongly secure scheme using MRD codes, and solves the open question about an explicit construction of universal strongly secure scheme in [21]. Unlike [21], [22], our scheme uses secret sharing schemes [3], [20] based on MRD codes. Our scheme can be viewed as a special case of Ozarow-Wyner coset coding scheme [19] and that of nested coset coding schemes [23]. Also, our scheme can be viewed as a gener- alization of Nishiara et al.\u2019s secret sharing scheme [18] using Reed-Solomon codes, to network coding. Our assumption is\nII. Preliminary A. Basic notations\nAs in [2], [6], [12], [21], [22], we consider a multicast communication network represented by a directed multigraph with unit capacity links, a single source node, and multiple sink nodes. In this paper, we call elements of a column vector space F m× 1 q as packets. Assume that each link in the network can carry an element of F q per one time slot, and that each link transports single packet over m time slots without delays, erasures, or errors.\nWe assume that F q -linear network coding [14] is employed over the network. In the network, the source node produces n packets X 1 , . . . , X n ∈ F m× 1 q . Then, the source node transmits m × n matrix X = [X 1 , . . . , X n ] ∈ F m×n q from n outgoing links to sink nodes through the network, where each outgoing link transports each column of X. The packet transmitted on any link in the network can be represented as an F q -linear combination of packets X 1 , . . . , X n . Namely, the information transmitted on a link e in the network can be denoted as b e X T ∈ F 1×m q , where the coeﬃcient vector b e ∈ F n q is called global coding vector (GCV) of e. Constructing a network code is equivalent to determining the GCV of each link by setting the coeﬃcients of the linear combination performed at each node.\nThe network code is called feasible if each sink node can recover X. We will say that the network is an (n, m, F q )- linear network [21] if it uses an F q -linear network code that is feasible for the transmission of n packets of length m. Clearly, this achieves if and only if a matrix consisting of GCV\u2019s of incoming links to each sink node has rank n.\nThis section presents the wiretap network model [6], [22] which introduces a wiretapper in the setup of Section II-C. From now on, only one sink node is assumed without loss of generality.\nFirst ﬁx l with 1 ≤ l ≤ n, as the number of packets con- taining a secret message. Let S = [S 1 , . . . , S l ], S i ∈ F m× 1 q , be the secret message, and assume that S 1 , . . . , S l are uniformly distributed over F m× 1 q and mutually independent. The source node wishes to transmit S to the sink node in such a way that the secret message S does not leak to the wiretapper. At the source node, S is ﬁrst encoded to n packets X 1 , . . . , X n ∈ F m× 1 q , and then X = [X 1 , . . . , X n ] ∈ F m×n q is transmitted through the network as described in Section II-C.\nThe sink node receives n packets Y ∈ F m×n q as Y T = AX T ∈ F n×m q , where A ∈ F n×n q is the matrix constructed by appending the GCV\u2019s of the incoming links to the sink node.\nLet W be the set of |W| = µ links in the network, intercepted by the wiretapper. Then the packets W ∈ F m×µ q\nobserved by the wiretapper are given by W T = BX T , where B ∈ F µ×n q is the matrix whose rows are the GCV\u2019s associated with the links in W. We allow W to be any set of µ links in the network.\nThen the deﬁnition of the strong security for secure com- munication over the network is given as follows.\nIV. The universal strongly secure scheme A. Description of the proposed scheme\nand obtain X = [C l+ 1 , . . . , C l+n ] ∈ F n q m by puncturing the codeword [C 1 , . . . , C l+n ] = [S , X] ∈ D 1 , where R ∈ F n−l q m is a random vector chosen uniformly at random and independently from S . On the other hand, a sink node receives packets Y T = AX T as described in Section III, and recover S by computing X T = A −1 Y T and executing the erasure decoding operation of the MRD code D 1 on X.\nOur coding scheme presented above is called the secret sharing scheme based on linear codes [7], [16], where secret sharing [3], [20] is a process of encoding a secret S into a set of n pieces of information segments (called shares). Namely, each component C i ∈ F q m of X = [C l+ 1 , . . . , C l+n ] in our coding scheme can be regarded as a share generated from S in the secret sharing scheme based on a systematic MRD code. Consider the case where D 1 is not an MRD code but a Reed- Solomon code in the above settings. Then this secret sharing scheme becomes Nishiara et al.\u2019s one [18]. Similarly to the relation between the wiretap channel II and secure network coding, our scheme can be viewed as a generalization of their scheme [18] for network coding.\nFor a subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , N} and a vector c = [c 1 , . . . , c N ] ∈ F N q m , let P J (c) be a vector of length |J| over F q m , obtained by removing the t-th components c t for t J . For example for J = {1, 3} and c = [1, 1, 0, 1] (N = 4), we have P J (c) = [1, 0]. The punctured code P J (C) of a code C ∈ F N q n is given by\nWe deﬁne punctured codes C 1 P X (D 1 ) and C 2 P X (D 2 ) to the index set X {l + 1, . . . , l + n} in our coding scheme. Note that we have C 1 ⊃ C 2 , and let C 1 /C 2 denote the quotient space. Then, the generation of X stated above can be redescribed by using C 1 , C 2 as follows. The message S is mapped to the coset ψ(S ) P X (S ∆G) + C 2 ∈ C 1 /C 2 by the mapping ψ : F l q m → C 1 /C 2 determined by ∆G. The vector X ∈ F n q m is chosen uniformly at random from ψ(S ). This implies that our secret sharing scheme can be viewed as a case of nested coset coding schemes [23] with C 1 , C 2 , which is a generalization of Ozarow- Wyner coset coding scheme [19]. We shall explain that our scheme is, moreover, a special case of Ozarow-Wyner coset coding scheme in Section IV-C1.\nThis section demonstrates that our scheme achieves the universal strong security deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.\nFor a subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , N}, the shortened code C J of a code C ⊂ F N q m is deﬁned by\nFor example for C = {[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]} (N = 3) and J = {2, 3}, we have C J = {[0, 0], [1, 1]}.\nNow we introduce the following theorem showing the security of the proposed scheme given in Section IV-A.\nTheorem 4. For an arbitrary index i ∈ {1, . . . , l}, let {i} = {1, . . . , l + n}\\{i}. And let Z {i} = P {i} (C) =\n= H (S i ) − H(S i |DZ T {i} ) = 1 − H(S i , Z {i} |DZ T\ncan be viewed as a vector chosen uniformly at random from the coset P {i} (S i T i ) + G 2,i ∈ G 1,i /G 2,i for each i ∈ {1, . . . , l}. This implies that Z {i} can be viewed as a vector generated by a nested coset coding scheme with G 1,i , G 2,i . From [23, Proof of Lemma 4.2], we thus have\nRecall that the number ω of rows of D is ω ≤ n − 1, and that H 2,i is a parity check matrix of an [l + n − 1, n − 1] MRD code G 2,i . Hence, from [22, Theorem 5], we have\n= l + rank F qm D. \t (11) Also, since H 1,i is a submatrix of H 2,i , we have\n= l − 1 + rank F qm D. \t (12) Thus, by substituting Eqs.(11), (12) into Eqs.(9), (10), we ﬁnally have\nThis theorem clariﬁes that, in our scheme, any one element of S 1 , . . . , S l does not leak out even if the wiretapper observes any n−1 symbols of F q -linear combination obtained from other l − 1 secret elements and n elements of X.\nTheorem 5. The scheme given in Section IV-A attains the universal strong security given by Deﬁnition 2.\nProof: First, H(S |Y) = 0 in Eq.(3) is obvious, because the underlying network coding is feasible and the MRD code D 1 is also an MDS code with d(D 1 ) = l + 1.\nNext consider Eq.(4). Let B ∈ F µ×n q (1 ≤ µ ≤ n − 1) be an arbitrary matrix over the base ﬁeld F q . Let Z ⊂ {1, . . . , l} be an arbitrary index set with |Z| ≤ n − µ. For each i ∈ Z, deﬁne a matrix E i ∈ F (|Z|−1)×(l−1) q \t that consists of |Z| − 1 rows of an (l − 1) × (l − 1) identity matrix, satisfying\n= H (S i |S Z\\{i} ) − H(S i |BX T , S Z\\{i} ) = I (S i ; BX T |S Z\\{i} ),\n1) Relation to Ozarow-Wyner coset coding scheme [19]: We ﬁrst give the following proposition.\nthat satisﬁes Deﬁnition 2 whenever m ≥ l + n. Furthermore, we always have l + n < (l + n) 2 /8 + log q 16l for l ≥ 1 and n ≥ 2. Therefore, our condition for the packet length is less demanding than that of Silva et al.\u2019s.\nThe authors would like to thank anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of this paper.
