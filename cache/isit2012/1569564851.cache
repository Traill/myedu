However, the main challenge in dynamic spectrum access is that secondary users are required to accurately detect and rapidly access the idle spectrum, without causing harmful interference to primary radio transmissions [2].\nThe secondary users can have more than one frequency band (channel) to sense and to decide on which channel is suitable for data transmission [3]. However, when a large number of channels is open for cognitive users to opportunistically access, it is energy-inefﬁcient or even infeasible due to hard- ware limitations to simultaneously or continuously sense all available channels. In contrast, if the secondary user chooses one or a subset of possible channels to sense and access at a time, it is crucial for efﬁcient opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) to design a channel selection strategy for the spectrum sensing, leading to ﬁnd an idle channel as quickly as possible. Therefore, in a dilemmatic situation such as energy- limited applications with a large number of channels, it is of great importance for the cognitive user to resourcefully utilize available energy for exploration and exploitation. In fact, such an exploration\u2013exploitation tradeoff is the essence of the bandit problems [4].\nIn this paper, applying the probably approximation correct (PAC) multi-armed bandit problem (MABP) formulation for the active sensing OSA problem, we treat an optimal en- ergy allocation for sensing, probing, and data transmission to maximize the achievable average throughput of the secondary\nuser. This optimal energy balancing between exploration and exploitation can be cast as a fundamental decision-making problem on how many channels should be chosen to sense and probe with dedicated energy\u2014namely, how much pure explo- ration is required for the active sensing OSA bandit problem. Speciﬁcally, taking into account independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel fading over both channels and time blocks, we put forth a proactive strategy for determining the optimal sensing cardinality (the number of channels chosen to sense) and probing cardinality (the number of channels chosen to probe) that maximize the average throughput of the secondary user with limited available frame energy.\nWe consider an energy-limited wideband cognitive radio network, where N ch frequency bands (channels) are modeled by doubly block fading, i.e, block fading in time and in frequency.\nEach channel has the same bandwidth and experiences i.i.d. ﬂat Rayleigh fading. The fading coefﬁcient of each channel remains constant within a block of coherence time T c and changes independently from one block to the other. Therefore, the Rayleigh-fading coefﬁcients remain constant for each block of T c time interval and mutually independent across different blocks and channels. Using a hierarchical access structure with spectrum overlay, each channel is licensed to the primary users while the secondary users have opportunistic access to it. We model the primary spectrum occupancy in each channel according to an independent Bernoulli process with two states, namely, \u201c0 (idle)\u201d and \u201c1 (busy)\u201d states. The spectrum occupancy state is kept ﬁxed in each frame of T f time interval (or L coherence blocks, i.e., T f = LT c ) and changes independently in the next frame, as in [5]\u2013[7]. Let Õ i be the probability that the ith channel is in the busy state for each frame, which is known a priori to the secondary user. Then, the spectrum occupancy state of the ith channel obeys the Bernoulli process ÖÒ ( Õ i ) over frames. 1 We rearrange the statistics Õ i \u2019s in increasing order as Õ [1] ≤ Õ [2] ≤ . . . ≤ Õ [ N sub ] .\nIn each frame, the secondary user chooses a set of best channels in terms of the statistics Õ i \u2019s to sense, which is re- ferred to as the spectrum sensing set S ⊆ C = {1, 2, . . . , N ch } and its cardinality |S| as the sensing cardinality. After sensing these channels with energy consumption E s , the secondary user determines a set of channels sensed as idle in S, denoted by S idle ⊆ S. For active sensing, the secondary user chooses a set of best channels (again in terms of the statistics Õ i \u2019s) in S idle , which is referred to as the spectrum probing set P ⊆ S idle and its cardinality |P| as the probing cardinality. Then, for every coherence block of frame, consuming the probing energy E p , the secondary user probes channels in P to access the best channel for data transmission. Note that for a singleton probing set ( |P| = 1), the secondary user has access to the channel in |P| without probing it (E p = 0 ).\nTo prolong network lifetime without energy depletion and limit network interference caused by the secondary users, the energy E tot per frame is dedicated for sensing, probing and data transmission. Under this energy constraint E tot , the secondary user attempts to optimally allocate a part of the energy for sensing and probing while using the remaining energy for data transmission. If the ith channel is chosen to access for data transmission during the sensing and probing phases, the secondary user transmits data with power P over this chosen channel in the corresponding time block and the received signal over the ith channel can be expressed as\n(1) where su is the transmitted signal from the secondary user with E | su | 2 = 1 ; pu is the primary signal with E | pu | 2 = 1 ; À i ∼ CN (0, 1) and i ∼ CN (0, 1) are Rayleigh-fading channel coefﬁcients from the secondary and primary users to the secondary receiver, respectively; and Ï ∼ CN (0, 1) is the complex additive white Gaussian noise. The quantities ËÆÊ 1 and ËÆÊ 2 denote the average received signal-to-noise ratios at the secondary receiver for the secondary and primary signals, respectively. Note that the second case in (1) corresponds to the miss detection of the primary signal, which is likely to happen at a low level of the primary signal at the secondary transmitter in typical spectrum sensing. Due to limited available frame energy, we ﬁx the secondary transmission power in both probing and data transmission phases such that the interference power at the primary receiver is controlled to be small for this miss detection case. We further consider the following channel state information (CSI) model at the secondary transceiver pair: i) the transmitter does not know all the channel coefﬁcients À i , i ∈ C, at all; ii) before identifying an access channel, the receiver knows only the phases of channel coefﬁcients À i , i ∈ P, at least for active sensing; and iii) with channel training after access decision making, the receiver has perfect CSI on the channel chosen to access.\nLet Ô f and Ô m be the false alarm probability and miss detec- tion probability of the secondary user for detecting the primary spectrum occupancy of each channel. Then, the probability that the ith channel is sensed to be idle is given by\ni (idle) = (1 − Ô f ) (1 − Õ i ) + Ô m Õ i . \t (2) If the ith channel is chosen to access, the secondary user achieves a data rate in nats/s/Hz as\n| i | 2 , \t (3) where ψ i = Ô m Õ i / Ô i (idle) denotes the probability that the ith channel is occupied by the primary user, conditioned on the event that the secondary user senses this channel to be idle. Note that for ËÆÊ 2 | i | 2 1 , we have\ni ≈ ln 1 + ËÆÊ 1 | À i | 2 , \t (4) which is equal to the achievable rate for ideal perfect sensing ( Ô f = Ô m = 0 ).\nDeﬁnition 1 (Sensing Energy Figure): Let E 0 be the energy cost per channel for sensing, called the unit sensing energy. Then, the sensing energy ﬁgure (SEF), denoted by ζ ∈ [0, 1], is deﬁned as the ratio between the unit sensing energy and frame energy, that is, ζ = E 0 /E tot .\nDeﬁnition 2 (Transmission Energy Figure): The transmis- sion energy ﬁgure (TEF), denoted by η ∈ [0, 1], is deﬁned as the ratio between total data transmission energy and frame energy, that is, η = 1 − (E s + LE p ) /E tot .\nDeﬁnition 3 (Average Regularity Throughput): Let R be the achievable average rate (nats/s/Hz) of the secondary user for data transmission with transmit power P in each frame. Then, the average regularity throughput as a function of the TEF η is deﬁned as Ê rt (η) = ηR nats/s/Hz.\nFor channel probing, the secondary user attempts to test channels in the probing set P using the ( , δ, α, β, A)-PAC MEA [8]. In the probing phase, the secondary user sends the sequence of unit-energy testing signals X test over each channel in P for channel probing, where X test ∈ {1, −1} is a binary phase-shift keying signal known to the receiver. Then, in the presence of phase CSI, the receiver duplicates X test using the maximum-likelihood detection, i.e., ˆ i = arg min X∈{1,−1} | Î i − X À i | 2 for the ith channel, i ∈ P, and declares error if ˆ i = X test , where Î i is the received signal for the test X test over the ith channel and À i is the channel tracking coefﬁcient, which has the unit amplitude and the same phase as the channel À i . By counting errors in each channel, the receiver generates a set of channels for the next stage in the ( , δ, α , β , P)-PAC MEA and feedbacks it to the secondary. By letting ˘ i , ˘ X test ∈ {0, 1} be the demodulated\nversions of ˆ i and X test respectively, conditioned on | À i | and | i |, we can model these test communications over the ith channel as a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability Ô test ,i = Q √ 2 | À i | , if the ith channel is in the idle state, and otherwise\n2 | À i | 2 1 +\nfor every test, namely, ˘ i = ˘ X test ⊕ ÖÒ Ô test ,i , where ⊕ denotes Boolean addition and Q (z) is the Gaussian tail probability.\nIn this ( , δ, α , β , P)-PAC MEA for channel probing, we set the (Bernoulli) reward © i for the ith channel as © i = 1 if\ni = 0 otherwise. Then, by the algorithm, we choose the -optimal channel such that\n< Ô test ,i + > 1 − δ. (5) C. Sensing and Probing Cardinalities\nSince the secondary user tests each channel in P using the unit-energy test X test and the ( , δ, α , β , P)-PAC MEA, we can bound the probing energy E p as\nTheorem 1: Let P (|S idle |) ⊆ S idle be the feasible probing set for given |S idle | such that\n|P (|S idle |)| ∈ {1, 2, . . . , t max ( |S|, |S idle |)} , where\n⎧ ⎪ ⎨\n⎫ ⎪ ⎬\n(8) Then, the achievable regularity throughput (nats/s/Hz) for the secondary user subject to the energy constraint E tot for sensing, probing, and data transmission is bounded by\n(9) with\nwhere S n ⊆ S with |S n | = n, Ô i (busy) = 1 − Ô i (idle) , and E n (z) is the nth-order exponential integral function.\nProof: See Appendix A. Theorem 2: Let\nL j = {n ∈ N : log 2 n = j, n ≤ t max ( |S|, |S idle |)} , j = 0, 1, . . . , log 2 t max ( |S|, |S idle |)\nbe the jth subset of feasible probing cardinalities. Then, Ξ (ζ, |S|, |P (|S idle |)|) |P(|S idle |)| is a concave function in |P (|S idle |)| ∈ L j and hence, we have the locally optimal car- dinality that maximizes Ξ (ζ, |S|, |P (|S idle |)|) |P(|S idle |)| in the jth subset such that\nwhich can be readily determined since L j is the ﬁnite set of integers.\nUsing Theorem 2, the optimal probing cardinality for given |S idle | can be determined by the following procedure.\nAlgorithm 1 (Optimal Probing Cardinality): The optimal probing cardinality for given |S idle | can be determined by the following procedure:\n1. Set the subsets of feasible probing cardinalities L j , j = 0, 1, . . . , log 2 t max ( |S|, |S idle |) .\n2. Find the locally optimal cardinality |P (|S idle |)| j for each subset L j using Theorem 2.\n3. Find the optimal cardinality as |P (|S idle |)| = arg max\nUsing the optimal probing cardinality |P (|S idle |)| obtained by Algorithm 1 for given |S idle |, we can determine the sensing cardinality that maximizes the upper bound (9) on the average regularity throughput under the energy constraint E tot for sensing, probing, and data transmission as follows:\nE |S idle | Ξ ζ, |S|, |P (|S idle |)| |P(|S idle |)| , (14)\nwhich can be again readily determined since C is the ﬁnite set of integers.\nFor passive sensing without any probing mechanism to assess the quality of channels in S idle , the secondary user chooses a channel with the smallest Õ i in S idle to access for data transmission. This policy can be viewed as a special case of active sensing with a singleton probing set ( |P| = 1) at the TEF η = 1 − ζ|S|. Therefore, using Theorem 1 with |P (|S idle |)| = 1, we get the achievable regularity throughput for passive sensing at η = 1 − ζ|S| as follows:\nwhere i is given by [9, eq. (6)] and the inequality in (9) is not necessary since E p = Σ (1) = 0 . Note that (15) agrees with [9, Lemma 1] and the optimal sensing cardinality in (14) reduces to [9, Theorem 1].\nIn this section, we provide some numerical results to demonstrate the effect of optimal energy allocation in the active sensing OSA. In all examples, we set N ch = 100 ,\ndB, ËÆÊ 2 = −10 dB , E 0 = 50000 energy units, L = 10, Ô m = 0.1, and Ô f = 0.1. In the ( , δ, α , β , P)-PAC MEA for channel probing, we set = 0.1 and δ = 0.1. For this correctness policy, we set the values of α and β to the asymptotically optimal pair (α = 0.8038, β = 0.7739).\nFig. 1 shows the average regularity throughput Ê rt (η) as a function of spectrum occupancy heterogeneity θ when\nrt (η) increases (but not signiﬁcantly) as the primary spectrum occupancy becomes more heterogeneous among channels (i.e., θ increases). This is due to that fact that the secondary user chooses a set of channels with low occupancy history Õ i for sensing and probing. At low ËÆÊ 2 , we see again that the upper bound (9) is still tight and agrees almost exactly with the simulation result for the heterogeneous case. Fig. 2 shows Ê rt (η) as a function of ζ for ËÆÊ 2 = −10 dB and heterogeneous occupancy Õ i = 0.75 + 0.005 (i − 50). The optimal active sensing keeps the throughput advantage for the heterogeneous occupancy Õ i \u2019s by optimally balancing the energy for sensing, probing, and data transmission.\nIn this paper, we investigated the optimal energy allocation for energy-constrained active cognitive radios. Using the PAC MABP formulation, we presented the OSA policy with optimal active sensing, which enables the cognitive user to optimally balance available frame energy between exploration (sensing and probing) and exploitation (data transmission). Specif- ically, reﬁning the ( , δ)-PAC action elimination algorithm for channel probing, we put forth the proactive strategy for determining the optimal sensing and probing cardinalities that maximize the throughput of the secondary user with limited available frame energy. This optimal active sensing achieves\na considerable throughput gain over (even optimal) passive sensing, by cultivating the diversity yet preserving residual energy for data transmission.\nThis work was supported by the Korea Research Founda- tion(KRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST)\nThis research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation under Grant ECCS-0901034, the Ofﬁce of Naval Research under Grant N00014-11-1-0397, and MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies.\nIt follows from (6) that the TER η is upper-bounded by Ξ (ζ, |S|, |P (|S idle |)|) for given |S idle |.Therefore, letting i = | À i | 2 , we have\n{Ξ (ζ, |S|, |P (|S idle |)|) E { Á }} \t (16) ≤ E |S idle | {Ξ (ζ, |S|, |P (|S idle |)|) E { i }} (17)\nwhere (16) follows from (6); (17) follows from the -optimality of the algorithm; and the last inequality (18) is attained by perfect sensing. To evaluate |P(|S\n|)| , we let max = max i∈P(|S idle |) i . Then, we can obtain the CDF of Z max as\n[1 − F max (z)] dz. (20) From (20), we obtain |P(|S\n|)|) is a linearly decreasing and nonnegative function in |P (|S idle |)| ∈ L j . Therefore, it sufﬁces to show that |P(|S\n|)| ∈ L j in order to prove that the function Ξ (ζ, |S|, |P (|S idle |)|) |P(|S idle |)|\nis concave in |P (|S idle |)| ∈ L j . Let F ˘ be the common distribution of ËÆÊ 1 i , where i is the random variable deﬁned in the proof of Theorem 1. Then, we have\nln (1 + z) dF |P(|S idle |)| ˘ \t (z) , (21) where the last equality follows from the fact that ln (1 + z) is integrable with respect to probability measures on [0, ∞).\nLet h (t, ξ) \t t 0 ln (1 + z) dF ξ ˘ (z) , ξ > 0. Then, it is sufﬁcient to show that h (t, ξ) is a monotonically increasing and concave function in ξ for all t > 0. Using integration by parts, we get\n1 + z dz. (22) By deﬁnition, it is obvious that h (t, ξ) is a monotonically increasing function in ξ. Hence, we have ∂h (t, ξ) /∂ξ ≥ 0 and only need to show that ∂ 2 h (t, ξ) /∂ξ 2 ≤ 0. For 0 < ξ 1 ≤ ξ 2 , we have\n1 + z \t dz = F ξ 2 −ξ 1 ˘ (t) ∂h (t, ξ) ∂ξ\n, \t (23) where (a) follows from the fact that F ˘ (z) is a monotonically increasing function being in the range [0, 1] and (b) follows by virtue of the fact that ∂h (t, ξ) /∂ξ ≥ 0. Therefore, ∂h (t, ξ) /∂ξ is a monotonically decreasing function in ξ and hence, we arrive at the fact that ∂ 2 h (t, ξ) /∂ξ 2 ≤ 0, from which we complete the proof."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S.
