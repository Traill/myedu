There are different ways to manage the interference including avoiding it through time or frequency multiplexing, treating other transmitters\u2019 interference as noise, or decoding the interference. Finding the optimal way to manage the interference has been a focus of research for the past few decades. Even for the simplest case of the two-user Gaussian interference channel (IC), the optimal interference manage- ment method is still out of reach. Speciﬁcally, the capacity region of the two-user IC is only known when the interference is strong [1]. For all other cases, the best achievable result is due to Han and Kobayashi [2]. By using a simple Han- Kobayashi scheme, Etkin et al. [3] characterized the capacity region of IC to within 1 bit/s/Hz.\nTo make progress, Avestimehr et al. [4] introduced a deter- ministic channel model to simplify the analysis of interference in multi-user wireless networks. This approximate model is simple to analyse, and at the same time is powerful enough to predict the behaviour of many multi-user channels includ- ing multiple access channel (MAC), broadcast channel, relay channel and so on. As an example, Bresler and Tse [5] showed that this model can provide the capacity region of the two-user Gaussian IC to within constant bits.\nIn a wireless network, it is usually assumed that transmitters always have data to send. However, in a more realistic model, one needs to consider the randomness of message arrivals at transmitters. The ﬂexibility of ALOHA [6] makes it the ﬁrst option used in wireless networks with random message arrivals. In ALOHA systems, if a collision occurs, receiver totally discards the sent packets.\nTo avoid the total loss of packets in case of collision in the slotted ALOHA system, Medard et al. in [7] considered a random access channel and developed a layered coding scheme. Their coding scheme is opportunistic in the sense that as the number of active users decreases, the number of layers which can be decoded at the receiver increases.\nRecently, Minero, Franceschetti and Tse [8] also studied the random access MAC from an information-theoretic per- spective. They assumed that each user in the MAC is active with probability p which is assumed to be known at all transmitters. Using a multilayer coding scheme, they showed that to obtain the throughput of the system, each user should opportunistically adjust its transmission strategy based on the value of p. In speciﬁc, in order to obtain the throughput of the system, each transmitter only requires to employ two different transmission strategies corresponding to the cases of p ≤ 1/2 and p > 1/2.\nIn this paper, a two-user interference channel with random access is investigated. As the ﬁrst step, a symmetric binary deterministic interference channel with crossover parameter α in which each transmitter is active with probability p is considered. Using the machinery developed in [8], it is shown that in order to achieve the throughput of the channel, each transmitter needs to change its transmission strategy based on the pair (p, α). Speciﬁcally, the decision region of each transmitter, D = {0 ≤ p ≤ 1, α > 0}, is divided into six sub- regions, and for each sub-region, a transmission strategy that maximizes the expected sum-rate of the system is proposed.\nThis paper is organized as follows: section II deﬁnes the system model and notations used throughout the paper. Section III presents two theorems which are the main results of this paper. The ﬁrst theorem characterizes the capacity region of the system, and the second theorem determines the channel throughput for all values of channel parameters. The converse part of the ﬁrst theorem is proved in section IV, and section V is the proof of the achievability part. Finally, conclusions and direction for further research are presented in section VI.\nThroughout this paper, all vectors are assumed to be column vectors, X[a : b] is a vector which includes elements of vector X from a th to b th position, and X[a : b, c : d] is a concatenation of X[a : b] and X[c : d].\nA two-user Gaussian IC is described by the following input- output relations\nwhere x 1 and x 2 are respectively the transmitted signals by transmitter one (Tx 1 ) and transmitter two (Tx 2 ), y 1 and y 2 are respectively the received signals at receiver one (Rx 1 ) and receiver two (Rx 2 ), and z i ∼ CN (0, 1) is the noise at Rx i . Avestimehr et al. introduced the binary deterministic interfer- ence channel [4] which is the ﬁrst order approximation of the interference channel. In the binary deterministic channel, the received signals can be represented by\n˜ y 2 = 2 n 21 ˜ x 1 ⊕ 2 n 22 ˜ x 2 , \t (2) where ⊕ is the module two addition, · is the integer part function, n 11 = log SNR 1 , n 12 = log INR 1 , n 22 =\nlog SNR 2 , and n 21 = log INR 2 . In this model, n 11 and n 22 represent the cut-off noise values; n 12 and n 21 represent the path loss of one transmitter relative to the other transmitter. Furthermore, by assuming the unity power constraints at both transmitters, the Tx i transmitted signal can be represented as a binary stream, i.e., ˜ x i = 0.b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 . . . , i = 1, 2. In the symmetric binary deterministic interference channel, n 1,1 = n 2,2 = n, and n 1,2 = n 2,1 = nα.\nIn a two-user random access interference channel (RAIC), it is assumed that both transmitters have two states which are called active and inactive. In each transmission, the active transmitter sends a codeword to its intended receiver while the inactive transmitter remains silent. The receivers know the state of both transmitters while each transmitter only knows its own state, and the state of transmitters does not change during each transmission. The transmitters\u2019 states in each time slot are independent from each other. Furthermore, the states of each transmitter during different time slots are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). When both transmitters are active, each transmitter communicates with its corresponding receiver through an interference channel, and when only one transmitter is active, the active transmitter is connected to its intended receiver via a point-to-point channel. Let W i be the set of all messages sent by Tx i ,\nwhere W i,j are independent messages and uniformly dis- tributed over a set with cardinality 2 nR i,j , i ∈ {1, 2} and j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , |W i |}. Also, let W i {A} ⊆ W i denote the set of those messages of Tx i which can be reliably decoded at Rx i when set A ⊆ {1, 2} of transmitters are active, and r i (A) denote the sum-rate of the messages in W i (A). Note that transmitters are not aware of each other\u2019s state and consequently the set A. Hence, each transmitter uses the same\nmessage set in all time slots as long as the transmission probabilities and the channel parameter α are ﬁxed. Assuming each transmitter is active with probability p, the maximum expected sum-rate, or throughput, of the RAIC is deﬁned as\nwhere the maximization is over all the rate quadruples r 1 ({1}), r 1 ({1, 2}), r 2 ({2}), r 2 ({1, 2}) .\nTo ﬁnd the channel throughput, the region of rate quadruples r 1 ({1}), r 1 ({1, 2}), r 2 ({2}), r 2 ({1, 2}) needs to be char-\nacterized. To characterize this region, we require to model different channel states. To this aim, a network with two interfering broadcast channels is used. This network depicted in Fig. 1 has two transmitters and four receivers, and models all states of the channel. In this network, Rx P2P i , i ∈ {1, 2}, are used to model the channel state in which only the transmitter i is active, and Rx 1 , Rx 2 are used to model the channel state in which both transmitters are active.\nAs the ﬁrst step to analyse RAIC, the binary deterministic channel is used to model the point-to-point channels as well as the interference channel. The resulted network is called binary deterministic - random access interference channel (BD-RAIC). It is clear that if a message can be decoded by Rx i , it can also be decoded at Rx P2P i . So, without loss of generality, it is assumed that\nA rate quadruple r 1 ({1}), r 1 ({1, 2}), r 2 ({2}), r 2 ({1, 2}) is said to be achievable for the message structure W if there exists\na sequence of encoding and decoding functions such that as the block length goes to inﬁnity, Rx P2P i , i ∈ {1, 2} can decode the messages in the set W i {i}, and Rx i , i ∈ {1, 2} can decode the messages in the set W i {1, 2} with vanishing probability of error. Let C W be the set of all achievable rate quadruples for the message structure W. Note that depending on the values of |W 1 | and |W 2 |, we have many possible message structures for a given channel. For each message structure, we can deﬁne C W . The capacity region of the channel in Fig. 1 is deﬁned as the closure of the union of all C W over all possible message structures W, i.e.,\nThe main results of this paper are summarized in the following theorems.\nTheorem 1. The capacity region C of the symmetric BD-RAIC is given by\nR IC 1 + R RA 1 ≤ n, \t (8) R IC 2 + R RA 2 ≤ n, \t (9) R IC 1 + R IC 2 ≤ 2 max{nα, n(1 − α) + }, \t (10)\nR RA 1 + R IC 1 + R IC 2 ≤ n(1 − α) + + max{nα, n}, (11) R IC 1 + R IC 2 + R RA 2 ≤ n(1 − α) + + max{nα, n}, (12)\n+ max{nα, n(1 − α) + }, (13) R IC 1 + 2R IC 2 + R RA 2 ≤ n(1 − α) + + max{nα, n},\nThe proof of converse is presented in section IV. For the achievability part, we show in section V that all the corner points of C are achievable, and therefore the entire region is achievable by time sharing between these corner points.\nTheorem 2. The throughput of the symmetric BD-RAIC de- ﬁned in (4) is given by\n           \n          \n1 − αp \t if 1 2 ≤ α < 1, p ≤ 1 2 p(3α − 2) + 2(1 − α) if 1 2 ≤ α < 2 3 , p > 1 2\n1 − α 2 \t if 2 3 ≤ α < 1, p > 1 2 p(α − 2) + 1 \t if 1 ≤ α < 2, p ≤ 1 2\nif 1 ≤ α < 2, p > 1 2 1 \t if α ≥ 2\nProof: To ﬁnd the channel throughput, it is re- quired to maximize (4) over all the rate quadruples\n(R IC 1 , R RA 1 , R IC 2 , R RA 2 ) in the region determined by Theo- rem 1. Since this region is convex, for a ﬁxed transmission probability p, the maximum expected sum-rate happens in one of the corner points. The corner points can be found by using linear programming methods, and in order to ﬁnd the maximum expected sum-rate, it is sufﬁcient to compute and compare the expected sum-rate in corner points. This ends in (17). In Fig. 2, the corner points achieving the throughput in different regions of (p, α) are presented.\nIn Theorem 2, the system throughput is compared by 2np which is the throughput of the system including two independent channels in which transmitters are active with probability p, and capacity of each channel is n bits. In Fig. 3, TP 2np is depicted in terms of α for different p and different transmission strategies. In ALOHA strategy, each transmitter ignores the presence of other transmitter, so the Throughput is 2np(1 − p). In IC strategy, each transmitter assumes that the other transmitter is always active, so TP p is equal to the sum-capacity of the binary deterministic interference channel.\nIn this part, we explain some implications of Theorem 2. Recall that the only parameters that a transmitter can base its transmission strategy on, are (p, α). According to Theorem 2, in order to achieve the channel throughput each transmitter needs to divide its decision region in (p, α) plane into six sub-regions as depicted in Fig. 2. In each sub-region of Fig. 2, the rate quadruple (R IC 1 , R RA 1 , R IC 2 , R RA 2 ) which achieves the channel throughput in that sub-region is provided. The following observations can be made from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3:\n\u2022 In the very strong interference regime (α > 2), there is no possibility for opportunistic transmission regardless of p. This is predictable because the very strong interference is equivalent to no interference [1].\n\u2022 When 2/3 < α < 2 and p > 1/2, a conservative strategy, IC strategy, in which each transmitter adjusts its transmission strategy based on the activeness of both users yields the channel throughput.\n\u2022 For all the remaining cases, the opportunistic transmission provides a throughput gain compare to the other strategies.\n\u2022 The ALOHA strategy in which each transmitter ignores the existence of the other transmitter is always suboptimal in the sense of channel throughput.\nIn a symmetric BD-RAIC depicted in Fig. 1, it is assumed that the channel inputs, X 1 and X 2 and the channel outputs, Y 1 ,Y 2 ,Y IC 1 and Y IC 2 , can be represented as binary vectors with length of max{n, nα}. For example, X 1 can be written as\nwhere x 1,1 and x 1,max{n,nα} are the most and the least signif- icant bits respectively. The input signals are always placed in the ﬁrst n least signiﬁcant bits of X 1 and X 2 . In other words, when the lengths of X 1 and X 2 are equal to nα, their ﬁrst n(α − 1) bits are zero. In the i th time unit, i ∈ {1, 2, 3, .., N }, the channel can be described by the following input-output relations\nand nα is an integer number, S u and S d are one bit upper and lower shift matrices respectively. S u and S d can be written as\nwhere I l is an identity matrix with size l × l , S 0 u \t I and S 0 d I. For a BD-RAIC, we claim that the rates are upper\nr 1 ({1, 2}) ≤ r 1 ({1}) ≤ n \t (22) r 2 ({1, 2}) ≤ r 2 ({2}) ≤ n \t (23)\nr 1 ({1, 2}) + r 2 ({1, 2}) ≤ H(Y IC 1 |V 1 ) + H(Y IC 2 |V 2 ) (24) r 1 ({1}) + r 2 ({1, 2}) ≤ H(Y 1 |V 1 ) + H(Y IC 2 ) \t (25) r 1 ({1, 2}) + r 2 ({2}) ≤ H(Y IC 1 ) + H(Y 2 |V 2 ) \t (26)\n(22) and (23) are direct results of the channel model and (5). (24) is one of the upper bounds for the rates in the deterministic interference channel which have been previously proved in [5] and [9]. To prove other bounds, we deﬁne X i ,Y i ,Y IC i and V i as follows\nX i = {X i,1 , . . . , X i,N }, Y i = {Y i,1 , . . . , Y i,N }, (29) Y IC i = {Y IC i,1 , . . . , Y IC i,N }, V i = {V i,1 , . . . , V i,N }. (30)\n= I(W 1 ({1}); Y 1 |W 1 \\W 1 ({1})) + H(W 1 ({1})|Y 1 , W 1 \\W 1 ({1})) + I(W 2 ({1, 2}); Y IC 2 |W 2 \\W 2 ({1, 2}))\n+ I(W 2 ({1, 2}); Y IC 2 |W 2 \\W 2 ({1, 2})) + 2N N = I(W 1 ({1}); Y 1 V 1 |W 1 \\W 1 ({1}))\n+ I(W 2 ({1, 2}); Y IC 2 |W 2 \\W 2 ({1, 2})) + 2N N = I(W 1 ({1}); V 1 |W 1 \\W 1 ({1}))\nwhere (a) comes from Fano\u2019s inequality, H(W i ({i})|Y i ) ≤ N N , H(W i ({1, 2})|Y IC i ) ≤ N N , in which N tends to zero as N goes to inﬁnity, and (b) comes from H(Y IC 2 |X 2 ) = H(V 1 ). Dividing both side by N and taking the limit as N → ∞, (25) is followed. To prove (27), we assume that a genie provides Rx 2 with V 2 , and the rest of the proof is similar to what we have done to prove (25). To prove (28), genie provides Rx 1 with V 1 , and the proof is followed in the same way. For\nthe complete proof of the outer bound please refer to [10] which is the extended version of this paper. Using (15) and (16), one can readily check that the outer bound inequalities in (22) to (28) are simpliﬁed to the inequalities stated in Theorem 1.\nTo achieve the region in Theorem 1, it sufﬁces to superim- pose a codeword carrying R RA i on top of Han and Kobayashi\u2019s coding scheme [2]. So, the message structure is deﬁned as follows\nW i = W i ({i}) = {W RA i , W IC i,c , W IC i,p }, \t (31) W i ({1, 2}) = {W IC i,c , W IC i,p }. \t (32)\nRx P2P i can decode all the messages sent by Tx i . Rx 1 decodes W IC 1,c , W IC 1,p , and also decodes W IC 2,c which is sent by the other transmitter. Rx 2 decodes W IC 2,c ,W IC 2,p , and W IC 1,c . If W RA i , W IC i,c and W IC i,p are encoded at rates R RA i ,R IC i,c and R IC i,p respectively, we have\nr i ({i}) = R RA i + R IC i,c + R IC i,p , \t (33) r i ({1, 2}) = R IC i = R IC i,c + R IC i,p . \t (34)\nThe proof of achievability of (R IC 1 , R RA 1 , R IC 2 , R RA 2 ) is equivalent to the proof of achievability of\nr 1 ({1}), r 1 ({1, 2}), r 2 ({2}), r 2 ({1, 2}) , because they are linearly related. To show that the region stated in Theorem 1 is achievable, we need to show that its corner points are achievable. The number of corner points of the region C depends on α. A corner point T 1 is said to be dominated by a corner point T 2 , if each coordinate of T 1 is less than or equal to the corresponding coordinate of T 2 . The achievability proof is consequently reduced to the achievability of dominant corner points. Due to the space limitation, we prove the achievability of a dominant corner point for 0 < α < 2 in the following. For the complete achievability scheme please refer to the full version of this paper [10].\nTo achieve (n(1−α), nα, n(1−α), nα), each transmitter sends W IC i,p in X i [1 : n(α − 1)] and W RA i in X i [n(1 − α) + 1 : n]. \u2022 1/2 ≤ α < 2/3\nTo achieve (nα, n(2 − 3α), nα, n(2 − 3α)), each transmitter uses the following encoding scheme\nX i [1 : n(2α − 1)] \t =e i (W IC i,c ), X i [n(2α − 1) + 1 : n(1 − α), 2n(1 − α) + 1 : n]=e i (W IC i,p ), X i [nα + 1 : 2n(1 − α)] \t =e i (W RA i ),\nwhere e i (·) is the encoding function of Tx i , and all the remaining bits of X i are set to zero. \u2022 2/3 ≤ α < 1\nTo achieve (2n(1 − α), 0, nα, 0), Tx 2 uses the following encoding scheme\n4 : X 1 n(3α − 2) + 1 : n(2α − 1) = X 1 1 : n(1 − α) , while all the remaining bits of X 1 and X 2 are set to zero. \u2022 1 ≤ α < 2\nTo achieve (n(α − 1), 0, n, 0), Tx 2 sends W IC 2,c in bits from n(α − 1) + 1 to nα. Tx 1 uses the following encoding scheme\nα ≥ 3 2\nThis simple repetition code makes Rx 2 be able to completely decode the interference.\nWe used a binary deterministic model to analyse the ran- dom access interference channel. For the symmetric case, we proved that a coding scheme which splits the rate among three messages can achieve the throughput of the channel. In this coding scheme, two messages are always decoded while the third one is opportunistically decoded when only one transmitter is active. Extending this work to the Gaussian channel model is the focus of another research paper."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A.
