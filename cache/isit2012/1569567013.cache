In this paper, we show that the approximate optimality continues to hold even for wireless networks modeled as directed graphs as long as there is a sym- metric demand constraint: every demand from source s i to sink t i at rate R i has a counterpart demand from source node t i to sink node s i at the same rate. This models several practical scenarios including voice calls, video calls, and interactive gaming. We prove this result in the context of several channel models for which good local schemes exist.

Recent work [6], [7], [8] has made progress in this direction by giving an approximate characterization of this capacity region by using the reciprocity in wireless channels. It has been shown that simple layered architectures involving local physical-layer schemes combined with global routing can achieve approx- imately optimal performance in wireless networks.\nIn many practical scenarios, the reciprocity may be affected due to asymmetric power constraints, directional antennas or frequency-duplexing. The question we address in this paper is: \u201cdo layered architectures continue to be optimal even in this case?\u201d We answer this question in the afﬁrmative under a special trafﬁc model called the symmetric demands model: there are k specially-marked source-sink pairs of nodes (s i , t i ), i = 1, 2, ..., k with s i wanting to communicate an independent message to t i at rate R i and t i wanting to communicate an independent message to s i at rate R i . This trafﬁc model is valid in several practical scenarios including voice calls, video calls, and interactive gaming.\nThe symmetric demands trafﬁc model was originally studied for wireline networks by Klein, Plotkin, Rao and Tardos [1], who established that the routing rate region and edge- cuts are within a factor O(log 2 k) of each other. This result, however, does not establish that routing is approximately optimal since edge-cuts do not, in general, bound the rate of general communication schemes. A companion paper [2] does\nso by proving that edge-cuts in fact, form fundamental outer bounds for the communication rates under this trafﬁc model.\nIn this paper, we show an analogous result for wireless net- works under several channel models for which good schemes are known at a local level. Our results for wireless networks with symmetric demands include\n1) Capacity approximations for networks comprised of Gaussian MAC and broadcast channels,\n2) Degrees-of-freedom approximation for ﬁxed Gaussian networks, and\n3) Capacity approximations for fading Gaussian networks. At the heart of our achievable scheme is a connection to\n\u201cpolymatroidal networks\u201d for which the symmetric demands problem was recently addressed [4]. Our outer bound is based on the Generalized Network Sharing bound [5], which we extend to wireless networks in this work.\nSingle hop wireless networks (called interference and X- networks) have been studied extensively in recent times, starting with the seminal work of [12], which proposed an interference alignment scheme (building on [13]) by which each user in a fast fading interference channel can achieve half the degrees-of-freedom simultaneously. This result has been extended to a variety of other scenarios, including interference channel with ﬁxed channel coefﬁcients [15], [16], approximate capacity characterization of ergodic interference channels [14]. In this paper, we build on these results to obtain results for a network comprised of such channels.\nWireless networks with multiple hops have also been stud- ied under several trafﬁc models, starting from the capacity approximation for unicast and multicast trafﬁc in [17], the multiple-source single-sink case in [18] and broadcast trafﬁc in [19].\nMultiple-unicast in general wireless networks has started receiving attention only recently. Certain classes of 2-unicast problems were studied in [21], 2-unicast deterministic net- works were studied in [26], and the degrees-of-freedom of 2-unicast was established in [20]. K-unicasts in certain topolo- gies were studied in [22] where K sources communicate to K sinks via L fully-connected layers of K relays each. Compute and forward schemes for layered networks were presented in [23]. Multiple multicasts in networks of 2-user Gaussian MAC and broadcast channels was studied in [24], where a separation scheme was shown to be approximately optimal. While these\nexisting works attempt to compute the degrees-of-freedom (or approximate capacity) exactly for speciﬁc instances of the problem, we adopt a different viewpoint and focus our attention on obtaining general results for arbitrary networks at the expense of obtaining potentially weaker approximation in speciﬁc instances.\nIn this section, we provide the basic background on which the main results are then built.\nWe review the directed wireline network problem with sym- metric demands. There is a directed wireline graph G = (V, E) with capacity functions c(e) ∀e ∈ E and k source-sink pairs (s i , t i ), i = 1, 2, ..., k. For the symmetric demands problem, a rate tuple (R 1 , ..., R k ) is said to be achievable if s i can communicate to t i at rate R i and t i can communicate at s i at rate R i . A fundamental question in this context is \u201cHow good is routing?\u201d.\nThe optimal performance achievable by routing can be written as a linear program, whose solution can be computed in time that grows only polynomial with the size of the graph (see [1]). Let R f denote the set of all k-tuples achievable by routing. An obvious bound on the rate of ﬂow is the edge-cut bound, deﬁned as follows. Given a subset of edges (called an edge-cut) F ⊆ E, let c(F ) := e∈F c(e) denotes the capacity of the cut. Let K(F ) denote the set of i ∈ {1, 2, ..., k} such that either there is no path from s i to t i or there is no path between t i to s i in E \\ F . Now, the edge-cut bound is given by i∈K(F ) R i ≤ c(F ). The set of rate tuples that satisfy all the edge-cut bounds is called the edge-cut bound region R e.c. . Note that if for some index i ∈ K(F ), there is no path from s i to t i and no path from t i to s i in E \\ F, then we could have a tighter inequality with the co-efﬁcient of R i being 2 instead of 1. These tighter inequalities are not always fundamental (i.e., they do not upper bound general network coding rates of communication, only those achievable via routing), but in any case, they result in tighter bounds by at most a factor of two. A classical result [1] shows that\ni.e., the rate region achievable by ﬂow is within an O(log 2 k) factor of the edge-cut bound.\nWhile the edge-cut bound is an upper bound on the ﬂow, it is not clear if the edge-cut bound is an upper bound on the rates achievable by arbitrary coding schemes. In fact, it is known [25] that edge-cuts do not bound the capacity region for general directed graphs (for general directed graphs, the edge-cut is any subset of edges that disconnects s i from t i , for all i ∈ K for some subset K).\nIn a recent companion work [2], we show that edge cut bounds give fundamental upper bounds on the capacity region\nfor the directed graphs with symmetric demands problem. This result along with (1) establishes that routing is within a factor O(log 2 k) optimal. The basic engine in the proof is the bound established in [5] called the Generalized Network Sharing (GNS) bound. The GNS bound establishes that certain edge cuts which disconnect s i from t j , whenever i ≥ j are fundamental. The basic idea in the proof of [2] is a combinatorial argument showing that, in the directed graph with symmetric demands problem, there is a re-labeling of s i and t i (by swapping and permutation) such that any given edge cut can be seen to be a so-called GNS-cut.\nA standard wireline network model is an edge-capacitated graph; each edge is associated with a capacity that constrains the total amount of information that can be communicated on it. Polymatroidal networks are a strictly more general model and handle additional constraints when edges meet at a node, similar in spirit to the broadcast and interference constraints in wireless. In particular, we study a directed graph G = (V, E) where the constraints on the information ﬂow f e on edge e are given by\nwhere ρ in v (·) and ρ out v (·) are polymatroidal functions on the corresponding input sets.\nWhile prior work establishes a max-ﬂow min-cut result for unicast communication [9], [10] and broadcast trafﬁc [11], recent work has established approximate max-ﬂow min-cut results for the case of both bi-directed polymatroidal networks and for polymatroidal networks with symmetric demands.\nWe recall the following theorem from [4], which general- izes the results of [1] to the case of polymatroidal capacity networks:\nTheorem 1. [4] For a directed polymatroidal network with k source-destination pairs having symmetric demands,\nThe communication network is represented by a directed graph G = (V, E), and an edge coloring ψ : E → C, where C is the set of colors. Each node v has a set of colors C(v) ⊆ C on which it operates. Each color can be thought of as an orthogonal resource, and therefore the broadcast and interference constraints for the wireless channel apply only within a given color. The channel model can therefore be written as,\nwhere x c i , y c i , z c i are the transmitted vector, received vector and noise vector on color c, h c ji is the channel coefﬁcient between node i and node j on color c and In c (i) represents the set of in-neighbors of node i who are operating on color c and d c (i) = |N c (i)| be the degree of node i in color c. Let d = max c,v d c (v) be the maximum degree of any node in a given color; therefore, d is the maximum number of users on any component broadcast or multiple access channel.\nA network is composed of broadcast and multiple access channels if and only if no edge is involved simultaneously in a broadcast and interference constraint inside the same color. We will call such a network a \u201cGaussian MAC+BC network\u201d. We will assume that each color represents a distinct MAC or broadcast channel without loss of generality. Each node has a power constraint P to transmit on each edge. If there are distinct power constraints for different nodes, they can be absorbed into the channel co-efﬁcient without loss of generality.\n1) Edge-cut bound: The edge cut bound for the gaussian MAC+BC network is deﬁned by the following: consider any set F ⊆ E, as in the wireline case, let K(F ) denote the set of i ∈ {1, 2, ..., k} such that either there is no path from s i to t i or there is no path between t i to s i in E \\ F . The capacity of the cut c(F ) is deﬁned, in the obvious way, as the sum of three terms: the capacities of the orthogonal links in F , the sum- capacity of sub-MAC components of F and the sum-capacity of sub-BC components of F , where sum-capacity of sub- MAC (sub-BC) component is computed assuming complete coordination among source (destination) terminals of the sub- MAC (sub-BC) component. The edge-cut bound region is now given as\nAs in the wireline network case, it is not immediately obvious if R e.c. is an outer bound to the capacity region.\nThere are k pairs of nodes s i , t i , i = 1, 2, ..., k, where node s i has a message to send to t i and t i has a message to send to s i at rate R i . We would like to characterize the set of all achievable rate tuples, called the capacity region C. We will use R ach to denote rates achievable by our proposed simple scheme, R e.c. to denote the edge-cut region and C to denote the capacity region. Our main result is the following.\nTheorem 2. For the k-unicast problem with symmetric de- mands in a Gaussian MAC+BC network, the edge-cut bound is fundamental and a simple separation strategy can achieve R ach (P ) which satisﬁes,\nO(log 2 k) ⊆ R ach (P ) ⊆ C(P ) ⊆ R e.c. (P ). \t (7) Thus, the edge-cut bound is a fundamental upper bound on\nthe capacity region and furthermore the edge-cut bound, scaled down in power by a factor d and in rate by a factor \t 1 O(log 2 k) , can be achieved by the proposed scheme.\nWe ﬁrst establish that the edge-cut bound is fundamental, i.e., every communication scheme must have rate pairs that lie inside this region: C ⊆ R e.c. . A GNS-cut is an edge-cut with stronger disconnection properties. More precisely, the edge-cut that disconnects s i from t i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k is a GNS-cut if there exists a permutation π : {1, 2, . . . , k} → {1, 2, . . . , k} such that the edge-cut disconnects s i from t j whenever π(i) ≥ π(j). The key argument is a bound based on GNS cuts for Gaussian MAC+BC networks:\nLemma 1. For the Gaussian MAC+BC network with sym- metric demands, every GNS cut F is fundamental, i.e.,\nR i ≤ c(F ) for any communication scheme achieving (R 1 , ..., R k ).\nProof: Without loss of generality, let F be a GNS-cut disconnecting s i from t i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k with say, the identity permutation π id . Thus, K(F ) = {1, 2, . . . , k}. We ﬁrst provide a proof of the bound for networks with acyclic underlying graph G.\nLet C = M ∪ B where M consists of the colors of edges involved in MAC components and B consists of colors of edges involved in broadcast components or orthogonal links. For µ ∈ C, let A µ denote the set of edges involved in µ. Now, consider a directed graph G with nodes represented by A µ , µ ∈ C as follows: there exists a directed edge from A µ to A ν in G if and only if there exists an edge in A µ that is upstream to some edge in A ν in the given DAG G. Since the set of all edges with a given color constitute either a MAC or a BC or form a single orthogonal link, we have that G is a directed acyclic graph. Thus, we can have a total order on the vertices of G consistent with the partial order of ancestry in G . This gives a total order on D := {µ ∈ C : F ∩ A µ = ∅}, which may be presumed to be, say µ 1 < µ 2 < . . . < µ r , where µ 1 is the most \u201cupstream\u201d.\n\u2022 For µ ∈ M, we denote transmissions along edge e in A µ by X e and we denote the reception by Y µ so that\nX e + Z µ where Z µ is Gaussian noise. Further, deﬁne U µ := {X e : e ∈ F ∩ A µ }, and\n\u2022 For µ ∈ B, we denote the transmission on the broadcast component or orthogonal link by X µ and the receptions at heads of e ∈ A µ by Y e so that Y e = X µ + Z e where {Z e , e ∈ A µ } are independent Gaussian noise random variables. Further deﬁne U µ := X µ , and V µ := {Y e : e ∈ F ∩ A µ }.\nDeﬁne ˜ Y t i = {Y n µ : head(e) = t i , e ∈ A µ , µ ∈ M} ∪ {Y n e : head(e) = t i , e ∈ A µ , µ ∈ B}.\n[since W i is independent of {W j : j < i}] = I({W i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k}; {V n µ : µ ∈ D}) = h({V n µ : µ ∈ D})\n− h({V n µ : µ ∈ D}|{W i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k}) ≤\n≥ h(V n µ 1 , V n µ 2 , . . . , V n µ r |{W i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, U n µ 1 ) = h(V n µ\n+ h(V n µ 2 , . . . , V n µ r |{W i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, U n µ 1 , V n µ 1 ) = h(V n µ 1 |U n µ 1 )\n+ h(V n µ 2 , . . . , V n µ r |{W i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, U n µ 1 , V n µ 1 ) [since {W i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} − U n µ 1 − V n µ 1 ]\n= h(V n µ 1 |U n µ 1 ) + h(V n µ 2 |{W i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, U n µ 1 , V n µ 1 , U n µ 2 ) + h(V n µ\n|{W i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, U n µ 1 , V n µ 1 , U n µ 2 , V n µ 2 ) = h(V n µ\n+ h(V n µ 3 , . . . , V n µ r |{W i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, U n µ 1 , V n µ 1 , U n µ 2 , V n µ 2 ) [since {W i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, U n µ 1 , V n µ 1 − U n µ 2 − V n µ 2 ]\nThe proof can be extended to networks with cyclic underlying graphs by employing a standard time-layering argument (see [17]).\nThe result from the companion paper [2], states that for the directed graph with symmetric demands problem: any edge- cut is basically a GNS-cut. Using this result in conjunction with Lemma 1, gives us the desired result: C(P ) ⊆ R e.c. (P ). C. Coding Scheme\nThe coding scheme is a separation-based strategy: each component broadcast or multiple access channel is coded for independently creating bit-pipes on which information is routed globally. In order to evaluate the rate region of this scheme, we use polymatroidal networks as an interface for which we can show that routing and edge-cut are close to each other.\nLet us ﬁrst consider the coding for the multiple access chan- nel with channel coefﬁcients h 1 , ..., h d and power constraint P at each of the d nodes. Let the rate region achievable on this multiple access channel be denoted by\nThis region is known to be polymatroidal. The outer bound for MAC under arbitrary source cooperation is given by\nSimilarly for a broadcast channel with channel h 1 , ..., h k with power constraint P the achievable region includes the polymatroidal region\nObserve that R MAC cut (P ) ⊆ R MAC ach (dP ) and R BC cut (P ) ⊆ R BC ach (dP ). Now, each multiple access or broadcast channel can be replaced by a set of d bit-pipes whose rates are jointly constrained by the corresponding polymatroidal constraints. Thus the network induced by using this coding scheme falls under the category of directed polymatroidal networks with symmetric demands. We now invoke Theorem 1 to show that the routing rate region and the edge-cut bounds in the polymatroidal network are within a factor of log 2 k of each other, i.e.,\nFinally, we relate the polymatroidal cuts back to the cuts in the Gaussian network using the relation between MAC (BC) channel achievable regions and the corresponding cuts.\nIn this section, we consider general Gaussian networks, i.e., networks where broadcast and MAC can occur simultaneously. Our network-level results are under the following two settings: 1) Degrees-of-freedom in ﬁxed Gaussian channels 2) Capacity approximation in ergodic Gaussian channels. Due to lack of space, we only state the main results, referring the reader to [3] for detailed proofs.\nWe consider a communication network with the edges of the network having fading coefﬁcients on them, each chosen independently from a continuous fading distribution. Our main result is the following:\nTheorem 3. For a directed wireless network with symmetric demands, if the ﬁxed channel coefﬁcients are drawn from a continuous distribution, the DOF region given by D ach satisfying\nIn an ergodic wireless network, the channel model is similar to the ﬁxed Gaussian network, except that we assume that all the non-zero fading coefﬁcients are varying as a function of time in an i.i.d. manner according to a fading distribution which is assumed to be symmetric and to satisfy a weak tail assumption: a := e −E(log |h| 2 ) < ∞. One example of such a fading distribution is the i.i.d. complex gaussian distribution, for which a ≈ 1.78 [27]. The main result is stated below.\nTheorem 4.
