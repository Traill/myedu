All UTs and ATs have a single antenna each. The ATs are con- nected with a central processor (CP) via wired links of ﬁxed rate R 0 . We study the downlink scenario, where the CP wishes to deliver independent messages to the UTs. This is a simple instance of a broadcast relay network, where the ATs operate as relays. In this work we focus on the sum-rate and assume that the CP and all UTs have perfect channel state information (more general results are provided in [1]). If R 0 → ∞, the problem reduces to the well-known vector Gaussian broadcast channel, the capacity region of which is achieved by Dirty Paper Coding (DPC). However, for ﬁxed ﬁnite R 0 , DPC and other widely considered linear precoding schemes cannot be applied in a straightforward manner. A simple DAS system, the so-called Soft-Handoff model, was investigated in [2], by introducing a \u201ccompressed\u201d version of DPC (CDPC), where the CP performs joint DPC under per-antenna power constraint and then sends the compressed (or quantized) codewords to the corresponding ATs via the wired links. While this scheme is expected to be near-optimal for very large R 0 , it is generally suboptimal at ﬁnite (possibly small) R 0 . Also, DPC\nis notoriously difﬁcult to be implemented in practice, due to the nested lattice coding construction and lattice quantization steps involved (See for example [3], [4]).\nMotivated by Compute-and-Forward (CoF) [5] (or quantized compute-and-forward (QCoF) [6]), we propose a novel coding strategy named Reverse QCoF (RQCoF) for the DAS downlink with ﬁnite backhaul link capacity R 0 . In QCoF and RQCoF the coding block length n can be arbitrarily large but the shaping block length is restricted to 1 (scalar quantization [6]). However, we would like to point out that the same approach can be straightforwardly applied to CoF based schemes, where also the shaping dimension becomes large (in this case, we would refer to the scheme as Reverse CoF (RCoF)).\nLet Z p = Z mod p Z denote the ﬁnite ﬁeld of size p, with p a prime number, ⊕ denote addition over Z p , and g : Z p → R be the natural mapping of the elements of Z p onto {0, 1, ..., p− 1} ⊂ R . For a lattice Λ, let Q Λ (x) = argminλ ∈Λ { x − λ } denote the associated lattice quantizer, V = {x ∈ R n : Q Λ (x) = 0} the Voronoi region and deﬁne [x] mod Λ = x− Q Λ (x). For κ ∈ R , consider the two nested one-dimensional lattices Λ s = {x = κpz : z ∈ Z } and Λ c = {x = κz : z ∈ Z }, and deﬁne the constellation set S Λ c ∩ V s , where V s is the Voronoi region of Λ s , i.e., the interval [−κp/2, κp/2). The modulation mapping m : Z p → S is deﬁned by v = m(u) \t [κg(u)] mod Λ s . The inverse function m −1 (·) is referred to as the demodulation mapping, and it is given by u = m −1 (v) g −1 ([v/κ] mod p Z ) with v ∈ S.\nConsider the (real-valued) K-user Gaussian multiple access channel with inputs {x ,i : i = 1, ..., n} for = 1, ..., K, output {y i : i = 1, ..., n} and coefﬁcients h = (h 1 , ..., h K ) T ∈ R K , deﬁned by\nwhere the z i \u2019s are i.i.d. ∼ N (0, 1). All users encode their information messages {w ∈ Z k p : = 1, . . . , K} using the same linear code C over Z p (i.e., denoting information\nsequences and codewords by row vectors, we have c = w G where G is a generator matrix for C), and produce their channel inputs according to\nwhere c ,i is the i-th symbol of c and d ,i \u2019s are i.i.d. dithering symbols ∼ Uniform(V s ), known at the receiver. The channel inputs x ,i are uniformly distributed over V s and have second moment SNR E [|x ,i | 2 ] = κ 2 p 2 /12. The receiver\u2019s goal is to recover a linear combination c = q c of the transmitted users\u2019 codewords, for some coefﬁcients q ∈ Z p . For this purpose, the receiver selects the integer coefﬁcients vector a = (a 1 , ..., a K ) T ∈ Z K and produces the sequence of quantized observations\nfor i = 1, . . . , n. It is easy to show [6] that (3) is equivalent to\nwith q = g −1 ([a ] mod p Z ). Here, ˜ z i = m −1 ([Q Λ c (ε)] mod Λ s ) where ε denotes the effective noise, capturing a Gaussian additive noise and non-integer penalty, and its vari- ance [6] is\nThis is obtained by minimizing with respect to signal scaling α in (3). By [6, Th. 1], the achievable computation rate of QCoF is given by\nAlso, by [5, Th. 4], the achievable computation rate of CoF is given by\nWe showed in [6] that, for ﬁxed large SNR \t 1 and sufﬁciently large p (e.g., p ≥ 251), the (6) and (7) differ approximately by the shaping gain, i.e., ≈ 0.25 bits per real dimension.\nThe main idea is that each UT decodes a linear combination (over the ﬁnite ﬁeld) of the messages sent by the ATs using QCoF. In short, we exchange the role of the ATs and UTs and use QCoF in the reverse direction. However, decoding linear combination of the information messages is useful only when these combinations can be shared such that the individual messages can be recovered, provided that the resulting system of linear equations is invertible over Z p . Since the UTs do not cooperate, sharing the decoded linear combinations is impossible in the downlink. Nevertheless, thanks to algebraic structure of QCoF (or CoF), the messages from the ATs can be the precoded versions of the original information messages and hence, using an appropriate invertible precoding over Z p at the CP, the effect of the linear combination can be undone\nat the transmitter, so that every UT obtains just its own desired message. For simplicity of exposition, in this paper we restrict to the case K = L and consider the real-valued channel y = Hx + z deﬁned by the downlink (from ATs to UTs) channel matrix H ∈ R L×L . Let a T denote the set of integer coefﬁcients as in (3), obtained by the -th UT, deﬁne A to be the matrix with rows a T , and let Q = [A] mod p denote the downlink \u201dsystem matrix\u201d over Z p . For the time being we assume that Q is invertible over Z p , although they may be rank deﬁcient since each UT chooses its own linear combination coefﬁcients independently of the other nodes. The case of rank deﬁciency will be handled later. Let ˜ z be the discrete additive noise (over Z p ) at the -th UT. The detailed description of \u201creverse\u201d QCoF (RQCoF) is as follows.\n\u2022 For the given Q, the CP precodes the user information messages {w ∈ Z k p : = 1, ..., L} using the inverse system matrix Q −1 . The precoded L-dimensional vectors of information symbols to be transmitted by the ATs are given by\n\u2022 The CP forwards each block µ = (µ ,1 , ..., µ ,k ) to the -th AT, during n time slots, corresponding to the duration\nof a codeword sent on the wireless channel. Therefore, we have the rate constraint (k/n) log p ≤ R 0 .\n\u2022 After receiving k symbols, the -th AT locally encodes its information symbols µ using the same linear code C over Z p (i.e., c = µ G), and produces its channel input according to\n(8) \u2022 By [6, Th. 1], the -th UT can recover a noiseless linear\ncombination of ATs\u2019 information symbols if R ≤ log p − max {H(˜ z )}. This is given by\nq T (µ 1,i , ..., µ L,i ) T = q T Q −1 (w 1,i , ..., w L,i ) T = w ,i , for i = 1, . . . , k.\nHence, the -th UT can successfully recover its desired message.\nfor any full-rank matrix Q. Similarly, from (7), we can get an achievable sum-rate of RCoF\nRemark 1: The rates in (9) and (10) can be improved using the following particular code construction. Without loss of generality, assume that R 1 = k 1 /n ≥ R 2 = k 2 /n ≥ · · · ≥ R L = k L /n. Let {w : = 1, ..., L} be zero- padded messages to the common length k 1 . Each zero-padded message is encoded by the same generator matrix, forming the\ncodewords c = w G. Differently from the original RQCoF, the CP precodes the codewords as:\nSince (ν ,1 , ..., ν ,n ) ∈ C, the CP can forward the correspond- ing index (k log p bits per channel use) instead of codeword itself (n log p bits per channel use), which is a kind of com- pression process. The -th UT can produce its demodulation output as in (4):\nq T (ν 1,i , ..., ν L,i ) T ⊕ ˜ z ,i = q T Q −1 (c 1,i , ..., c L,i ) T ⊕ ˜ z ,i = c ,i ⊕ ˜ z ,i\nwhich shows that each user can have a point-to-point channel over Z p , with additive noise ˜ z ,i . The achievable rate for UT\nFinally, the achievable rate of RQCoF is maximized by minimizing the entropy H(˜ z ) with respect to A subject to the system matrix Q is invertible over Z p . Instead, we resort to the suboptimal (but much simpler) problem of minimizing the variance of effective noise in (5). That is, the UT ﬁnds the a to minimize the quadratic form a T (SNR −1 I + h h T )a\nwith respect to a ∈ Z L and a = 0. This problem was solved in [6] using the LLL algorithm [7], possibly followed by Phost or Schnorr-Euchner enumeration (see [8]) of the non-zero lattice points in a sphere centered at the origin, with radius equal to the shortest vector found by LLL. Notice that in this way the UTs select their integer coefﬁcients independently, i.e., the full-rank condition is not enforced as a part of the noise variance minimization.\nIn short, the idea underlying RQCoF is that each UT con- verts its own downlink channel into a discrete additive-noise multiple access channel over Z p . Since each UT is interested only in its own message, the CP can precode the messages using zero-forcing linear precoding over Z p , at no transmit power additional cost (unlike linear zero-forcing over R ). It is known that the performance of CoF (and therefore QCoF) is quite sensitive to the channel coefﬁcients, due to the non- integer penalty, since the channel coefﬁcients are not exactly matched to the integer coefﬁcients of linear combinations [5], [6]. The same problem arises in RQCoF (or RCoF), due to their formal equivalence. In [9], it was shown that integer- forcing linear receiver (IFLR) can eliminate this penalty by forcing the effective channel matrix to be integer. Here, we propose a new beamforming strategy named Integer-Forcing Beamforming (IFBF), that produces a similar effect for the downlink.\nWe present the IFBF idea assuming R 0 = ∞, as the dual scheme of IFLR, and consider ﬁnite R 0 later. In IFBF, the precoding matrix B = [b 1 , ..., b L ] T is chosen such that the effective channel matrix HB is integer-valued. Then, RQCoF can be applied as before, to the effective channel matrix HB, incurring no non-integer penalty by construction. In short, IFBF with RQCoF removes the non-integer penalty of RQCoF\nbut introduces a SNR penalty due to the non-unitary precoding matrix B. Although not investigated further in this work, we remark here that a more general scheme can be optimized by trading off the precoder SNR penalty with the RQCoF non-integer penalty, by imposing an approximated integer forcing condition. Further, we extend IFBF to the case of ﬁnite R 0 by using quantization, as done in [2], where CP forwards the quantized sequences to the ATs for which the quantization noise is determined from standard rate-distortion theory bounds. Assuming H invertible, the IFBF scheme is given as follows. For a given A ∈ Z L×L (optimized later), the CP uses the precoding matrix B = H −1 A and the system matrix Q = [A] mod p Z .\nAssuming that Q is full rank over Z p , the CP produces the downlink streams x = {x ,i : i = 1, . . . , n}, for = 1, . . . , L as follows.\n\u2022 The CP encodes the information messages {w ∈ Z k p : = 1, ..., L} using the same liner code C over Z p (i.e.,\nc = w G) where w ∈ Z k p denotes the zero-padded in- formation messages with common length k = max {k }.\n\u2022 The CP precodes the codewords {c ∈ Z n p : = 1, ..., L} using the inverse system matrix Q −1 as in (11) and produces the downlink stream according to (8).\nUsing the predeﬁned B, the CP produces the precoded channel inputs {v ,i : i = 1, . . . , n} using\nand forwards them to the ATs via the wired links. Consistently with our system deﬁnition, we impose a per-antenna power constraint equal to SNR (with suitable normalization). Then, the second moment of x ,i is determined as\nwhich guarantees that the powers of the signal transmitted from the ATs satisfy the power-constraint E [|v ,i | 2 ] ≤ SNR for = 1, ..., L. The received signal at the -th UT is given by\nNotice that thanks to the IFBF the non-integer penalty is equal to zero. From (4), the demodulation output is given by\nu ,i = q T Q −1 (c 1,i , ..., c L,i ) T ⊕ ˜ z ,i = c ,i ⊕ ˜ z ,i ,\nwhich shows a point-to-point channel over Z p . Finally, the achievable rate of IFBF with RQCoF can be obtained by nu- merically computing the entropy of discrete additive noise over Z p corresponding to effective noise ε ∼ N (0, max { b 2 }) (i.e., same for all UTs), where the impact of power constraint is included in the effective noise. The following sum-rate is achievable by IFBF with RQCoF:\nfor any full-rank matrix Q, where ˜ z = m −1 ([Q Λ c (ε] mod Λ s ). From (7), the following sum-rate is achievable by IFBF with RCoF:\nfor any full-rank integer matrix A, where b \u2019s are determined by A.\nFor the case of ﬁnite R 0 , we propose a \u201ccompressed\u201d IFBF (CIFBF) where the CP forwards the quantized channel inputs to the -th AT as follows. From the standard rate distortion theory, we have\n2 ]} (2 2R 0 − 1)\nThe per-antenna power constraint (e.g., E [| ˙v |] ≤ SNR) is guaranteed if we have:\nwhere the second term captures the impact of quantization noise and its variance is\nFinally, the achievable rate of CIFBF with RQCoF can be obtained numerically computing the entropy of discrete ad- ditive noise over Z p corresponding to the effective noise ε ∼ N (0, σ 2 ε ) where the impact of power constraint and quantization noise are included in the effective noise:\nfor any full-rank matrix Q, where ˜ z = m −1 ([Q Λ c (ε )] mod Λ s ). From the (7), the following sum-rate is achievable by CIFBF with RCoF:\nfor any full-rank integer matrix A. Finally, the achievable rate is maximized by minimizing the maximum power- enhancement by appropriately selecting an integer matrix A subject to the full-rank constraint. This problem appears to be a hard problem, and we chose A by minimizing the sum power that can be handled by LLL instead. This approach is veriﬁed to provide good performance for symmetric and near- symmetric conﬁgurations (e.g., Wyner model in (16)). That is, we ﬁnd the A solution of:\nUsing the fact that tr(AB) = tr(BA), the objective func- tion is equivalent to L =1 H −1 a 2 . This problem can be efﬁciently solved using the LLL [7] as follows. For a given lattice Λ = {x = H −1 z : z ∈ Z L }, a reduced basis of lattice is obtained through a unimodular matrix U = [u 1 , ..., u L ] such that Λ = {x = H −1 Uz : z ∈ Z L }, implying that F = H −1 U generates the same lattice but has \u201creduced\u201d columns, i.e., the columns of F have small 2-norm. Since U is a square integer matrix with full-rank, we can choose the a = u . Moreover, we can ﬁnd the optimal A by using Phost or Schnorr-Euchner enumeration (see [8]) to generate the non-zero lattice points in a sphere centered at the origin, with radius equal to max { H −1 u 2 } (that guarantees the existence of desired solution) and using a greedy algorithm to ﬁnd L shortest lattice points among them subject to full-rank constraint (see [1] for more details).\nFor the comparison of various schemes, we consider the Wyner model with L ATs and L UTs for which the received signal at the -th UT is given by\nwhere γ ∈ [0, 1] represents the inter-cell interference level and z ,i ∼ N (0, 1). Thanks to the dual-diagonal structure of the channel matrix, the system matrix is guaranteed to have rank L. An achievable rate of CDPC is equal to the sum-capacity with per-antenna power constraint on the vector broadcast channel with additional quantization noises. This is computed by using an efﬁcient algorithm in [10]. In Fig. 1, it is remarkable that RCoF can outperform other schemes when R 0 ≤ 3 bits per channel use. Furthermore, when γ = 1 (e.g., integer-channel matrix), RCoF achieves the cut-set upper bound such as min{DPC with inﬁnite R 0 , L × R 0 }, showing the better performance than other schemes. In particular when R 0 is sufﬁciently large, CIFBF performs within 0.5 bits per user from CDPC (near-optimal for large R 0 ) and appears to offer a good performance-complexity tradeoff. Not surpris- ingly, RQCoF approaches the performance of RCoF within the shaping loss of ≈ 0.25 bits/symbol, as already noticed in the uplink case [6].\nFor RQCoF, there would be a concern on rank-deﬁciency of system matrix Q in particular when p is small, since every UT\nselects its own linear combination coefﬁcients independently of the other nodes. This problem can be essentially avoided by scheduling, i.e., by selecting groups of users to be served simultaneously such that the corresponding system matrix is full rank. For example, consider a downlink DAS with L ATs and K > L UTs. The scheduler aims at maximizing the computation rate subject to the full rank condition, by selecting a subset of L < L UTs. The q coefﬁcients (rows of the matrix Q) are independently optimized by each UT\nas explained before, and are provided to the CP. By Remark 1, we can compute an achievable user rate (i.e., R for\n= 1, ..., K), which depends solely on the matrix Q and can be pre-computed before the user selection. Notice that this process can be done before performing scheduling algorithm. Let Q(U ) denote the submatrix of Q consisting of the rows q with in the index set U . Then, the user selection problem consists of ﬁnding the user subset U solution of:\nIn the case of Rank(Q) < L, the sum-rate is equal to zero since there is no way to serve L UTs simultaneously. Also, if Rank(Q) = L, the problem (17)-(18) can be considered as the maximization of linear function over matroid constraint and Rado and Edmonds proved that a greedy algorithm ﬁnds an optimal solution [11]. In brief, every step adds one UT to U with maximum achievable rate subject to increasing the rank of system matrix. This process is repeated until |U | = L.\nIn Fig. 2, we consider a downlink DAS with H ∈ R 25×5 , with i.i.d. Gaussian distributed elements ∼ N (0, 1). We computed the average achievable rate with user selection, by Monte Carlo averaging with respect to the random channel matrix. Random selection indicates that 5 UTs are randomly and uniformly chosen out of the 25 UTs. In our simulation we\nassumed that if the resulting system matrix after user selection is rank deﬁcient then the achieved sum-rate of all users is zero, for that speciﬁc channel realization. As shown in Fig. 2, RCoF suffers from rank-deﬁciency when using random selection, although the rank of the resulting 5 × 5 channel matrix over R is equal to 5 with probability 1. In high SNRs, user selection can provide both multiuser diversity and greatly mitigate the problem of rank deﬁciency, even for small p. This is indicated by the fact that the gap from the RCoF is essentially equal to the the shaping loss, as in the case where the full-rank system matrix is guaranteed by assumption."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S.
