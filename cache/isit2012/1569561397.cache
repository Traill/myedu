The prominent advantage of large MIMO system is the im- proving in capacity which is proportional to the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas [1]. As pointed out in the literature [2], [3], placing a large number of antennas is more amenable because the transmitted RF energy can be more sharply focused in space. Therefore, we believe that a large MIMO system would be practical in the near future to support the increasing demand for high data rates in wireless communications.\nConcatenating the MIMO system with channel codes is a methodology to increase reliability and performance of the MIMO system. There has been a tremendous effort to develop the coded MIMO systems, which include code-design, the invention of soft-output detectors, joint detection and decoding techniques and so forth, with the ultimate goal to approach MIMO capacity (see e.g. [4], [5], [6]). We note that almost works have studied the coded MIMO system with less num- ber of transmit/receive antennas (e.g. 2 to 8 transmit/receive antennas). Therefore, lacking in the literature is a performance study of coded large MIMO system.\nTo the best of our knowledge, only large MIMO systems concatenated with turbo code have been studied in [2], [3], [7]. Although the turbo coded large MIMO system mentioned above is very attractive in term of computational complexity but there still exists a signiﬁcant performance gap to the\nMIMO capacity. For example, the gap of the turbo coded MIMO system with 200 transmit/receive antennas from MIMO capacity is more than 7 dB. In this paper, we aim to reduce the remaining gap by considering non-binary low-density parity- check (NBLDPC) codes [8].\nIn this study, we have investigated the application of NBLDPC codes to large MIMO systems which utilize the low- complexity minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection as MIMO detector. We present how the soft-output MMSE detector can straightforwardly work with NBLDPC decoder. We demonstrate that the NBLDPC coded system performs best among other coded schemes at SNR which is near to the large MIMO capacity. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst introduce NBLDPC codes in Section II. In Section III, the system model used for all simulations is described. In Section IV, we explain the soft-output MMSE detector for NBLDPC decoder. In Section V, we present the decoding performance of NBLDPC coded large MIMO systems. This paper is closed with conclusions.\nAn NBLDPC code C over Galois ﬁeld GF(2 m ) is deﬁned by the null-space of a sparse P × N parity-check matrix A = {a ij } deﬁned over GF(2 m ), for i = 1, . . . , P and j = 1, . . . , N\nwhere m > 1 and x = (x 1 , . . . , x N ) is a codeword. The i-th parity-check equation can be written as\nwhere a i1 , . . . , a i1 ∈ GF(2 m ) are the entries of i-th row of A. The parameter N is the codeword length in symbol. Assuming that A is of full rank, the number of information symbols is K = N − P and the code rate is R = K/N.\nWe note that a non-binary symbol which belongs to GF(2 m ) can be represented by the binary sequence of m bits. For each m, we ﬁx a GF(2 m ) with a primitive element α and its primitive polynomial π. Once a primitive element α of GF(2 m ) is ﬁxed, each non-binary symbol is given by an m- bits representation [9, p. 110]. For example, with a primitive element α ∈ GF(2 3 ) such that π(α) = α 3 + α + 1 = 0, each symbol is represented as 0 = (0, 0, 0), 1 = (1, 0, 0),\nα = (0, 1, 0), α 2 = (0, 0, 1), α 3 = (1, 1, 0), α 4 = (0, 1, 1), α 5 = (1, 1, 1) and α 6 = (1, 0, 1). Let L(x) be the binary representation of x ∈ GF(2 m ). For the above example, we can write L(x = α 3 ) = (1, 1, 0). Thus, each coded symbol x i ∈ GF(2 m ), ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N} of a non-binary codeword represents m bits. We also denote n = mN and k = mK as the codeword length and information length in bit, respectively.\nAn NBLDPC code is (d v , d c )-regular if the parity-check matrix of the code has constant column weight d v and row weight d c . The parity-check matrix A can be represented by a Tanner graph with variable and check nodes [10, p. 75]. The belief propagation (BP) algorithm for NBLDPC decoder [8] exchanges the probability vector of length 2 m between variable nodes and check nodes of the Tanner graph at each iteration round ℓ.\nIn this paper, only is the (d v = 2, d c )-regular NBLDPC code deﬁned over GF(2 8 ) considered due to the following reasons :\n1) The process to optimize the parity-check matrix A is not required since this code is empirically known as the best performing code especially for short code length. Moreover, the NBLDPC code with d v = 2 can be encoded in linear time [11].\n2) The high decoding complexity of NBLDPC decoder can be compensated since the A is very sparse [12].\n3) This code seems to offer the best performance for MIMO system with optimal MAP detection [13]. We therefore expect that this code will offer the excellent performance over large MIMO systems. We also note that the performance of NBLDPC codes for MIMO systems with suboptimal detector has not been reported.\nThank to these advantages, the NBLDPC codes have re- cently received an upsurge of research interest from wireless community including the application to MIMO channels [13], [14], [15], [16].\nWe adopt the conventional notation to denote the MIMO system with N t transmit antennas and N r receive antennas as N t × N r MIMO system. Let A M be the complex modulation constellation of size M = 2 p where p represents bit(s) per modulated symbol. In this study, each antenna uses the same modulation scheme and the mapping is a Gray-labelled constellation. Figure 1 shows the spatial multiplexing MIMO system concatenated with an NBLDPC code of rate R deﬁned over GF(2 8 ).\nAt the transmitter side, a bit to symbol mapper maps a group of 8 information bits to a non-binary symbol in GF(2 8 ). The stream of K non-binary symbols is encoded into a codeword of length N symbols through an NBLDPC encoder. Assuming that the dimension of code and modulation is matched, i.e., m can be divided by p, each coded symbol in GF(2 8 ) is then mapped to a group of q = 8/p modulated symbols by a constellation mapper. At each time instant (each channel use), the transmitter simultaneously sends N t = K t q modulated symbols in parallel through N t transmit antennas where K t\nis a number of coded symbols per each transmission. Let s = [s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s N t ] T ∈ C N t be the transmit signal vector. Each entry s i , ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N t } taken from A M must satisfy the component-wise energy constraint E[ ∥s i ∥ 2 ] = E s /N t where E s is the total transmitted power and E[ ·] denotes the expectation. With this energy constraint, a large number of transmit antennas N t imply low power consumption per each transmit antenna.\nConsidering a baseband discrete time model for a ﬂat fading MIMO channel, the received vector y = [y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y N r ] T ∈ C N r of the spatial multiplexing N t × N r MIMO system is given by\nThe matrix H = [H 1 H 2 . . . H N t ] ∈ C N r ×N t denotes the channel fading matrix whose entry h kj is assumed to be complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance E[ ∥h kj ∥ 2 ] = 1. The vector n = [n 1 , n 2 , . . . , n N r ] T ∈ C N r is a noise vector whose entry is a complex white Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance σ 2 n per real component. The MIMO detector performs detection and produces the prior probabilities (soft-output) for NBLDPC decoder. After all N variable nodes are initialized, the NBLDPC decoder performs decoding process and provides the estimated non- binary symbols (hard output). These estimated symbols are ﬁnally demapped to a sequence of estimated information bits. In this paper, the channel matrix H is assumed to be known at the receiver and we only focus on the square channel matrix, i.e. N t = N r .\nSince each entry of H has unit variance, the average signal energy per receive antenna is E s . We follow the convention that N 0 /2 = σ 2 n to deﬁne the signal to noise ratio. In this setting, the average signal to noise ratio (SNR) per receive antenna, denoted by γ, is given by [4]\nThe spectral efﬁciency (transmitted information rate) of coded MIMO system with spatial multiplexing technique is pRN t [4]. With perfect H at the receiver side, ergodic MIMO capacity is given by [1]\nwhere the superscript H denotes the Hermitian transpose operator, det denotes the determinant and I N r is the identity matrix of size N r ×N r . The MIMO capacity deﬁned in (3) can be evaluated via the Monte-Carlo simulation. Both of spectral efﬁciency and capacity are measured in bits/sec/Hz (bps/Hz).\nOne of the major problems that prohibits large MIMO sys- tems from practical implementation is the high computational complexity of MIMO detector. Even with modern and high- speed circuits, the optimal MAP detector is still infeasible. Therefore, many works have recently focused on inventing the low-complexity detectors to enable the use of large scale multiple antennas [17].\nIn this paper, we consider the MMSE detector which is a famous class of linear detection since it has low computational complexity. Based on the complexity analysis provided in [2], the MMSE detector has an average per-bit complexity of O(N t N r ) which is lower than the well-known ZF-SIC (zero- forcing with successive interference cancellation) detector whose average per-bit complexity is O(N 2 t N r ). Several near- optimal MIMO detection algorithms such as sphere detection or lattice reduction-aided detection also exhibit high compu- tational complexity which is much greater than O(N t N r ) [2].\nLet us introduce the MMSE detector and the soft-output generation for NBLDPC decoder. Following [18], a detection estimate ˆ s k of the transmitted symbol on k-th antenna by multiplying y k with the MMSE weight matrix W k\nThis MMSE weight matrix W k is chosen so as to minimize the mean square error between the transmitted symbol s k and ˆ s k . It is important to note that direct computation of the matrix inverse in (5) can be avoided by using Sherman-Morrison- Woodbury formula [19, p. 50]\nThe estimation ˆ s k can be approximated as the output of an equivalent additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel [20]\nwhere µ k = W H k H k and z k is a zero-mean complex Gaussian variable with variance ϵ 2 k = E s N\n(µ k − µ 2 k ). Based on this approximation, the probability of ˆ s k conditioned on s ∈ A M is as follows\nwhere ∥ · ∥ 2 denotes the squared Euclidean norm and κ is the normalized constant such that\nLet p (0) v (x) denote the input of belief propagation (BP) algorithm which is used as NBLDPC decoder where v =\n1, 2, . . . , N and the index in superscript represents the iteration round of BP algorithm. The p (0) v (x) is the probability that v-th coded symbol is likely to be x ∈ GF(2 8 ). We assume that k-th transmit antenna to (k + q − 1)-th transmit antenna are used to send the v-th coded symbol (any coded symbol is mapped to q modulated symbols). The generation of soft-output from MMSE detector for v-th variable node of BP algorithm is as follows.\nwhere ˆ s k+i is the estimation on the (k + i)-th receive an- tenna, s k+i ∈ A M and the eight bits ordered sequence of (s k , s k+1 , · · · , s k+q −1 ) must be equal to the binary represen- tation L(x). According to (8), 2 8 (q − 1) real multiplications for each coded symbols are needed to calculate p (0) v (x) for all x ∈ GF(2 8 ). We note that the computational complexity of generating soft-output for NBLDPC decoder is rather low when comparing to the computation of MMSE matrix. We then use the soft output calculated from (8) to initialize the belief propagation (BP) algorithm employing as NBLDPC decoder [8]. BP algorithm exchanges the probability vector of length 2 m between variable nodes and check nodes of the Tanner graph at each iteration round ℓ.\nIn this section, the performance of NBLDPC coded 600 × 600 MIMO system with MMSE detector (NBLDPC coded system for simplicity) is presented. N t = N r = 600 are chosen in order to compare with the coded performances presented in [2]. The maximum iteration of NBLDPC decoder ℓ max is set to 100 for all simulation results.\nFigure 2 presents the simulation results for 600 ×600 MIMO system. This ﬁgure shows that R = 1/3 and R = 1/2 NBLDPC coded systems operate within 3.4 and 3.6 dB, respectively, from the corresponding MIMO capacities. The turbo coded system with MMSE-LAS detector in [2] is used as the competitor. The performance of this turbo coded system over 600 × 600 MIMO system is away from the capacity by about 9.4 dB. It is obviously seen that R = 1/3 turbo coded system underperforms R = 1/3 NBLDPC coded system by more than 6 dB. More interestingly, R = 1/2 NBLDPC coded system absolutely outperforms R = 1/3 turbo coded system by about 3.4 dB. Therefore, the NBLDPC coded system outperforms the turbo coded system both in term of performance and spectral efﬁciency.\nWe also investigate the BER performance of coded large MIMO system with higher-order modulation. The coded per- formance of 600 ×600 MIMO system with 16-QAM is shown in Fig. 3 and 4. From both ﬁgures, the following observations can be listed as follows :\n\u2022 R = 1/3 and R = 1/2 NBLDPC coded systems with n = 2400 bits operate within 6 dB and 8 dB, respectively, from MIMO capacity.\n\u2022 R = 1/3 and R = 1/2 turbo coded systems [2] operate very far (more than 15 dB) from MIMO capacity. The main factor\nthat contributes to this large gap from capacity is the detector considered in [2] is not soft-output based detector. So, it is not surprising that the NBLDPC coded systems indeed beat turbo coded systems\n\u2022 By increasing the length of code from n = 2400 bits to n = 28800 bits, the coding gain about 0.7 dB can be obtained from R = 1/3 NBLDPC coded system.\n\u2022 For moderate codeword lengths (n = 2400 bits) and the same MMSE detector, R = 1/3 NBLDPC coded systems outperform both the optimized and regular binary LDPC (BLDPC) codes (see Fig. 4). The coding gains obtained over optimized and regular binary LDPC codes are about 0.8 and 2 dB respectively. The regular binary LDPC code has column weight 4 and row weight 6 whereas the optimized binary LDPC code is taken from Table. III in [21] The maximum degree of variable node of selected optimized binary LDPC code is 16. This optimized code can asymptotically perform within 0.19 dB from the capacity of single input single output Rayleigh fading channel.\n\u2022 Another advantage of using NBLDPC code which can be seen from Fig. 4 is the excellent frame error rate (FER). Comparing with optimized BLDPC code, sharp decrease in the FER curve is obtained. Although the BER curve of optimized BLDPC code is good but its corresponding FER curve is quite poor.\nFor binary LDPC coded MIMO system with MMSE de- tector, We compute the input of binary LDPC decoder ac- cording to the expression given in [18]. It is known that the performance of BLDPC coded system can be enhanced by adding the number of iterations between decoder and detector but, for large MIMO systems, this will greatly increase the computational complexity. Thus, the simulation for BLDPC coded system with joint detection and decoding is not carried out.\nAlthough the MMSE detector has very poor detecting performance for MIMO system with N t = N r but in this section we have demonstrated that the application of this detector to NBLDPC coded system is somewhat excellent. Therefore, one may be surprised why MMSE detector yields such good coded performance. Let us take a closer look at the uncoded results shown in Fig. 5. It can be observed that the uncoded performance of MMSE detector for 600 × 600 and 16 × 16 MIMO systems are very similar to those of near- optimal MIMO detectors for low SNR region. Noticeably,\nthose regions are the operating regions for coded systems. By trial and error, we suspect that the key component to achieve good performance from NBLDPC coded system is not a detection part but a soft-output generation. We note that other methodologies for generating soft-output from linear MIMO detection such as the one described in [22, p. 358] leads to seriously degraded performance (not shown here).\nIn this paper, the NBLDPC coded large MIMO systems are studied. The low-complexity MMSE detector is employed to provide the soft-input for NBLDPC decoder. We have demonstrated that the proposed NBLDPC coded system can signiﬁcantly decrease the remaining gap from MIMO capacity which is previously obtained from the best known turbo coded systems. By using moderate length NBLDPC codes (a few thousand bits), the proposed coded system can perform near MIMO capacity which is closest than ever. We therefore conclude that the NBLDPC coded large MIMO system can be one of the best choices to achieve both the excellent BER performance and the ultra high spectral efﬁciency.\nThis work is ﬁnancially supported by the Telecommunica- tions Research Industrial and Development Institute (TRIDI), with National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), Grant No.PHD/009/2552.
