Different from classical block transmission where decoding can only be performed when the whole code- word has been received, delay-universal transmission requires that information symbols can be recovered after any delay, and that their reliability increases with delay. An important perfor- mance measures of delay-universal transmission is the delay- exponent , which is the exponential rate that error probability decays with delay. The achievable delay-exponent has been characterised for point-to-point channels in [2] and for lossless source compression in [3, 4]. Further works has extended the results to the broadcast and multiple access channels [5\u20137]. In these results, the achievable delay-exponent is closely related to the classical Gallager\u2019s error-exponent [8].\nDespite the aforementioned works, limited results are avail- able for relaying networks. An achievable delay-exponent has been derived for the two-hop erasure network, where no direct link is available [9]. Reference [10] proposes a decode-and- forward scheme that can achieve the optimal random-code delay-exponent when errors are detected at the relay, for e.g. when the source-relay link is an erasure channel. On the other hand, when the relay terminal cannot decode the message, a feasible strategy is to compress the relay\u2019s received signal with a source encoder, protect the compressed signal with a channel code and forward it to the destination. In this work, we limit ourselves to lossless compression at the relay terminal.\nWe analyse two transmission strategies using sequential random codes [2]. We ﬁrst consider both source and channel coding at the relay. A maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder is not analytically tractable in this case, we therefore propose and analyse a suboptimal message-truncating decoder. Alter- natively, we consider a system without any source-coding at the relay and an approximate ML decoder. Despite lacking a source code, the system with the approximate ML decoder outperforms the system with message-truncating decoder in most cases. Particularly, when the source-relay channel is symmetric, or when the relay-destination link is good, the gains provided by source coding are not sufﬁcient to offset the loss of suboptimal decoding. When the relay-destination link is noisy, source coding may offer substantial gains in delay-exponent, even with the suboptimal message-truncating decoder. Apart from the achievable bounds for the delay- exponent of relay networks, the analysis gives informative guidelines for system design: whether to omit the source code to facilitate high-performance decoder at the destination, or to use source code and accept a suboptimal decoder.\nConsider delay-universal transmission over a discrete mem- oryless three-terminal relaying network. Information available at the source terminal is encoded and transmitted over the discrete memoryless channel (DMC) W y,z |x , where x is the channel input, y, z are the channel outputs at the destination and relay terminals correspondingly. The relay terminal pro- cesses and forwards its received signal to the destination over an independent DMC W y |w , where w and y are correspond- ingly the channel input and output. The destination attempts to recover the source information based on the received signals.\nIn delay-universal transmission, information sequence is available in real-time at the source terminal. At each time instant t, information symbol s t arrives and a new coded symbol x t is produced from the following encoding function\nwhere x t ∈ X is the signal transmitted by the source terminal. The information rate is R = ln |S| nats per unit time. In this paper, we consider random tree codes studied in [2] where x t = E s t (s t 1 ) ∈ X has distribution Q x (x t ) and x t is independent from E s t (ˆ s t 1 ) if t = t or s t 1 = ˆ s t 1 .\nThe relay sequentially forwards its received sequence to the destination. At time t, the relay terminal receives the channel symbol z t ∈ Z and sequentially (losslessly) compresses the sequence z t 1 ∈ Z t using the following encoding function\nWe consider sequential random binning source coding studied in [4], where w t is uniformly drawn from W. The source code rate is R s = ln |W| ≤ ln |Z|. The relay terminal then protects the sequence w t 1 ∈ W t with a channel code\nThe symbol w t is then transmitted to the destination terminal. Similar to the source terminal, the relay terminal uses random tree codes, where w t follows distribution Q W (w t ).\nAt time t, the destination terminal receives y t 1 from the source terminal and y t 1 from the relay terminal. It ﬁrst decodes y t 1 to recover w t 1 using the following decoding functions 1\n\u2022 Channel decoding: D rc t : Y t → W t ; D rc t (y t 1 ) = w t 1 \u2022 Source decoding: D rs t : W t → Z t ; D rs t (w t 1 ) = z t 1\nThe destination terminal then employs y t 1 and z t 1 to recover the information sequence s t 1 :\nEvaluating Pr {y t 1 , ˆ z t 1 |x t 1 } is essential for ML decoding. A summary of the system model is illustrated in Figure 1.\nIn this paper, we analyse the achievable performance of delay-universal relaying. Particularly, the error probability of a symbol at delay d is deﬁned as\nwhere s t −d (t) = D d t (y t 1 , z t 1 ) t −d . The achievable delay- exponent is\nThe delay-exponent has been characterised for point-to- point delay universal transmission [2].\nLemma 1 (Channel Coding): Consider \t delay-universal transmission over a DMC W y |x (y |x), x ∈ X , y ∈ Y using random tree codes with coded symbol distribution Q x (x). The probability of error at delay d is bounded by\nfor some K > 0, where E c (R, Q x , W y |x ) is the classical Gallager exponent [8]\nLemma 2 (Source Coding): Consider a sequence z t 1 with i.i.d. symbols drawn from Z ∼ p z (z). Consider source coding z t 1 with rate R s using sequential random binning and ML decoding. Then\nFor systems with both source and channel coding, the achievable delay-exponent is given as follows [3].\nConsider delay-universal transmitting a sequence z t 1 with i.i.d symbols drawn from Z ∼ p z (z) over the channel W y |w (y |w) using a concatenating of random binning source coding and random channel coding. Then\nmin E s (p z , R), E c (R, W y |w ) E c (R, W y |w ) = max\nNote that higher delay-exponent may be achieved with joint- source channel codes. However, this remains an open problem.\nThese results are used subsequently in deriving the delay- exponent achievable by Compress-and-Forward (CF) relaying.\nCharacterising the delay-exponent, and error-exponent in general, of relaying networks remains an open problem. For decode-and-forward relaying, large delay is needed for reliable decoding the message at the relay; however, relayed messages with larger delay are less useful in delay-constrained appli- cations [10]. Reference [10] only tackles the challenge for systems where error can be detected at the relay. Similarly in CF relaying, the non-reliability of the relayed message posses the main challenge for delay-exponent analysis.\nIn this section, we derive the delay-exponent achieved by CF relaying. Recall that the destination decoder attempts to recover the information sequence s t 1 based on the symbols y t 1 received from the source terminal and an unreliable represen- tation ˆ z t 1 of the relay message z t 1 . In systems with both source and channel codes at the relay, the optimal ML decoding is not tractable. We therefore propose a message-truncating decoder\nin Section IV-A, which simply truncates and discard the less reliable part of the sequence ˆ z t 1 . For systems without a source code at the relay, we propose and analyse an approximate to the optimal ML decoder in Section IV-B. As we shall see, the approximate ML decoder usually outperforms despite lacking a source code. However, when z t is not equiprobable, source coding may provide substantial gains, even with the suboptimal message-truncating decoder.\nWith both source and channel codes at the relay termi- nal, Pr {y t 1 , ˆ z t 1 |x t 1 } is not analytically tractable. We therefore propose a message-truncating decoder where the destination discards ˆ z t t −k+1 and uses ˆ z t −k 1 as if ˆ z t −k 1 = z t −k 1 (together with y t 1 ) for decoding:\nFollowing lemma 3, the error probability of ˆ z t −k 1 decreases ex- ponentially with the truncation length k. Meanwhile, increas- ing k degrades the performance of D d t y t 1 , ˆ z t −k 1 . Therefore, decoder design involves optimising k. For a given k, the error performance of the decoding technique in (6) is as follows.\nTheorem 1 (Message-truncating decoder): Consider delay- universal transmitting s t 1 with CF over the relaying network described in Section II. With the decoder in (6),\n(9) ˆ E (Q x , R, α) = max\nαE (0) Q x , ρ, W y,z |x − ρR (10) p z (z) =\nProof Sketch: The ﬁrst term of (7) is bounded by K 1 e −kE sc (p z ,W y|w ) . Meanwhile, with ˆ z t −k 1 = z t −k 1 the ex- ponent of the second term of (7) is equivalent to that of a channel with two block, one block of length k with transition probability W y |x and one block of length d − k with tran- sition probability W y,z |x . The error exponent of this term is\nˆ E(Q x , R, d/k) deﬁned in (10). The overall error probability is dominated by the term with the smaller exponent.\nCorollary 1: The achievable delay-exponent of CF relaying over the network described in Section II is bounded by\n(12) Proof: The error exponent is lower bounded by\nE c (R, Q x , W y |x ), which is achieved by ignoring the relaying stream. Furthermore, when d → ∞, optimising k/d in (9) converges to optimising α ∈ [0, 1].\nTruncating the relaying message bring substantial perfor- mance degradation to CF relaying. In this subsection, we consider an approximate to ML decoding. For tractability, we only consider systems without source-coding at the relay terminal. More speciﬁcally, the relay terminal sequentially encodes w t 1 = z t 1 into w t 1 using random codes at rate ln |Z| nats/cu and forwards w t 1 to the destination.\nFor a given transmit sequence x t 1 , we have that Pr y t 1 , ˆ z t 1 |x t 1 =\nFurthermore, without source coding and with sequential ran- dom channel codes, if ˆ z t −j+1 = z t −j+1 then ˆ z t −j+1 is uni- formly distributed in Z\\ {z t −j+1 } and ˆz i , i = t − j + 2, . . . , t are uniformly distributed in Z. Therefore noting that z t 1 ∈ F j (ˆ z t 1 ) implies ˆ z t 1 ∈ F j (z t 1 ), for all z t 1 ∈ F j (ˆ z t 1 ),\nwhere P e (j) is the probability that the ﬁrst error occurs at symbol t − j + 1, which can be bounded using Lemma 1. It follows from (14) that\nIn principle, the decoder can use the transition probability in (16) for ML decoding. For tractability, we consider a suboptimal scheme where an approximation of Pr {y t 1 , z t 1 |x t 1 } is used for sequential decoding,\nWith some manipulation, it can be proved that |Z| − 1\nPr {y t 1 , ˆ z t 1 |x t 1 } Pr (y t 1 , ˆ z t 1 |x t 1 )\nwhere p min min z,x W z |x (z |x). Therefore, for systems with |Z| 1 or with good relay-destination link, the bounds in (19) are tight at large and the proposed decoder can achieve ML decoding. The following delay exponent is achievable.\nTheorem 2: Consider delay-universal relaying using ran- dom codes as described in Section II without source coding at the relay terminal ( w t 1 = z t 1 ). With the decoder described in (17), we have that\nCorollary 2: The achievable delay-exponent of CF relaying over the network described in Section II is bounded by\nFrom (21), the achievable delay-exponent is lower bounded by the direct transmission delay-exponent E c (R, W y |x ) and upper bounded by the fully cooperative delay-exponent E c (R, W y,z |x ), where the destination has full access to z t 1 .\nWhen a non-symmetric channel is observed at the relay terminal, source-coding can signiﬁcantly reduces the rate re- quirements for the relay-destination link. However with source coding, the ML decoding is not yet analytically tractable.\nWe now consider some numerical delay-exponent achieved by CF relaying. We ﬁrst consider CF relaying through a binary symmetric relaying network deﬁned as followed\nwhere W y |x and W z |x are binary symmetric channels (BSC) with transition probability y = z = 0.1. Similarly, the relay- destination channel W y |w is a BSC with transition probability\ny . Furthermore, to facilitate relaying z t 1 without any compres- sion, we allow two channel uses on the relay transmitter for each channel use on the source transmitter.\nFigure 2 illustrates the achievable delay exponents when the relay-destination link is good ( y = 0.03). In this case, it is optimal to relay z t 1 to the destination, and thus the approximate ML decoder performs close to optimality. This observation is clearly illustrated in Figure 2 where E ml (R) is close to the fully cooperative upper-bound E c (R, W y,z |x ) for all rates R.\nHowever, when the relay-destination link degrades, the delay-exponent achieved by approximate ML decoding di- verges from the upper bound E c (R, W y,z |x ). Figure 3 illus- trates the achievable delay-exponent at R = 0.2 for various transition probability y of the relay-destination link. The gaps between E ml (R) and E c (R, W y,z |x ) suggest that both achievable delay-exponents E ml and E tr are signiﬁcantly suboptimal, especially at large y . One possible method to improve their performance is to lossily compress z t 1 prior to relaying. Lossy compression is outside the scope of the paper.\nFigures 2 and 3 illustrate that the approximate ML decoder without source coding outperforms the message-truncating de- coder. This observation is true for symmetric channels, where source-coding at the relay does not bring signiﬁcant gains, and thus the superior approximate ML decoder outperforms the message-truncating decoder. However, when the channel\nis non-symmetric, the performance gains offered by source- coding may overcome the performance loss resulting from the suboptimal message-truncating decoder. Figures 4 and 5 plot the achievable delay-exponent for the same relaying network as in Figures 2 and 3, except that W z |x is now a non-symmetric Z-channel with W z |x (1 |0) = 0, W z |x (0 |1) = z = 0.5 and that y = 0.2. In this setting, E c (ln |Z|, W y |w ) ≈ 0, thus it follows from Theorem 2 that the delay-exponent achieved without source-coding is approximately that achieved by direct transmission. Source-coding decreases the rate requirement for the relay-destination link, leading to gains in the achievable delay-exponent, even with a suboptimal destination decoder. In Figure 4, the message-truncating method outperforms approx- imate ML decoding for R ≥ 0.1. Similarly in Figure 5, the message-truncating method outperforms ML decoding without\nWe have derived achievable bounds for the delay-exponent of CF relaying over a three-terminal network. Two trans- mission techniques are compared: a suboptimal destination decoder with source-coding at the relay, and a near-optimal destination decoder without source-coding at the relay. Our analysis shows that the later scheme is superior to the former one, except for networks with a non-symmetric source-relay link and a bad relay-destination link. The analysis provides guidelines for system design, highlighting how one should tradeoff signal processing complexity between the transmitter and the receiver in delay-universal relaying."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A.
