It was shown that a network has a scalar linear network coding solution if and only if it is matroidal associated with a representable matroid. The current work attempts to establish a connection between matroid theory and network-error correcting codes. In a similar vein to the theory connecting matroids and network coding, we abstract the essential aspects of network-error correcting codes to arrive at the deﬁnition of a matroidal error correcting network. An acyclic network (with arbitrary sink demands) is then shown to possess a scalar linear error correcting network code if and only if it is a matroidal error correcting network associated with a representable matroid. Therefore, constructing such network- error correcting codes implies the construction of certain repre- sentable matroids that satisfy some special conditions, and vice versa."},"body":{"text":"Matroids are discrete objects which abstract the notions of linear dependence among vectors. The relationship between network coding (introduced in [1]) and matroid theory was ﬁrst introduced in [2] and further developed in [3]. The authors of [2], [3] showed that the scalar linear solvability of a network with a given set of demands was related to the existence of a representable matroid (matroids which arise from matrices over ﬁelds) satisfying certain properties.\nIn the current work, we present the connection between matroids and network-error correcting codes, which was in- troduced in [4] and further developed in [5]. The results of this work may be considered as the network-error correction counterparts of some of the results of [2], [3]. We deﬁne the notion of a matroidal error correcting network associated with a particular matroid. Using this deﬁnition, we show that a network has a scalar linear network-error correcting code if and only if there exists a representable matroid M such that the given network is a matroidal error correcting network associated with M. Therefore, networks with scalar network-error correcting codes are shown to be analogous to representable matroids satisfying a certain set of properties.\nNotations: The following notations will be followed throughout the paper. A ﬁnite ﬁeld is denoted by the symbol F. For some positive integer k, the identity matrix of size k over F is denoted by I k . The transpose of a matrix A over F is denoted by A T . The space spanned by the columns of a matrix A over F is denoted by cols(A). The support set of a vector x and its Hamming weight are denoted by supp(x) and w H (x) respectively. The symbol 0 represents an all zero vector or matrix of appropriate size indicated explicitly or known according to the context. For some matrix A, we denote\nby A l the l th column of A, and for a subset L of the column indices of A, we denote by A L the submatrix of A with columns indexed by L. Likewise, we denote by A j the j th row of A, and by A J the submatrix of A with rows given by the subset J of the row indices.\nAn expanded version of this paper is available in [8] with all the proofs, additional results, and examples.\nAs in [4], [6], we model the directed acyclic network as a directed acyclic multigraph (one with parallel edges) G(V, E ) where V is the set of vertices of G representing the nodes in the network and E is the set of edges representing the links in the network. An ancestral ordering is assumed on E as the network is acyclic. Each edge is assumed to carry at most one ﬁnite ﬁeld symbol at any given time instant. A non-empty subset S ⊆ V, called the set of sources, generates the information that is meant for the sinks in the network, represented by another non-empty subset T ⊆ V. Each sink demands a particular subset of the information symbols generated by the sources. Any node in the network can be a source and a sink simultaneously, however not generating and demanding the same information. Let n s i be the number of information symbols (from some ﬁnite ﬁeld F) generated at source s i . Let µ = 1, 2, ..., |S| i=1 n s i = n denote the ordered index set of messages (each corresponding to a particular information symbol) generated at all the sources. For each edge e ∈ E, we denote by tail(e) the node from which e is outgoing, and by head(e) the node to which e is incoming. Also, for each node v ∈ V, let In(v) denote the union of the messages (a subset of µ) generated by v and the set of incoming edges at v. Similarly, let Out(v) denote the union of the subset of messages demanded by v and the set of outgoing edges from v. For any e ∈ E, we denote by In(e) the set In(tail(e)).\nA network code on G is a collection of functions, one asso- ciated with each node of the network mapping the incoming symbols at that node to its outgoing symbols. When these functions are scalar linear, the network code is said to be a scalar linear network code. In other words, a scalar linear network code is an assignment to the following matrices.\n\u2022 A matrix A s i of size n s i ×|E|, for each source s i ∈ S, i = 1, 2, ..., |S|, denoting the linear combinations taken by the sources mapping information symbols to the network.\n\u2022 A matrix K of size |E| × |E| which indicates the linear combinations taken by the nodes in the network to map incoming symbols to outgoing symbols.\nFor more details on these matrices, we refer the reader to [6]. Also, to each sink t ∈ T , we associate a matrix B t of size |E| × n t , where n t is the number of incoming edges at t. Corresponding to the n t rows that index these incoming edges, we ﬁx the n t × n t submatrix of B t as an identity submatrix. The other entries of B t are ﬁxed as zeroes.\nFor i = 1, 2, ..., |S|, let x s i ∈ F n si be the row vector representing the information symbols at source s i . Let F =\nI |E| − K −1 . Let A be the n × |E| row-wise concatenated matrix\nThe columns of AF are known as the global encoding vectors corresponding to the edges of the network, indicating the particular linear combinations of the information symbols which ﬂow in the edges. We assume that no edge is assigned an all zero global encoding vector, for then it can simply be removed from the network and a smaller graph can be assumed. The global encoding vector corresponding to the n messages are ﬁxed to be the n standard basis vectors over F. A network code can also be speciﬁed completely by specifying global encoding vectors for all edges in the network, provided that they are valid assignments, i.e., global encoding vectors of outgoing edges are linear combinations of those of incoming edges.\nLet x = x s 1 x s 2 ... x s |S| be the vector of all infor- mation symbols. Let D t ⊆ µ denote the set of demands at sink t, and let x s Dt denote the subvector of the super-vector x corresponding to the information symbols indexed by D t .\nAn edge is said to be in error if its input symbol and output symbol (both from F) are not the same. We call this as a network-error . We model the network-error as an additive error from F. A network-error vector is a |E| length row vector over F, whose components indicate the additive errors on the corresponding edges. The case of multicast network-error correction, where a single source multicasts all its symbols to all sinks in the presence of errors, has been discussed in several papers (see for example, [4], [5]) all being equivalent in some sense. Network-error correction was extended to case of non-multicast in [7]. Here, we brieﬂy review the results for network-error correcting codes in the case of arbitrary number of sources and sinks with arbitrary demands.\nLet z be the network-error vector corresponding to a par- ticular instance of communication in the network. Let F S,t be the matrix AF B t . Let F B t = F t . Then a sink t receives the n t length vector y t = xF S,t + zF t .\nA network code which enables every sink to successfully recover the desired information symbols in the presence of any network-errors in any set of edges of cardinality at most α is said to be a α network-error correcting code. It is not difﬁcult to see that a scalar linear network code is a scalar linear α network-error correcting code if and only if the following condition holds at each sink t ∈ T .\nThe error pattern corresponding to a network-error vector z is deﬁned as its support set supp(z), which we shall also alternatively refer to using the corresponding subset of E . Let F supp(z),t denote the submatrix of F t consisting of those rows of F t which are indexed by supp(z). The condition (2) can then be rewritten as\n∀ ¯ z ∈ F 2α , ∀ supp(z) ∈ {F ⊆ E : |F | = 2α} . (3) A. A technical lemma\nWe now present a technical lemma, which will be used in Section IV.\nLemma 1: Let I D t denote the (n + 2α) × |D t | matrix with a |D t | × |D t | identity submatrix in |D t | of the ﬁrst n rows corresponding to the demands D t at sink t, and with all other elements being zero. For some supp(z) ∈ {F ⊆ E : |F | = 2α} , the condition\nTherefore a given network code is α network-error correcting if and only if the above condition holds for all supp(z) ∈ {F ⊆ E : |F | = 2α} at all sinks t ∈ T .\nIn this section, we provide some basic deﬁnitions and results from matroid theory that will be used throughout this paper. For more details, the reader is referred to [9].\nDeﬁnition 1: Let E be a ﬁnite set. A matroid M on E is an ordered pair (E, I), where the set I is a collection of subsets of E satisfying the following three conditions\n3) If X 1 and X 2 are in I and |X 1 | < |X 2 |, then there is an element e of X 2 − X 1 such that X 1 ∪ e ∈ I.\nThe set E is called the ground set of the matroid and is also referred to as E(M). The members of set I (also referred to as I(M)) are called the independent sets of M. A maximal independent subset of E is called a basis of M, and the set of all bases of M is denoted by B(M). The set I(M) is then obtained as I(M) = {X ⊆ B : B ∈ B(M)} . A subset of E which is not in I is called a dependent set. With M, a function called the rank function is associated, whose domain is the power set 2 E and codomain is the set of non-negative integers. The rank of any X ⊆ E in M, denoted by r M (X), is deﬁned as the maximum cardinality of a subset of X that is a member of I(M). We denote r M (E(M)) = r(M).\nDeﬁnition 2: The vector matroid associated with a matrix A over F, denoted by M[A], is deﬁned as the ordered pair (E, I) where E consists of the set of column labels of A, and I consists of all the subsets of E which index columns that are linearly independent over F. An arbitrary matroid M is said to be F-representable if it is isomorphic to a vector\nmatroid associated with some matrix A over F. The matrix A is then said to be a representation of M. The rank function of a representable matroid M, given by r M (X), X ⊆ E is therefore equal to the rank of the submatrix of columns corresponding to X in the matrix A to which the matroid is associated.\nLemma 2 ( [9]): Let M = M[A], A being some matrix over F. The matroid M remains unchanged if any of the following operations are performed on A\n\u2022 Replace a row by the sum of that row and another. \u2022 Adjoin or delete a zero row.\nBy the row operations of Lemma 2, it is clear that any F- representable matroid can be expressed as the vector matroid of a matrix of the form I r(M) A r(M)×(|E(M)|−r(M)) , with elements from F.\nDeﬁnition 3: Let M be a matroid on E and T ⊆ E. Consider the set I\nwhere B T ⊆ T is a maximal independent subset within T. Then I satisﬁes the axiom for the set of independent sets of a matroid with ground set E − T. We call this matroid as the contraction of T from M, denoted as M/T.\nThe contraction of a F-representable matroid is also F- representable. Let M[A] be the vector matroid associated with a matrix A over F. Let e be a non-zero column of A. Suppose using the elementary row operations listed in Lemma 2, we transform A to obtain a matrix A which has a single non- zero entry in column e. Let A / {e} denote the matrix which is obtained by deleting the row and column containing the only non-zero entry of e. Then M[A]/ {e} = M[A / {e}].\nDeﬁnition 4: Let M be a matroid on E and X be a subset of E. The closure of X is then deﬁned to be the set cl M (X) = {x ∈ E : r M (X ∪ x) = r M (X)} .\nIn this section, we introduce matroidal error correcting networks by extending the deﬁnition of matroidal networks of [2] for the case of networks where errors occur.\nDeﬁnition 5: Let G(V, E ) be an acyclic network with a collection of sources S with message set µ (with n elements) and sinks T , and a given topological order on E . Let α ≤ |E| be a non-negative integer, and F = {F ⊆ E : |F | = 2α} be the collection of error patterns of size 2α. Let M be a matroid over a ground set E with n + 2|E| elements, and with r(M) = n + |E |. The network G is said to be a matroidal α error correcting network associated with M, if there exists a function f : µ∪E → E(M) such that the following conditions are satisﬁed.\n(B) For some basis B of M obtained by extending f (µ) (where B − f (µ) = b n+1 , ..., b n+|E| is ordered accord- ing to the given topological order on E ), the following conditions should hold for all e i ∈ E, taken in the given topological order.\n= r M (f (In(e i ))) + r M (b n+i ) = r M (f (In(e i ))) + 1.\n(C) For each error pattern F = {e i 1 , e i 2 , ..., e i 2α } ∈ F, let B F = B −f (µ)−{b n+i 1 , b n+i 2 , ..., b n+i 2α } . Let M F be the n+2α+|E| element matroid M/B F . Let f F : µ∪E → E(M F ) be a function such that f F (x) = f (x), ∀ x ∈ µ ∪ E . Then, at every sink t ∈ T , for each F ∈ F, we must have\nwhere In E (t) ⊆ In(t) denotes the set of incoming edges at sink t and D t is the set of demands at t.\nRemark 1: In Condition (C) of Deﬁnition 5, the condition f F (x) = f (x) for all x ∈ µ∪E requires that all f (x), x ∈ µ∪E exist in E(M F ) in the ﬁrst place. However, this is ensured by Condition (B1). To see this, ﬁrst we note that f (µ) ⊂ E(M F ) because these elements are in B and are not contracted out of M. Now consider the set f (e) ∪ (B − f (µ)) for any e ∈ E, which is independent in M because of Condition (B1). By (5) in the deﬁnition of the contraction of a matroid, we have that f (e) exists and is also not dependent in M F . Therefore, f F is well deﬁned. As f F (x) = f (x) for all x ∈ µ ∪ E, we shall use f to denote f F also.\nWe now present the main result of this paper which is the counterpart of the results from [2], [3] which relate networks with scalar linearly solvable network codes to representable matroids.\nTheorem 1: Let G(V, E ) be an acyclic communication net- work with sources S and sinks T . The network G is a matroidal α error correcting network associated with a F- representable matroid if and only if it has a scalar linear network-error correcting code over F that can correct any α network-errors.\nProof: If part: Suppose there exists a scalar linear α network-error correcting code over F for G with the matrices A s i (i = 1, 2, ..., |S|), F and B t , t ∈ T , as deﬁned in Section II, according to the given topological ordering on E . Let A be the matrix as in (1).\nLet X be the row-wise concatenated matrix AF F \t of size (n + |E|) × |E |, and Y be the column-wise concatenated matrix I n+|E| X . Also, let M = M[Y], the vector matroid associated with Y, with E(M) being the set of column indices of Y. Let f : E ∪ µ → E(M) be the function deﬁned as follows.\nWe shall now prove the matroid M and function f satisfy the conditions of the theorem. Towards this end, ﬁrst we see that Condition (A) holds by deﬁnition of function f.\nTo see that Condition (B1) holds, consider the basis B = {1, 2, ..., n + |E|}, i.e., the ﬁrst n + |E| columns of Y. Then\nwe have that Y n+|E|+i / ∈ cols(Y B−f (µ) ), because no edge is assigned a zero-global encoding vector, i.e., no column of AF is non-zero. Thus Condition (B1) holds.\nTo show Condition (B2), ﬁrst note that because the given set of coding coefﬁcients for the network is a (valid) network code, F is such that\n  \n   \nwhere 1 j is a column vector in F |E| with all zeros except for the j th entry which is 1 ∈ F. Also, (6) implies that\n  \n   \n  \n   \n  \n   \n  \n   \nwhere Y n+j corresponds to b n+j ∈ B − f (µ) and the non-zero coefﬁcients of A j can occur only in those po- sitions corresponding to the set of messages generated at tail(e j ), if any, which is a subset of In(tail(e j )). Moreover, Y n+j / ∈ cols Y f (In(e j )) , because the (n + j) th row of Y f (In(e j )) is all-zero because of the topological ordering in the acyclic network. Thus Y n+|E|+j ∈ cols Y f (In(e j ))∪b n+j . This proves that Condition (B2) holds.\nNow we prove that Condition (C) also holds. Let I(F ) = {i 1 , i 2 , ..., i 2α } be the index set following the topological ordering corresponding to an arbitrary error pattern F ∈ F and let the set {n + i 1 , n + i 2 , ..., n + i 2α } be denoted as n+I(F ). First we note that by deﬁnition, M F is the vector matroid of the matrix\nBut according to Section II, we have, AF f (In E (t)) = F S,t , and F f (In E (t)) I(F ) \t = F supp(z),t , where supp(z) = F . By Lemma 1, as the given network code is α network-error correcting, we must have I D t ⊆ cols Z f (In E (t)) , where D t ⊆ µ is the set of demands at t. But then I D t = Z f (D t ) . This proves Condition (C) for sink t. The choice of error pattern and sink being arbitrary, this proves the If part of the theorem.\nOnly If part: Let M be the given F-representable matroid, along with the function f, and basis B = f (µ) ˙ ∪ b n+1 , b n+2 , ..., b n+|E| that satisfy the given set of conditions. Let Y = (I n+|E| X ) be a representation of M over F, such that B = {1, 2, ..., n + |E|} . First we prove the following claim.\nClaim: There exists a n × |E| matrix A, and a |E| × |E | matrix F of the form F = (I |E| − K) −1 for some strictly upper-triangular matrix K, such that\nConsider an edge e j ∈ E. Let µ tail(e j ) denote indices of the set of messages generated at tail(e j ). As Condition (B2) holds, Y f (e j ) is such that\nfor some a i,j and c i,j in F. Rearranging these terms, and due to the topological ordering, we must have for some c i,j and a i,j in F,\nAs Condition (B1) holds, we must have at least one c i,j = 0, ∀i = 1, 2, ..., n and because of Condition (B2), we must have a j,j = a j,j = 0. This structure of Y f (e j ) also implies that Y f (e j ) = Y b , for any b ∈ B. Moreover, we also see that Y f (e i ) = Y f (e j ) , for any distinct pair e i , e j of edges in E . Arranging all the Y f (e i ) s in the given topological order (i.e., with f (e j ) = n + |E | + j), we get Y f (E) = X , and\nwhere J comprises of the elements c i,j , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ |E| and L is the matrix\n  \n  \nBy Lemma 2, the matroid M does not change if some row or some column of Y = (I n+|E| X ) is multiplied by a non-zero element of F. Let Y be the matrix obtained from Y by multiplying the rows {n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + |E|} by the elements a −1 1,1 , a −1 2,2 , ..., a −1 |E|,|E| respectively, and\nthen multiplying the columns {n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + |E|} by a 1,1 , a 2,2 , ..., a |E|,|E| respectively. The matrix Y is then of\n, L being the upper-triangular matrix obtained from L, i.e.,\n  \n  \nAs M is the vector matroid of Y also, without loss of generality we assume that Y = Y , with a 1,1 = a 2,2 = ... =\nNow let H be the n × |E | matrix whose columns are populated as follows. For all j = 1, 2, ..., |E|,\nWe shall now show that J j = HL j , ∀ j = 1, 2, ..., |E |. Clearly for any edge e j such that In(e j ) ⊂ µ, (such edges exist because of acyclicity of G), we have J j = HL j , as L j is the basis vector which picks the j th column of H, which is equal to J j . We now use induction on j (according to the topological order) to show that J j = HL j , ∀ j = 1, 2, ..., |E |. Now assume that for some e j , all e i ∈ In(e j ) are such that J i = HL i . By (9), we have\n  \n   \nwhere the second equality above follows from the induction assumption and the deﬁnition of H j , 1 j is a column vector of length |E| with all zeros except for the 1 at j th position, and the last equality follows from (9). Thus we have J j = HL j . Continuing the induction on j, we have that J j = HL j , ∀ j = 1, 2, .., |E |. Therefore, we have X = HL L \t . Thus, with A = H, and F = L, we have that X is of the form as in (8). This proves the claim.\nWe ﬁnally show that there is a scalar linear α network-error correcting code for G. Let the matrices A s i , i = 1, 2, ..., |S| be obtained according to (1) with H = A, and let the network coding matrix K = I − L −1 . Then, the columns of the matrix HL denote the global encoding vectors of the edges of E in the given topological order. Clearly this is a valid network code for G, by the structure of the matrices H and L.\nFor some arbitrary error pattern, F ∈ F, M F (as in Condition (C)) is clearly the vector matroid of the matrix\nBy Condition (C), we have Z f (D t ) ⊆ cols(Z f (In E (t)) ). But we have by the notations of Section II, for supp(z) = F\n. As the choice of sink and error pattern was arbitrary, using Lemma 1 it is seen that the network code given by the column vectors of HL is α network-error correcting. This completes the proof of the theorem.\nExploiting the analogy between matroids and network error correcting codes shown in this work, we present a construction of matroidal error correcting multicast and multiple-unicast networks in [8]. Using this construction, a MATLAB algorithm is used in [8] to generate multicast and multiple-unicast networks with scalar linear network error correcting codes. Following techniques similar to [2], it might be possible to show that there exists networks where linear network codes prove insufﬁcient to provide the demanded error correction.\nThis work was supported partly by the DRDO-IISc program on Advanced Research in Mathematical Engineering through a research grant and partly by the INAE Chair Professorship grant to B.
