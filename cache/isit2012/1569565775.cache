In general, we may take A = {0, 1, . . . , q −1}, and if needed, some additional structure is assumed, e.g., A = Z q or A = F q . The most commonly discussed channel model is the uniform symmetric channel, that is, an error a → b happens with equal probability for any a, b ∈ A and a ≠ b. Error-correcting codes for these channels are extensively studied, see, for instance, [2].\nHowever, in some other systems, such as some data storing systems including ﬂash memories [3], [4] and optical commu- nication [5], the probability of the error a → b is no longer independent of a and b and might vary a lot. If some errors of low probability are neglected, some of those channels can be modeled as \u2018asymmetric channels\u2019.\nMore precisely, let the alphabet be A = {0, 1, . . . , q − 1} ⊂ Z with the ordering 0 < 1 < 2 < ⋯ < q − 1. A channel is called asymmetric if any transmitted symbol a is received as b ≤ a. For example, for q = 2, the symbol 0 is always received correctly while 1 may be received as 0 or 1. The corresponding channel is called Z-channel, see Fig. 1. For q > 2, one can have different types of asymmetric channels [6].\nCoding problems for asymmetric channels were discussed by Varshamov in 1965 [1]. For the characterization of codes for these channels, we need the following.\nDeﬁnition 1 (see [1], [7], [8]): For x, y ∈ A n , where x = (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ) and y = (y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y n ), let\n(ii) N (x, y) ∶= ∑ n i =1 max {y i − x i , 0 }, and (iii) ∆ (x, y) ∶= max{N(x, y), N(y, x)}.\nHere w (x) is the weight of x, and ∆(x, y) is called the asymmetric distance between x and y. If x is sent and y is received, we say that w (x − y) errors have occurred. Note that w (x − y) ≥ 0 for asymmetric channels.\nIn this model, a code correcting t-errors is called a t- code [8]. The following theorem naturally follows.\nTheorem 2 (see [8]): A set C ⊂ A n is a t-code if and only if ∆ (x, y) > t for all x, y ∈ C, x ≠ y.\nApparently, any code which can correct t errors on a sym- metric channel will also be capable of correcting t asymmetric errors, but the converse is not true in general. However, Varshamov showed that almost all linear binary codes which are able to correct t errors for the Z-channel are also able to correct t symmetric errors [1]. Therefore, in order to construct good codes for the Z-channel, nonlinear constructions are needed. Varshamov and Tenengol\u2019ts [9], followed by Con- stantin and Rao [10], constructed families of 1-codes for the Z-channel with size ≥ 2 n n +1 . These codes are constructed based on an Abelian group G for which the group operation is denoted by \u2018 +\u2019 and the identity of G is denoted by 0 G or just 0.\nDeﬁnition 3 (Constantin-Rao (CR) codes): Let G be an Abelian group of order n +1 and identity 0 G . For ﬁxed g ∈ G, the CR code C g is given by\nwhere g 1 , g 2 , . . . , g n are the non-identity elements of G, x i ∈ {0, 1}, and the product x i g i is deﬁned in the canonical way 1g i = g i and 0g i = 0 G .\nIf the group G is a cyclic group of order n + 1, then the corresponding codes are Varshamov-Tenengol\u2019ts (VT) codes\n[9] (denoted by V g ). It is known that the largest Constantin- Rao code of length n is the code C 0 based on the group G = ⊕ p ∣(n+1) ⊕ n p i =1 Z p , where n +1 = Π p ∣(n+1) p n p is the prime factorization of n + 1 and ⊕ denotes the direct product of groups (see [8]). These VT-CR codes have better rates than the corresponding single-error-correcting codes for the binary symmetric channel for all lengths n apart from n = 2 r − 1, where the binary Hamming codes are perfect.\nThese VT-CR codes have a direct generalization to the nonbinary case. The modiﬁcation of Deﬁnition 3 is to let x i ∈ A = {0, 1, . . . , q − 1} and require that the order of g i is at least q. The resulting nonlinear codes have cardinality ∣C g ∣ ≥ q n n +1 , and hence for q > 3 and all lengths n, they are larger than the best single-error-correcting symmetric codes of the same length. The construction can also be generalized to the case of t-codes with t > 1, for both binary and nonbinary alphabets [8].\nSome other constructions for designing single-error-correct- ing codes for the Z-channel have also been introduced. In particular the partition method based on a similar technique building large length constant weight codes from smaller length, together with some heuristics search give good lower bounds for small length codes with n ≤ 25 [11]\u2013[14]. Never- theless, the VT-CR construction remains the best systematical construction of binary 1-codes to date, and the situation is similar for the nonbinary case.\nIn this paper, we present new constructions of codes for asymmetric channels for both binary and nonbinary alphabets, based on methods of generalized code concatenation. For the binary asymmetric channel, our methods construct nonlinear 1-codes from ternary outer codes which are better than the VT- CR codes. For nonbinary asymmetric channels, our methods yield linear codes for many lengths and distances, which outperform the linear codes of the same lengths capable of correcting the same number of symmetric errors. For certain lengths, our construction gives linear codes with equal cardi- nality as the nonlinear VT-CR codes.\nTo discuss our new construction for asymmetric codes based on the generalized concatenation method, we start with the binary case. For a review of generalized concatenated codes, see [15].\nTo construct 1-codes for the Z-channel, we ﬁrst partition all two-bit strings {00, 01, 10, 11} into three 1-codes, which are C 0 = {00, 11}, C 1 = {01}, C 2 = {10}. Then we further ﬁnd some outer codes over the alphabet {0 , 1 , 2 } (i.e. ternary outer codes). Each code symbol is encoded into each of the 1-codes by i ↦ C i . To be more precise, deﬁne a binary to ternary map ˜ S, which maps two bits to one trit.\nThe encoding i → C i is then given by the inverse map of ˜ S. Note that ˜ S is not one-to-one. So for the ternary symbol\n0 the inverse map gives the two binary codewords 00 and 11, while for 1 and 2 we get the unique codewords 01 and 10, respectively.\nNote that for a binary code of length n = 2m, by choosing a pairing of coordinates, the map ˜ S m ∶ F 2m 2 → F m 3 takes a given binary code of length 2m to a ternary code of length m. On the other hand, Deﬁnition 5 can be naturally extended as well, i.e., the map S m takes a given ternary code of length m to a binary code of length 2m. The map S m hence speciﬁes the encoding of an outer ternary code into the inner codes C i .\nFor a better understanding of the maps ˜ S m and S m , we look at some examples.\nExample 6: By starting from the ternary outer code of length n = 3 with the codewords 000 , 111 , 122 , 212 , 221 , the map S 3 yields the binary code C (6) with the 12 codewords\n000000, 000011, 001100, 001111, 110000, 110011, 111100, 111111, 010101, 011010, 100110, 101001.\n(4) The code C (6) has asymmetric distance 2, hence correcting one asymmetric error. This is known to be an optimal 1-code for n = 6 [8].\nBy starting from the linear ternary code [4, 2, 3] 3 with generators 0111 , 1012 , the map S 4 yields the binary code C (8) with 32 codewords. C (8) has asymmetric distance 2, hence correcting one asymmetric error. We observe that C (8) is exactly the CR code C 0 of length n = 8 constructed from the group Z 3 ⊕Z 3 , which hints some relationship between the ternary construction and CR codes. We will discuss this in more detail in Sec. IV.\nCombining the action of the channel Z ×Z and the map ˜ S, we obtain the ternary channel T as shown in middle of Fig. 1. Note that T is different from the ternary symmetric channel R 3 , which is also shown in Fig. 1.\nTheorem 7: If C \u2032 is a single-error-correcting ternary code of length m for the channel T , then C = S m (C \u2032 ) is a 1-code of length 2m.\nProof: For any two codewords c \u2032 1 , c \u2032 2 ∈ C \u2032 , we need to show that the asymmetric distance between S m (c \u2032 1 ) and S m (c \u2032 2 ) is at least two.\nBy construction, if the Hamming distance between c \u2032 1 and c \u2032 2 is at least three, then the Hamming distance between\nS m (c \u2032 1 ) and S m (c \u2032 2 ) is also at least three. Hence the asym- metric distance between S m (c \u2032 1 ) and S m (c \u2032 2 ) is at least two.\nIf the Hamming distance between c \u2032 1 and c \u2032 2 is two, then the following ten pairs of ternary words can be uniquely decoded if a single error happens in the channel T × T :\nAgain, the asymmetric distance between the images of each pair under S 2 is at least two.\nCorollary 8: If C \u2032 is an (m, K, 3) 3 code, then S m (C \u2032 ) is a 1-code of length 2m.\nTheorem 9: Let C \u2032 be a ternary code of length m with homogeneous weight enumerator\nwhere wgt (c \u2032 ) denotes the Hamming weight of c \u2032 . Then C = S m (C \u2032 ) has cardinality ∣C∣ = W C \u2032 (2, 1).\nProof: By Deﬁnition 5, for every zero in the codeword c \u2032 the corresponding pair in the binary codeword can take two different values. Hence ∣S m (c \u2032 )∣ = 2 m −wgt(c \u2032 ) .\nTheorem 7 only works for designing 1-codes of even length. So we generalize this construction to odd length, starting from \u2018adding a bit\u2019 to the ternary code.\nTheorem 10: If C \u2032 is a single-error-correcting code of length m + 1 for the channel Z × T m , then C = S m (C \u2032 ) is a 1-code of length 2m + 1, where S m acts on the last m coordinates of C \u2032 .\nProof: First note that the combined channel Z × T m has a mixed input alphabet. Hence the ﬁrst coordinate in C is binary while the others are ternary. For any two codewords c \u2032 1 , c \u2032 2 ∈ C \u2032 , we need to show that the asymmetric distance between S m (c \u2032 1 ) and S m (c \u2032 2 ) is at least two.\nAgain, if the Hamming distance between c \u2032 1 and c \u2032 2 is at least three, then the distance between S m (c \u2032 1 ) and S m (c \u2032 2 ) is also at least three. Hence the asymmetric distance between S m (c \u2032 1 ) and S m (c \u2032 2 ) is at least two.\nIf the Hamming distance between c \u2032 1 and c \u2032 2 is two, the case that the positions where they differ does not involve the ﬁrst coordinate has already been covered in the proof of Theorem 7. So assume that the ﬁrst coordinate is a bit and the second is a trit. There are the two pairs 01 , 12 and 12 , 11 which can correct a single error on Z × T . The corresponding images of each pair under S m give binary codewords of asymmetric distance two.\nIn the following, we compare nonlinear binary codes for the Z-channel which are the image of ternary linear codes (\u201c F 3 -linear codes\u201d), and linear binary codes. For this, we compare the rate of 1-codes for various length. The ratio of the rates is given by s = log 2 ∣T ∣/ log 2 ∣B∣, where ∣T ∣ and ∣B∣ are the cardinalities of the nonlinear binary 1-code from a linear\nternary code T of Hamming distance three, and a linear binary code B of Hamming distance three, respectively.\nFrom Table I we see that for certain lengths, the 1-codes obtained from ternary linear codes indeed encode more bits than the corresponding linear binary codes. In particular, for n = 8 the 1-code of cardinality 32 encodes one bit more than the linear binary code of size 16. Also, the 1-codes of length 64 through 80 outperform the corresponding linear binary code, i.e. s > 1. A general understanding of the condition under which s > 1 for those F 3 -linear codes for the Z-channel is still lacking.\nRecall that Example 6 starts from a single-error-correcting ternary cyclic code of length 3, and results in a 1-code of length 6 achieving the upper bound given in [8] via the map S 3 . Note that by the ternary construction, ternary cyclic codes give binary quasi-cyclic codes. It turns out that we cand ﬁnd more good 1-codes from cyclic ternary codes of length m.\nFor m = 4, we have found a ternary cyclic code with codewords 0000 , 0112 , 1222 , 1111 , and their cyclic shifts, which leads to a 1-code with parameters (8, 29). For m = 5, we have found a unique ternary cyclic code which lead to a 1-code with parameters (10, 98). For m = 6 and m = 7, we have found ternary cyclic codes which lead to 1-codes with parameters (12, 336) and (14, 1200), respectively.\nFrom Table II below we see that the 1-codes from cyclic ternary codes are not as good as the codes (8, 32) (given in Example 6) and (10, 105), (12, 351) which are obtained via random numerical search based on the ternary construction. However, with growing length imposing the cyclic structure reduces the search complexity. The code (14, 1200) listed in Table II, for example, is obtained from a ternary cyclic code of length m = 7, while random numerical search did not give anything better as the search space is too large.\nWe ﬁnally note that we use nonlinear cyclic codes. This makes it more complicated to ﬁnd a systematical generalized construction for larger length.\nIn this section we clarify the relationship between the ternary construction and the VT-CR codes, by showing that certain VT-CR codes are a special case of the ternary con- struction. We start from the following.\nDeﬁnition 11: A binary code C of even length n = 2m is called ternary if S m ( ˜ S m (C)) = C.\nBased on this deﬁnition, if a binary code C of even length is ternary, then it can be constructed from some ternary code via the map S. The following theorem shows that certain VT- CR codes are a special case of asymmetric codes constructed from some ternary codes.\nTheorem 12: For n even, the VT code V g and the CR code C g are ternary for any g.\nProof: Let C = V g or C = C g . We only need to prove that there exists a pairing of the coordinates of C such that for any codeword v ∈ C the following holds: if for a pair α of coordinates the code symbols of v are 00, denoted by v ∣ α = 00, then there exists another codeword v \u2032 ∈ C with v \u2032 ∣ α = 11 and v \u2032 ∣ ¯ α = v∣ ¯ α . Here ¯ α denotes all coordinates except the pair α.\nBoth the VT code V h and the CR code C g are deﬁned by a group G of odd order n + 1, and the coordinates of the codewords correspond to the non-identity group elements. As the group order is odd, the only group element that is its own inverse is identity. Hence we can pair every non-identity element g ∈ G with its inverse −g. If neither g nor −g are contained in the sum in Eq. (1), then the sum clearly does not change when including both g and −g.\nThe images of the VT code V 0 for n = 6 and the CR code C 0 of largest cardinality for n = 8 under ˜ S n are linear codes [3, 1, 3] 3 and [4, 2, 3] 3 , respectively (for the latter see Example 6). For n = 10, the image of the VT code V 0 = (10, 94) under ˜ S 10 is equivalent to a cyclic ternary code with m = 5, but note that there exists a 1-code (10, 98) which is obtained from a cyclic ternary code (see Sec. III).\nDeﬁnition 13: A binary code C of odd length n = 2m + 1 is called generalized ternary if S m ( ˜ S m (C)) = C, where ˜ S m acts on the last 2m coordinates of C.\nBased on this deﬁnition, if a binary code C of odd length 2m + 1 is generalized ternary, then it can be constructed from some single-error-correcting code for the channel Z × T m via the map ˜ S.\nTheorem 14: For n odd, the VT code V g is generalized ternary for any g.\nProof: We only need to prove that there exists a pairing which leaves a single coordinate as a bit, such that for any codeword v ∈ V g , if v restricted to a chosen pair α is 00, then there exist another codeword v \u2032 ∈ V g such that v \u2032 ∣ α = 11 and\nFor a VT code V g of odd length, choose the pairing {i, n + 1 − i} n /2 i =1 and leave the coordinate (n + 1)/2 as a bit. Then the above condition is satisﬁed.\nIn Table II, the cardinality of codes found by the (general- ized) ternary method is compared to the size of the correspond- ing VT-CR codes. One can see that the (generalized) ternary construction indeed outperforms the VT-CR construction, in particular for larger n.\nThe column in Table II labeled \u201cpartition\u201d is obtained from the partition method in Ref. [11]. The code (a) is found from the partition of constant weight codes of length 6 and\nasymmetric codes of length 4. Codes (b) and codes (c) are from Ref. [11] and [13], respectively. For n = 10, 11, 12, the ternary construction yields codes of equal size or even more codewords compared to the partition method. However, the best codes are obtained by heuristic methods, which, e.g., give (10, 112) [13] and (12, 379) [14]. This is not surprising as both the ternary construction and the partition method assume some additional structure of the binary 1-codes.\nIn this section, we consider the construction of 1-codes for nonbinary asymmetric channels. Recall that the characteristic properties of codes for this channel model are given by Deﬁnition 1 and Theorem 2. Our construction will again be based on concatenation, generalizing the map S m .\nFor a given q, choose the outer code as some code over the alphabet A = {0, 1, . . . , q − 1}, which encodes to some inner codes {C 0 , C 1 , . . . , C q −1 } via i ↦ C i . Now choose the q inner codes as the double-repetition code C 0 = {00, 11, . . . , (q − 1 )(q − 1)} and all its q − 1 cosets C i = C 0 + (0i), i.e., we have the rule that (0i) ∈ C i . It is straightforward to check that each C i is a 1-code, i.e., has asymmetric distance 2. Note that a single asymmetric error will only drive transitions between i, j for i = j ± 1. For instance, for q = 3, 4, 5, the induced channels R 3 , R 4 , R 5 are shown in Fig. 2. In general, we will write the induced channel as R q for outer codes over the alphabet A = {0, 1, . . . , q − 1}.\n-  - \nTheorem 15: For n even, an outer (n/2, K) q code correct- ing a single error for the channel R q leads to an (n, q n /2 K ) q 1-code C, for q > 2. For n odd, an outer ((n + 1)/2, K) q code correcting a single error for the channel R q leads to an (n, q (n−1)/2 K ) q 1-code C, for q > 2.\nIf the outer code is linear, then our construction gives linear codes for the asymmetric channel.\nCorollary 16: An outer [m, k] q linear code correcting a single error for the channel R q leads to a [2m, m + k] q 1- code and a [2m − 1, m + k − 1] q 1-code, for q > 2.\nIt turns out that in many cases, our construction gives linear codes with larger cardinality than the distance-three symmetric codes of equal length. We ﬁrst discuss the case of q = 3. In this case, R 3 is the ternary symmetric channel, so we will just use outer codes of Hamming distance 3. We consider some examples.\nExample 17: Consider q = 3 and take the outer code as [3, 1, 3] 3 , with codewords 000 , 111 , 222 . This will give a [5, 3] 3 1-code, while the best linear single-symmetric-error- correcting code is [5, 2, 3] 3 . The [3, 1, 3] 3 outer code also yields a [6, 4] 3 1-code, while the best linear single-symmetric- error-correcting code is [6, 3, 3] 3 .\nNow take the outer code as [4, 2, 3] 3 . This will give a [7, 5] 3 1-code, while the best linear single-symmetric-error- correcting code is [7, 4, 3] 3 . We can also construct a [8, 6] 3 1-code, while the best linear single-symmetric-error-correcting code is [8, 5, 3] 3 .\nThis example can be directly generalized to other lengths. Furthermore, the constructions extend trivially to q > 3, as any code of Hamming distance 3 corrects a single error for the channel R q . Note that Hamming codes over F q have length n r = (q r − 1)/(q − 1). For a given n r , our construction then allows to construct asymmetric 1-codes of all length [n r + 1, 2n r ] for n r odd or all lengths [n r + 2, 2n r ] for n r even. These codes outperform the best linear single-symmetric-error- correcting codes.\nNow consider the case q > 3 in more detail. The channel R q (see Fig. 2) is no longer a symmetric channel, so outer codes of Hamming distance 3 are no longer expected to give good 1-codes. It turns out, however, that single-error- correcting codes for the channel R q are equivalent to single- symmetric-error correcting codes with respect to Lee metric [17] (see also [18]), for which optimal linear codes are known. We consider an example.\nwhich gives a [10, 8] 5 code correcting a single error for the channel R 5 , and hence a [20, 18] 5 1-code. Note that the best linear single-symmetric-error-correcting code for n = 20 is [20, 17, 3] 5 .\nOur new linear codes for asymmetric channels for q > 2 show that Varshamov\u2019s argument that for the binary case, there is almost no hope to ﬁnd good linear codes for the asymmetric channel, does not hold for the nonbinary case. There is indeed room for constructing good linear codes adapted to the asymmetric channel.\nNote that contrary to the binary case, the nonlinear VT- CR codes can no longer be viewed as a special case of our construction. However, for lengths n r = q r −1, our construction\ngives codes of the same cardinality as the VT-CR codes, while our codes are linear, but the VT-CR codes are not.\nFinally, we brieﬂy discuss the extension of our concatena- tion method to construct t-asymmetric-error-correcting codes for t > 1. We look at some examples.\nExample 19: Consider the case of q = 3. Take the outer code as the [5, 3] 3 1-code constructed in Example 17, which has asymmetric distance 2. Now take the encoding to the inner code as 0 ↦ 00 , 1 ↦ 11 , 2 ↦ 22 . Then the concatenated code has asymmetric distance 4, which gives a [10, 3] 3 3-code, while the best linear triple-error-correcting code is [10, 2, 7] 3 . Similarly, take the outer code as the [6, 4] 3 1-code, then the concatenated code is a [12, 4] 3 3-code, while the best 3-error- correcting linear code is [12, 3, 7] 3 .\nThese initial results on good linear t-codes with t > 1 and q > 2 are rather promising as they might ﬁnd application in the context of ﬂash memories."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
