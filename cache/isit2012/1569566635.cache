RACS relies on integrating sensing with the commu- nication architecture, in order to achieve overall efﬁciency in terms of the energy per bit of information successfully delivered to the fusion center. Targeting realistic deployment conditions, we consider data gathering over a Ricean fading channel and in the presence of communication noise. We provide a framework for system design and study the energy and bandwidth requirements of the network. We then show that compared to a conventional TDMA network with ARQ, RACS achieves signiﬁcant energy and bandwidth savings. For example, for a network of 4000 nodes, we observe 10 dB gain in the energy as well as a 2.5-fold reduction in the required bandwidth."},"body":{"text":"Long-term monitoring of the natural environment is facil- itated by the advances in the wireless sensor technology [1], which enable the deployment of a large number of inexpensive sensors. The data from distributed sensors is conveyed to a fusion center (FC) where a full map of the sensing ﬁeld is reconstructed. This task is exacerbated in harsh environments that demand that the power be saved to prolong network life-time, bandwidth is constrained, and the communication channel introduces distortion. An efﬁcient scheme thus calls for the integration between sensing, communication, and ﬁeld recovery. In [2], [3] we proposed Random Access Compressed Sensing (RACS) which achieves overall efﬁciency in terms of the energy per bit of information successfully delivered. Considering the fact that most natural phenomena have a sparse representation in an appropriate domain, RACS capital- izes on integrating compressed sensing with random channel access. The former supports transmission of sensor data from only a random subset of all the nodes\u2013 thus reducing the overall energy consumption\u2013 while the latter supports a simple implementation that eliminates the need for synchronized scheduling. In the present paper, we address the design and performance of RACS under realistic deployment conditions, including fading and noisy communication channels.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we overview the principles of RACS. In Section III, we address the impact of channel fading and communication noise on the system performance. Section IV outlines the\ndesign methodology. In Section V, we study the bandwidth and energy utilization of the network. Finally, we provide concluding remarks in Section VI.\nThe theory of compressed sensing [4], [5] establishes that if a signal of dimension N has an S-sparse representation in an appropriate domain Ψ (referred to as the sparsity basis), it can be recovered, with very high probability, from O(µS log N) random measurements obtained in a sensing domain Φ. 1 Many natural signals have a compressible (sparse) representation in the frequency domain. Noting that the spatial coordinate basis and the spatial frequency basis are maximally incoherent, 2 the conditions for compressed sensing hold.\nRACS thus works as follows: The sensor node i, where i ∈ {1, . . ., N}, measures the signal of interest at random time instants (e.g., following a Poisson packet generation model), independently of the other nodes, at a rate of λ 1 measurements per second. It then encodes each measurement along with the node\u2019s location tag into a packet of L bits, which is transmitted to the FC over a fading and noisy random access channel. Combining random sensing with random channel access provides a simple scheme that is easy to implement and does not require synchronized scheduling. At the FC, a packet is declared erroneous if it does not pass the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) or a similar veriﬁcation procedure. Motivated by compressed sensing, the FC discards the erroneous packets, since it does not care which speciﬁc sensors are selected as long as (i) the selected subset is chosen uniformly at random, and (ii) there are sufﬁciently many correct packets collected to allow for the reconstruction of the ﬁeld. The FC collects the successfully received packets over an observation interval T , where T is assumed to be shorter than the coherence time of the process, such that the process can be approximated as ﬁxed during the observation interval. Among the successfully\nreceived packets, there may be more than one packet corre- sponding to a single node. Considering that the sensing ﬁeld has not changed, the extra packets, if successfully received, are redundant. Thus some of the received packets at the FC may be repetitive, while some are corrupted due to the communication noise and interference. To reconstruct the map of the ﬁeld, the FC recovers the sparse vector v which represents the Fourier transform of the ﬁeld, by solving\nmin v v 1 subject to RΨv = y. \t (2) where, y is the vector containing the useful packets, Ψ is the inverse discrete Fourier transform matrix and R models the selection of the useful packets, i.e., it consists of a uniformly random subset of the rows of the identity matrix corresponding to the useful packet collected. For more details on RACS the reader can refer to [2], [3].\nWe consider a random access network consisting of a total of N sensor nodes, where each node generates packets with an average rate of λ 1 packets/sec, and transmits the generated packet immediately to the FC. The wireless channel gain c i , observed by the i-th packet, can be modeled as\nwhere the effects of distance-dependent path loss and the shadowing are included in a gain G i , and small-scale fading is modeled by a complex-valued coefﬁcient h i ∼ CN (¯h, 1). Assuming that the data collection interval T is short compared to the de-correlation interval of the shadowing, the shadowing coefﬁcient is considered ﬁxed and can be estimated using an occasional downlink feedback. Thus we assume that G i can be pre-compensated at the transmitter by means of a power control mechanism, i.e., that the transmitter adjusts its power to P 0 /G 2 i , where P 0 is the desired average received power. We assume a quasi-static fading model, in which the fading coefﬁcients h i remain ﬁxed for the duration of a packet and change independently from one packet to the next. This assumption implies that the packets generated by a single node are distanced sufﬁciently apart in time such that they undergo independent fades. Also, the spatial correlation among the channels is assumed to be negligible.\nwhere u 0 (t) is the desired signal, i n (t) is the interference and w(t) is the additive white Gaussian noise with power N 0 B, where B is the bandwidth. The interfering term can be expressed as\nwhere u i (t) is the i-th interferer\u2019s signal, τ i is the difference in the arrival time of the interfering signal, with respect to the\nsignal of interest, and the number of interfering packets n, is a random variable with probability distribution P (n). Assuming that packet arrivals follow a Poisson distribution, we have that\nwhere T p = L/B is the packet duration. 3 For a given node, X 0 = |h 0 | 2 P 0 represents the power of the desired packet, and I n represents the total interference power. We assume that X 0 and I n follow probability distributions f X and f I , respectively. The instantaneous signal to interference and noise ratio is given by\nIn the worst case scenario, the packet arrivals are synchro- nized, i.e., τ i = 0 for i ∈ {1, . . . , N}. Thus the interfering power is denoted by I n = n i=1 |h i | 2 P 0 = Y n , and follows a probability distribution f Y . This, however, represents a pes- simistic scenario, since in RACS packet transmissions are not synchronized. Rather than considering various scenarios for the overlapping of packets, we employ a simpliﬁed model in which we assume that the strongest interferer dominates i n (t), i.e., we assume that the interference power is I n = |h m | 2 P 0 , where h m = max i∈{1,...,n} h i . Assuming M n = |h m | 2 P 0 has a probability distribution f M , it can be shown that\nf M (z) = nF X (z) n−1 f X (z) \t (8) where F X (x) is the CDF of X 0 .\nM n = max i |h i | 2 P 0 (model b) \t (9) Model (a) assumes the worst case scenario, thus leads to an overestimation of the effect of interference and yields slightly pessimistic results for the probability of successful reception. Model (b), on the other hand, underestimates the effect of the interference, resulting in a probability of success that is slightly larger than the one predicted using model (a). The models (a) and (b) given by (9) thus provide upper and lower bounds, respectively, on the actual interfering power.\nFor a given number of interfering packets n, the probability of successful reception p s|n (γ) is an increasing function of γ, where the shape of the function depends on system parameters such as modulation, coding, etc. The following two models can be used to describe p s|n (γ):\n1) Outage Model: In this model, p s|n (γ) is described by a step function as\nThe effects of coding, modulation and other system pa- rameters are implicit in b, which is a predeﬁned threshold with a typical value b = 2 − 6 [6], [7].\nwe use the bit error probability p d (γ) to determine the probability of receiving a correct packet as\nHere p d (γ) depends on the modulation scheme used, for instance p d (γ) = Q(\nUsing powerful long codes, Eq. (11) approaches a step func- tion, thus p s|n (γ) in the BER model approaches that in the outage model [11].\nAssuming the outage model, averaging p s|n (γ) over the fading statistics results in\nf X (γw)f I (w − N 0 B)wdwdγ for n ≥ 1 (12)\n(1 − p d (γ)) L f X (x)f I (y)dxdy for n ≥ 1 (13)\nThe total probability of successful reception is then given by\nAs a general model for a wireless communication channel, we assume that the amplitudes of the channel gains |h i | follow i.i.d Ricean distribution where the rice factor K is deﬁned as the ratio of the power in the line of sight (LOS) component to the power in the scattered component. In the special case when there is no LOS component present, i.e., K = 0, the envelope of h i follows a Rayleigh distribution. In this case, X 0 follows an exponential distribution given by\nFor the interference model (a), Y n follows a gamma distribu- tion\nIn the outage model, the probability of successful reception in model (a) is found in closed form as\nNote that in a noise-less fading channel, the probability of successful reception reduces to p s = e −2Nλ 1 T p b 1+ b as derived in [12].\nWe start by examining the impact of the choice of the threshold b in the outage model given by (10). The proper choice of b depends on the modulation and coding techniques used. Fig. 1 depicts the probability of successful reception using both the BER and the outage models for various scenarios. We observe that for a non-coded scheme we can adopt a threshold value b = 6, while the outage model with b = 2 corresponds to employing a code with a large coding gain, and ﬁnally b = 4 lies in between. For the rest of this paper, we employ the outage model with a threshold b = 4.\nFig. 2 shows the probability of successful reception in Rayleigh fading ( K = 0) using the two models (a) and (b) for interference given by Eq. (9). As expected, model (b) predicts a larger p s than model (a). We note that for our choice of system parameters, the bounds on p s , provided by models (a) and (b), are tight, and the gap further diminishes as bandwidth is increased. Thus the actual p s is approximated relatively accurately by each model. Throughout the rest of the paper we use model (a) and design the system for the worst case scenario, keeping in mind that the actual system performance will be slightly better than assumed by this model.\nFig. 3 shows p s in a Ricean fading channel for K = 3 and K = 6 dB. We observe from the ﬁgure that in the noise-limited scenario ( γ 0 very small) and in the interference- limited scenario ( γ 0 very large) channel fading boosts the probability of successful reception. The reason is that when fading is present, not every collision has to result in packet loss. Namely, it is possible that although two (or more) packets overlap at the FC, one is sufﬁciently stronger so that it can be successfully detected.\nThe total number of packets that are used in the reconstruc- tion process, referred to as the useful packets and denoted by\nK(λ 1 , T ), is the number of received packets left after dis- carding the erroneous and repetitive packets. The probability of receiving a useful packet from a node can be expressed as [12]\nThe arrival of useful packets follows a Poisson process with an effective average arrival rate\nwhere p s is the probability of successful reception for a given node, determined in Section III.\nWe deﬁne the probability of sufﬁcient sensing as the proba- bility that the FC collects N s or more useful packets during T , where N s = CS log N is speciﬁed by compressed sensing (C is a constant). We then specify the performance requirement as the minimum probability of sufﬁcient sensing, P s . Thus, the design criterion is expressed as\nProb {K(λ 1 , T ) ≥ N s } ≥ P s \t (21) The condition (21) can equivalently be stated as\npackets collected in T . The design objective is to determine the minimum per-node sensing rate λ 1s that is necessary to ensure sufﬁcient sensing. In a Rayleigh fading channel, using Eq. (18) for p s , the minimum per-node sensing rate λ 1s can be expressed as\nwhere W 0 ( ·) denotes the principal branch of the Lambert W function and β = b b+1 . In a Ricean fading channel, λ 1s can be determined numerically for a given α s . In Fig 4(a), for a given N s and a desired P s , the corresponding α s is determined. Then, for the obtained value of α s , Fig. 4(b) shows the minimum per-node sensing rate λ 1s for Rayleigh and Ricean fading channels.\nThe minimum bandwidth B s required to achieve a certain performance over a Rayleigh fading channel, is obtained as\n(Note that the minimum bandwidth over a Ricean fading chan- nel can be determined numerically.) Let P T = P 0 E {G −2 i } denote the average per-node transmission power, where in order to maintain a ﬁxed received SNR γ 0 it must be that P 0 = N 0 Bγ 0 . The total average energy required for one ﬁeld reconstruction is thus given by\nwhere η = E {G −2 i }. We note that the energy expenditure E min depends on the transmission bandwidth B through λ 1s , where λ 1s (B) is largest when B = B s , and decreases with B. Thus we determine lower and upper bounds on the energy consumption as\ns /N E up = E min (B s ) = N N 0 γ 0 ηL · e 1+b/γ 0 · log \t 1 1 − α\ns /N where the bounds are within a constant gap of size e.\nTo further demonstrate the advantage of RACS, we compare the energy and bandwidth requirements of RACS with those of a conventional (benchmark) design. The benchmark scheme is a TDMA network in which all N nodes transmit using pre-assigned time slots. In the presence of noise and fading, some of the packets are not successfully received. A common approach to deal with the packet loss is to employ an automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme, by which the receiver requests retransmission of a failed packet. The average number of retransmissions required to ensure a packet is successfully received is 1 1−p f , where p f denotes the probability of failure for a packet and is given by\nin Rayleigh fading. The bandwidth and energy requirements of the benchmark TDMA network using ARQ are\nThe saving in energy achieved by RACS, over a benchmark network using ARQ, is given by\nFig. 5 shows the savings achieved by RACS over the bench- mark network. We notice that considerable gain in energy\u2013 on the order of 20 dB\u2013 is achievable. Also, we observe a reduction in the required bandwidth, e.g., a 20 fold decrease in the required bandwidth for a network of size N = 4 × 10 4 .\nRandom access compressed sensing (RACS) is an energy- efﬁcient approach to data gathering over large-scale sensor networks. By combining random sensing with a simple random access, RACS eliminates the need for synchronized scheduling (as is required for deterministic channel access methods such as TDMA), thus making it easy to implement over a large network. To address realistic deployments for RACS, we took into consideration the impact of channel fading and noise on the design and performance of the network. It was shown that in the noise-limited and the interference-limited scenarios, fading boosts the probability of successful reception. We assessed the performance of RACS analytically in terms of the energy and bandwidth utilization. We observe signiﬁcant gains in energy and bandwidth over a TDMA network using ARQ. For example, for a network of 4000 nodes, we achieve 10 dB saving in energy as well as lower bandwidth requirements.\nThis work is funded in part by ONR grant N00014-09-1- 0700, NSF grant 0831728, and NSF CAREER grant ECCS-"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"J.
