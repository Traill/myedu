Unfortunately, se- quence sets with both ideal zero out-of-phase auto correlation and all-zero cross-correlation do not exist [10]. While these ideal sets are unattainable, it is possible to identify sequence sets that are almost as good as ideal sets. These sets include: (1) the sets of ideal auto correlation sequences with minimum constant cross-correlation, and (2) the sets of sequences with both auto and cross-correlation assuming a zero value for delays contained in an interval called the zero correlation zone (ZCZ). The former sets, which we considered previously in [1]-[4], are called the perfect sequence sets. The latter sets, which we focus on here, are usually referred to either as the partial correlation or the ZCZ sequence sets.\nPrior work on ZCZ sequence set design includes, among others, [8], [9], [11], [12], [13], [14], and [15]. One of the main results in this area is the demonstration that there are limits on the size of the ZCZ and on the size of the ZCZ set. In particular, it was shown that for a set of M N -point polyphase sequences, the length of the ZCZ is less than N/M [11]. The ZCZ in most works is considered jointly, that is presuming the same constraint applies to both auto and cross-correlation, however, as we demonstrate here, this is not always necessary.\nIn this work we consider the design of ZCZ sequence sets in Zak space. While several Zak space constructions of ZCZ sequence sets are available (a comprehensive review of these constructions will be given elsewhere), we focus here on a\ncertain special construction that is associated with a variable size ZCZ auto correlation and an all-zero cross-correlation, and is obtained by an analysis of polyphase sequences on an M 2 × M Zak transform lattice. We call this construction the construction A. The construction includes the sequence sets with (M − 1)-point, (T 2 M − 1)-point and (M 2 − 1)-point zero auto correlation zone, where T 2 is an arbitrary non-trivial factor of M . All sequences in these sets have discrete Fourier transforms with constant non-zero magnitude at M 2 points and zero magnitude at (M − 1)M 2 points, and ﬁnite Zak transforms with constant non-zero magnitude at M points and zero magnitude at M 3 −M points. The compact support of the ﬁnite Zak transforms is particularly convenient, as due to the special structure of the Zak space cross-correlation, the support of individual sequences in the set can be identiﬁed with a subset of rows of the Zak transform. This correspondance facilitates, among others, sequence storage and correlation computation.\nApart from relevance to applications, the all-zero cross- correlation ZCZ set is of theoretical interest, as it is in a certain sense the dual of the perfect sequence set, the set of sequences with ideal auto correlation. If an exact dual set to the perfect sequence set, i.e., a polyphase set with all-zero cross-correlation, a constant out-of-phase auto correlation, and of dimension equal to the perfect set, exists, remains an open problem.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief introduction to Zak space methods. Sections 3 and 4 describe the construction A. Section 5 contains a comparison of the construction A with the Torii-Nakamura- Suehiro construction.\nTake x to be any N -periodic sequence in C N and set e L (j) := e 2πij/L . Suppose N = LM , where L and M are positive integers. Then the ﬁnite Zak transform (FZT) of x is given by the formula [16]\nWe will state, without proofs, only a few basic properties of the FZT. For a more extensive review of Zak transform theory and a historical background, the reader is referred to [6].\nLike the DFT, the FZT is a one-to-one mapping. A signal x can be recovered from its FZT by the formula\nTake 0 ≤ j < L and 0 ≤ k < M for the remainder of this paper, unless indicated otherwise. The FZT is periodic in the frequency variable and quasi-periodic in the time variable, i.e.,\nA related property describes the FZT of time and frequency shifts of x. Set y(n) = x(n − c) and z(n) = x(n)e N (dn), where 0 ≤ c < M and 0 ≤ d < L. Then the FZTs of y and z are given by\nConsider the cyclic cross-correlation of two N -periodic polyphase sequences, x and y, given by\n(7) where m−n is taken modulo N . When y = x, the cyclic cross- correlation is called the cyclic auto correlation. Take X L , Y L and Z L to be the FZTs of x, y and z in (7), respectively. Then\nThe result of this operation can be viewed as an assembly of L M -point time domain cross-correlations performed on frequency slices of the L × M Zak space (ZS) signals, X L and Y L .\nConsider an L × M FZT, X L , satisfying the following condition:\nL = M 2 and |X L (j, k)| = L at exactly M points, one at each column and in M distinct rows, and |X L (j, k)| = 0 otherwise.\nWe will call a sequence x having an FZT satisfying the condition A, a construction A.\nFix by S X := {j 0 , ..., j M−1 } ⊂ (0, 1, ..., L − 1), the set of indices of rows of X L , ordered in k, containing the non-zero values of X L . We will call S X the j-support of X L .\nX L (j 0 , 0)e L (−j 0 ), X L (j 1 , 1)e L (−j 1 ), ..., X L (j M−1 , M − 1)e L (−j M−1 ),\n(9) is a polyphase sequence.\nthe support of the DFT of x is determined by the j- support of X L , i.e.,\n3) By the ZS cross-correlation formula, any two sequences x and y, with FZTs X L and Y L satisfying the condition A and having disjoined j-supports, i.e., S X ∩S Y = {∅}, have all-zero cross-correlation, i.e.,\nSince, by condition A, L = M 2 , then (0, 1, ..., L − 1) can be partitioned into M disjoint M -point sets, S (0) X ∪ ... ∪ S (M−1) X , which permits the construction of a set of M orthogonal FZTs X (0) L , X (1) L ... X (M−1) L \t , and hence the construction of a set of M polyphase sequences with all-zero cross-correlation.\n4) Since there are L M ways to choose M rows of X L , M ! ways to specify non-zero entries in M rows and L phase choices for each non-zero value, there are\nM !L M /M distinct sets of M sequences with all-zero cross-correlation.\nWe will consider the auto correlation properties of construction A seperately, in the next section.\nSuppose x is an N -periodic sequence in C N and z is its cyclic auto correlation. Deﬁne the zero auto correlation zone (ZACZ) of x as the set of consecutive integers {1, 2, ..., k}, such that for all 1 ≤ k \u2032 ≤ k, z(k \u2032 ) = 0 and z(k + 1) = 0. We call |ZACZ| := k the length of the ZACZ of x. We will show next that\nApplication of condition A to (8) constrains the non-zero entries in the FZT of the auto correlation sequence, Z L (j, k), to k = 0, 0 ≤ j < L, which, in turn, constrains the non-zero entries in the auto correlation sequence, z(k + rM ), to k = 0, 0 ≤ r < L, i.e.,\n0, \t else. \t (15) In effect, to verify the validy of (14), one only needs to assess z(rM ) for 0 ≤ r ≤ M . We will consider two cases: when M is a prime, and when M is not a prime.\ne L (−j) = 0, else, \t (16) where\nSince, for S X = S 1 , z (rM ) = 1 M\nand therefore |ZACZ| = T 2 M − 1. In particular, when T 2 = M then |ZACZ| = L − 1. When S X is not as in (21) then |ZACZ| = M − 1. In effect,\nIn general, |ZACZ| + 1 is either M , an appropriate multiple of M or L, the last case occurring when S X = S 1 with the restriction of M to prime values lifted.\nConsider a case when M is not a prime. Fix M = 4, L = M 2 = 16, N = M 3 = 64, T 1 = T 2 = 2 and\nS (0) X = (8, 1, 0, 9). From the set of FZTs satisfying these constraints, choose the FZT\n  \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  \n                          \n−1 e L (−1) 1 e L (−9) 1 e L (−2) 1 e L (−2)\n−1 e L (−3) 1 e L (−11) 1 \t −i \t 1 \t −i\n−1 e L (−5) 1 e L (−13) 1 e L (−6) 1 e L (−6)\n−1 e L (−7) 1 e L (−15) 1 \t −1 \t 1 \t −1\n−1 e L (−9) 1 e L (−1) 1 e L (−10) 1 e L (−10)\n−1 e L (−11) 1 e L (−3) 1 \t i \t 1 \t i\n−1 e L (−13) 1 e L (−5) 1 e L (−14) 1 e L (−14)\n                          \ne L (−rj), k = 0, 0, \t else,\n= 1 4 (4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2 + 2e L (−2), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2 + 2e L (−4), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2 + 2e L (−6), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2 + 2e L (−10), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2 + 2e L (−12), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\nComputation of the remaining three sequences in the ZCZ set, associated with the FZTs with j-supports S (1) X , S (2) X and S (3) X , proceeds similarly.\nIn [13], a new construction of ZCZ sequence set was intro- duced by Torii, Nakamura and Suehiro (TNS), based on per- fect sequences and unitary matrices. Here, we brieﬂy compare the main features of the TNS construction and the construction A (Table 1). This comparison is appropriate, in that both TNS sequences and construction A are closely related to chirp-like sequences, or bat chirps [3], and in that the two constructions have suitably matching dimensions.\nThe TNS construction utilizes smaller number of phases than construction A, which is desirable in some navigation and communications applications but might be a disadvantage in radar and cryptography. The main advantage of the TNS construction is that its |ZACZ| reaches the theoretical upper\nbound, L − 1, while the |ZACZ| of construction A reaches only half that value. On the other hand, the construction A is advantageous in that its cross-correlation is all-zero, the DFT of x has a highly structured support and the FZT of x is sparse."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
