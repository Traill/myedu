Proto- graph LDPC codes are constructed by lifting a smaller Tanner graph, called the base graph. The resultant graph after lifting is called a lifted graph. In the case of using circulant permutations in the lifting process, the resultant code is called quasi cyclic (QC). QC protograph codes are attractive for their simple implementation. A special case of protograph construction, is the case where the base graph is a fully connected bipartite graph. We refer to the protograph codes constructed by applying circulant permutations to the edges of such a base graph as conventional QC LDPC codes. Clearly, these codes are regular. Two examples of conventional QC LDPC codes are Tanner- Sridhara-Fuja (TSF) codes [17] and array-based LDPC codes [5].\nThe girth of the Tanner graph of an LDPC code has long been identiﬁed as an important parameter to measure the iterative decoding performance of the code [13]. Finding QC LDPC codes with large girth has been the subject of several works, for example, [12], [16], [6], [14], [18], [20], [4], [19], [3]. Fossorier [6] studied the cycle structure of conventional QC LDPC codes and presented some bounds on the lifting degree for having a certain girth. He also showed that the girth of such codes is upper bounded by 12. Myung et al. [15] also studied the cycle properties of QC LDPC codes by deﬁning block cycles and considering the overlaps between such cycles. They used this concept to obtain an upper bound on the girth of QC protograph LDPC codes, and rederived the upper bound of 12 on the girth of conventional QC LDPC codes.\nKim et al. [12] extended the concept of block cycles by deﬁning inevitable cycles and found all the inevitable cycles of length up to 20. They also proposed a QC LDPC code construc- tion that avoided all the inevitable cycles of length up to 12, resulting in LDPC codes with girth larger than 12. However their construction relies on using very large lifting degrees of N = 37 5 and N = 4 15 , which are not suitable in practice.\nIn [9] and [10], the work of [12] was extended by deﬁning abelian-inevitable cycles , and a new proof was provided for the upper bound of 12 on the girth of conventional QC LDPC codes. In [11], the girth of conventional QC LDPC codes for the special case that the base graph is a (fully-connected) 3 × 5 graph and the lifting degree is a prime number of the form 15m+1 was studied.\nIn the literature listed above, except [6] and [11], only the structure of the subgraphs of the base graph whose inverse image is inevitably a cycle in the lifted graph was studied. Such subgraphs were generally studied in isolation. In addition, in the literature, a great deal has been devoted to ﬁnding LDPC codes with girths equal to or larger than 12. Such codes generally have very sparse graphs and very large block lengths (corresponding to very large lifting degrees and/or low rates). This is while, the girth of practical LDPC codes (of medium to high rate with short to medium block length) is usually less than 12.\nIn this paper, we study the relationship between the short cycles of a lifted graph, on one hand, and the size of the base graph and the lifting degree, on the other hand. For this, we closely examine the relationships among the subgraphs of the base graph whose inverse images in the lifted graph are short cycles. This is unlike the approach generally adopted in the existing literature [15], [12], [9], [10], where such subgraphs are studied in isolation. As a result of this study, we derive an upper bound on the girth of a QC protograph code. Unlike the other bounds which are only based on the inevitable cycles, the proposed upper bound is based on the dependency of the circular permutation shifts of short cycles in the base graph. Comparing with the available bounds on the girth of QC protograph codes, the proposed upper bound is tighter for many cases. As an example, we show that for the TSF (155, 64) code [17], which is constructed by lifting a 3 × 5 fully connected base graph with a lifting degree 31, the largest possible girth is 8, regardless of the permutations used. This is while the upper bound provided by the other works, including [6], for the girth of this code is 12. It should be mentioned that for the case of a fully connected base graph and a girth 6 or 8, our method generally results in the same bounds as those of [6]. However, there are two main differences between our work and that of [6]. First, the bounds in [6] are only for the protograph codes with a fully connected base graph. This is while our method can be easily used for a protograph code with a not-fully-connected regular or irregular base graph as well. In fact, the only condition we assume for the base graph is not to have any parallel edges. It is worth noting that this assumption covers all the protograph LDPC codes currently adopted in standards. Second, we provide bounds for the case where the girth of the lifted graph is equal to 10. This case is not\ncovered in [6]. Moreover, the general technique proposed here can be applied to girths even larger than 10. The derivations however become more tedious as larger girths are considered. The results presented in this paper can be used as part of the toolbox to design QC protograph LDPC codes. They can help in the selection of the base graph and its edge permutations, or in choosing the lifting degree.\nAn undirected Graph G = (V, E) is deﬁned as a set of nodes V and a set of edges E, where E is some subset of the pairs {{u, v} : u, v ∈ V, u = v}.The degree of a node v ∈ V is denoted by d v . A walk of length n in a graph G is a non-empty alternating sequence v 0 e 1 v 1 . . . v n−1 e n v n of nodes and edges in G such that e i = {v i−1 , v i } for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If the two end nodes are the same, i.e., if v 0 = v n , the walk is closed. A closed walk is backtrackless if e i = e i+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. A backtrackless closed walk is called tailless if e n = e 1 . A closed walk with distinct intermediate nodes is called a cycle. The length of the shortest cycle(s) in the graph is called girth. Cycles of length k are also referred to as k-cycles. In the sequel, we may describe a walk only with its sequence of edges, or if there are no parallel edges in the graph, just with the sequence of its nodes.\nLemma 1 ([8]): In a graph G with girth g, every tailless backtrackless closed walk of length less than 2g is a cycle.\nA graph G(V, E) is called bipartite if the set V can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets U and W (V = U ∪ W and U ∩ W = ∅) such that every edge in E connects a node from U to a node from W . We denote |U | by n and |W | by m. Tanner graphs of LDPC codes are bipartite graphs, in which U and W are referred to as variable nodes and check nodes, respectively. This implies m < n, which is what we assume in the rest of the paper.\nConsider the cyclic subgroup C N of the symmetric group S N over the set of integer numbers Z N {0, ..., N − 1}, with the group operation deﬁned as composition. Consider the circulant permutation π p in C N which corresponds to p cyclic shifts to the right. We refer to p as the shift of the permutation π p .\nConsider the following construction of a graph ˜ G = ( ˜ V , ˜ E) from a graph G = (V, E): We ﬁrst make N copies of G such that for each node v ∈ V , we have N copies ˜ v \t {v 0 . . . , v N −1 } in ˜ V . For each edge e = {u, v} ∈ E, we apply a permutation π e ∈ C N to the N copies of e in ˜ E The set of these edges is denoted by ˜ e. The graph ˜ G is called a cyclic N-cover or a cyclic N-lifting of G, and G is referred to as the base graph corresponding to ˜ G.\nIn this work, G is a Tanner graph, and we deﬁne the edge permutations from the variable side to the check side, i.e., the set of edges ˜ e in ˜ E corresponding to an edge e = {b, c} ∈ E is deﬁned by {b i , c π e (i) }, i ∈ Z N . We denote the bi-adjacency matrix of G by H, and refer to it as the base matrix. The base matrix has m rows and n columns.\nTo the lifted graph ˜ G, we associate an LDPC code ˜ C, referred to as the lifted code, such that the mN × nN parity-check matrix ˜ H of ˜ C is equal to the bi-adjacency matrix of ˜ G. More speciﬁcally, ˜ H consists of a total of mn sub-matrices [ ˜ H] ij ,\n1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, with each sub-matrix of dimension N × N , arranged in m rows and n columns. The sub-matrix [ ˜ H] ij in row i and column j is the circulant permutation matrix corresponding to the edge {b j , c i } when h ij = 0 ; otherwise, [H] ij is the all-zero matrix. Following [1], we deﬁne the m × n matrix P = [p ij ] by [ ˜ H] ij = I (p ij ) , p ij ∈ Z N , where I (p ij ) is a circulant permutation matrix whose rows are obtained by cyclically shifting the rows of the identity matrix to the left by p ij , if h ij = 0 , and p ij = +∞, otherwise. Matrix P , called the matrix of edge permutation shifts, or permutation matrix in brief, fully describes ˜ H and thus the cyclically lifted code ˜ C.\nIt is known that the structures which map to cycles in a lifted graph are tailless backtrackless closed walks in the base graph [7], [2]. Consider a walk W of length l in G, with the sequence of edges e 1 , . . . , e l . Suppose that, corresponding to the edges, we have the sequence of permutation shifts p 1 , . . . , p l . The permutation shift of W is deﬁned as [1], [2]:\nThe following theorem gives the necessary and sufﬁcient condi- tions for a tailless backtrackless closed walk to map to cycle(s) in the lifted graph.\nTheorem 1 ([7], [2]): Let W be a tailless backtrackless closed walk of length l in G with the permutation shift Π. Then the image of W , is a set of l-cycles in the N -lifted graph ˜ G, if and only if Π is 0 and W does not contain any tailless backtrackless closed walk with the permutation shift of 0.\nAccording to Theorem 1, the permutation shift Π of a walk in the base graph, and consequently the permutation shift assign- ment to the edges of the walk, play a crucial rule in whether the walk is mapped to a cycle or not. However, there are situations where the permutation shift of a walk is zero, independent of the permutations assigned to the edges of the walk. This can happen when the number of traversals of each edge in one direction is the same as that in the opposite direction. In this case, the permutation shift of the walk is always zero. The structures with this property are called inevitable cycles [9]. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show two important classes of inevitable cycles, called the theta graph and the dumbbell graph, respectively [7].\nBy ﬁnding the inevitable cycles of the base graph, one can provide an upper bound on the girth of the lifted graph. This is the idea used in [9], [10], [12] and [15]. In this work, we use the dependencies among the permutation shifts of different backtrackless tailless closed walks of the base graph. We show that depending on the base graph and the lifting degree and regardless of the permutation values, the permutation shift of\nsome of the tailless backtrackless closed walks shorter than the inevitable cycles may necessarily be zero. This then dictates an upper bound on the girth of the lifted graph, which is tighter than the one imposed by inevitable cycles.\nIn this paper, we consider the base graphs with no parallel edges. This implies that the girth of the base graph is at least 4. Considering Lemma 1, it thus turns out that all the tailless backtrackless closed walks of length 4 and 6 in such base graphs are cycles.\nAccording to the above discussion, all the tailless backtrack- less closed walks of length 4, which may map to 4-cycles of the lifted graph, are 4-cycles in the base graph. To avoid 4-cycles in the lifted graph, one thus needs to assign the edge permutation shifts such that the permutation shifts of all the 4-cycles of the base graph will be non-zero. In the following, we study the dependencies between the permutation shifts of 4-cycles which have exactly 2 edges in common.\nFigure 2 shows three 4-cycles C 1 : u 1 , w 1 , u 2 , w 2 , u 1 , C 2 : u 1 , w 1 , u 2 , w 3 , u 1 , and C 3 : u 1 , w 3 , u 2 , w 2 , u 1 . Let Π 1 and Π 2 be the permutation shifts of cycles C 1 and C 2 , respectively. It is then easy to see that the permutation shift of C 3 is Π 3 = Π 1 - Π 2 . This means that if Π 1 = Π 2 , then Π 3 will be zero, and therefore it will map to a set of 4-cycles in the lifted graph. This implies that to have a lifted graph with a girth greater than 4, all the cycles of length 4 in the base graph which share exactly 2 edges must have different permutation shifts.\nAccording to the assumption of no parallel edges in the base graph, if two 4-cycles share exactly two edges, those edges must have one node in common. For example, the two shared edges between cycles C 1 and C 2 in Figure 2 have node w 1 in common. Consider any two rows i and j of a base matrix, and let α(r i , r j ) be the number of positions in which both rows have non-zero elements. It is easy to see that α(r i , r j ) − 1 is the number of 4-cycles involving check nodes corresponding to rows i and j, which share exactly two edges with one common variable node. Similarly for any two columns i and j, α(c i , c j ) − 1 is the number of 4-cycles involving variable nodes corresponding to columns i and j, which share exactly two edges with one common check node. Let α r,max = Max{α(r i , r j ) − 1}, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m, i = j, and α c,max = Max{α(c i , c j ) − 1}, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, i = j. Then the lifting degree N must be at least α max = Max{α r,max , α c,max } + 1 to allow all the 4-cycles sharing 2 edges with one common node to have different non- zero permutation shifts.\nLemma 2: For any QC protograph code constructed using a base graph with no parallel edges, the necessary condition for having a girth of at least 6, is to have the lifting degree N ≥ α max , where α max is the maximum number of common\nnon-zero positions between any two rows or any two columns of the base matrix.\nIt should be mentioned that since the size of the base graphs is usually small, it is computationally very easy to ﬁnd α max .\nFor the case where the base graph is an m×n fully connected graph, α(r i , r j ) = n, for all i = j, and α(c i , c j ) = m, for all i = j. Therefore, N must be at least α max = Max{m, n} = n.\nCorollary 1: In constructing a cyclically lifted graph with lifting degree N using an m × n fully connected base graph with no parallel edges, the necessary condition for having a girth of at least 6 for the lifted graph is N ≥ n.\nIt should be mentioned that this bound is tight for prime n. For example, consider the following matrix of permutation shifts:\n     \n0 \t 2 \t 4 \t . . . \t (2n - 4) N .. . .. . \t .. . \t . . . \t .. .\n     \nwhere (k) N denotes the value of k modulo N . If the fully connected base graph is lifted based on P and with the degree of lifting N , where N is the smallest prime number satisfying N ≥ n, then the lifted graph has a girth of (at least) 6. In the case that n itself is a prime number (and thus N = n), the lifted codes are called array based LDPC codes. Based on Corollary 1, for a prime n, array based LDPC codes are the smallest possible QC protograph codes, resulting from a fully connected base graph, with girth 6.\nFor a base graph with no parallel edges, all the tailless backtrackless closed walks of length 6 are cycles. That is, the only structure which may be mapped to a 6-cycle in the lifted graph is also a 6-cycle in the base graph. To avoid 6-cycles in the lifted graph, one thus needs to assign the edge permutation shifts such that the permutation shifts of all 6-cycles of the base graph will be non-zero.\nConsider the structure of Figure 3, where two 4-cycles share an edge e = (u 1 , w 1 ). In Figure 3, there are two 4-cycles\nC 1 : u 1 , w 1 , u 3 , w 3 , u 1 , C 2 : u 1 , w 1 , u 2 , w 2 , u 1 , and a 6- cycle C 3 : u 1 , w 2 , u 2 , w 1 , u 3 , w 3 , u 1 . Let Π 1 and Π 2 be the permutation shifts of cycles C 1 and C 2 , respectively. It is then easy to see that the permutation shift of C 3 is Π 3 = Π 1 - Π 2 . This means that if Π 1 = Π 2 , then Π 3 will be zero, and therefore C 3 will be mapped to a set of 6-cycles in the resultant lifted graph. This implies that to avoid cycles of length 6 in the lifted graph, all the cycles of length 4 in the base graph which share exactly one edge must have different permutation shifts. We are thus interested in counting such cycles. First, we consider the\nspecial case where the base matrix is an all-one matrix. For the given edge e = (u i 1 , w j 1 ), we consider all the 4-cycles containing e. All such cycles can be represented in the form of u i 1 , w j 1 , u i 2 , w j 2 , u i 1 , with different values for i 2 and j 2 . For an m × n fully connected base graph, i 2 can be any value between 1 and n, except i 1 (i.e., 1 ≤ i 2 ≤ n and i 2 = i 1 ). This means that there are n − 1 choices for i 2 . Similarly, 1 ≤ j 2 ≤ m and j 2 = j 1 , i.e., there are m − 1 possible choices for j 2 . This means that there are (n − 1)(m − 1) distinct 4-cycles which contain e. These cycles can share only one edge (edge e) or two edges (edge e and one other edge), but not three edges because there are no parallel edges in the graph. For the lifted graph to have a girth of at least 8, all such 4-cycles must have different non-zero permutation shifts. Satisfying this condition will also satisfy the condition discussed in Section III.A, implying that the lifted graph will not contain any 4-cycle or 6-cycle.\nLemma 3: For any QC protograph code constructed using an m × n fully-connected base graph with no parallel edges, the necessary condition for having a girth of at least 8, is that the lifting degree N ≥ (n − 1)(m − 1) + 1.\nExample 1: According to Lemma 3, in order to have a girth of at least 8 in a protograph construction using a fully connected 3 × 5 base graph, the lifting degree must be N ≥ 9. The following permutation matrix with a lifting degree N = 13 results in a lifted graph with girth 8.\n1 7 0 10 7 3 6 5 1 7 6 8 9 9 5\nFor an arbitrary regular or irregular base graph, the minimum lifting degree for having a girth of at least 8, can similarly be determined based on the maximum number of 4-cycles sharing a speciﬁc edge.\nLemma 4: For any QC protograph code constructed using a base graph with no parallel edges, the necessary condition for having a girth of at least 8, is that the lifting degree N > Max{N e i 4 }, where the maximum is taken over all the edges of the base graph, i.e., 1 ≤ i ≤ |E|, and N e i 4 is the number of 4-cycles containing the edge e i .\nIt should be mentioned that N e i 4 can be computed easily by subtracting the number of 4-cycles of the base graph after removing e i from the graph, from the total number of 4-cycles in the graph. Moreover, it is easy to see that for any edge e i = (u, w), N e i 4 ≤ (d u − 1)(d w − 1). This upper bound can be used to ﬁnd an approximation for the minimum value of N .\nFigure 4 shows all the possible tailless backtrackless closed walks of length 8 in a base graph with no parallel edges. Fig. 4(a) is a simple cycle of length 8. In Figures 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), the walks consist of two 4-cycles which share one node, two nodes (one edge) and three nodes (two edges), respectively. One of the possible walks for the case of Figure 4(c) is speciﬁed using the arrows in the ﬁgure. In Figure 4(e), the walks go through the 4-cycle twice.\nWe ﬁrst consider the case of Figure 4(b). Starting from node w 1 , one possible tailless backtrackless closed walk is W 1 : w 1 , u 1 , w 2 , u 2 , w 1 , u 3 , w 3 , u 4 , w 1 and the other one is\nW 2 : w 1 , u 1 , w 2 , u 2 , w 1 , u 4 , w 3 , u 3 , w 1 . Let the permutation shifts of the 4-cycles w 1 , u 1 , w 2 , u 2 , w 1 and w 1 , u 4 , w 3 , u 3 , w 1 be Π 1 and Π 2 , respectively (see Figure 4(b)). The permutation shift Π W 1 of walk W 1 is then Π W 1 = Π 1 - Π 2 , and the permutation shift Π W 2 of walk W 2 is Π W 2 = Π 1 + Π 2 . In order to have a girth greater than 8, the permutation shift of such walks must be non-zero. That is the permutation assignment of the edges must be such that Π 1 = Π 2 and Π 1 = (−Π 2 ) N . In other words, the permutation shifts of all the 4-cycles sharing one speciﬁc node must be different from each other and be different from the additive inverse of each other.\nA similar investigation of Figures 4(c) and 4(d) reveals that to avoid the 8-cycles in the lifted graph caused by the tailless backtrackless closed walks in these ﬁgures, the permutation shifts of all the 4-cycles that share two nodes (one edge) or three nodes (two edges) must be different from each other and be different from the additive inverse of each other.\nFor the case of Figure 4(e), one possible tailless backtrackless closed walk of length 8 is W 3 : w 1 , u 1 , w 2 , u 2 , w 1 , u 1 , w 2 , u 2 . Let the permutation shift of the 4-cycle w 1 , u 1 , w 2 , u 2 , w 1 be Π 1 . Therefore the permutation shift Π W 3 of walk W 3 is Π W 3 = Π 1 + Π 1 = (2Π 1 ) N . That is, for having a non-zero Π W 3 , (2Π 1 ) N = 0, or equivalently Π 1 = 0 and Π 1 = N/2 for an even N , and Π 1 = 0 for an odd N .\nGiven a base graph, by enforcing all (or some of) the con- straints discussed above on the permutation shifts of 4-cycles involved in structures of Figures 4(b)-(e), one can derive a lower bound on the lifting degree that would result in a lifted graph with girth at least 10. In the following, we provide such bounds starting with the special case of a fully connected base graph.\nConsider the structure of Figure 4(b). There are several ways to count the number of 4-cycles sharing a speciﬁc node. For instance, one approach is to subtract the number of 4-cycles of the base graph after removing the node from the graph, from the total number of 4-cycles in the graph. For an m × n fully connected base graph, the number of distinct 4-cycles is\n= nm(n−1)(m−1) 4 \t . Removing any variable node, the number of 4-cycles in the resulting graph is (n−1)m(n−2)(m−1) 4 \t .\nSimilarly, after removing a check node, the number of 4-cycles in the new graph is n(m−1)(n−1)(m−2) 4 \t . This implies that for a fully connected base graph, each variable node is contained in m(m − 1)(n − 1)/2 4-cycles and each check node is contained in n(n − 1)(m − 1)/2 4-cycles. The consequence of this result and the discussion presented earlier on the tailless backtrackless closed walks of Figures 4(b)-(e) is the following lemma.\nLemma 5: For any QC protograph code constructed using an m × n fully-connected base graph, the necessary condition to have a girth of at least 10, is that the lifting degree N ≥ n(n − 1)(m − 1) + 1.\nThe fact that any two distinct 4-cycles which have at least one node in common must have different non-zero permutation shifts can be used to tighten the bound for special cases. For instace, for a 3×n fully-connected base graph, it is easy to see that any two 4- cycles in the base graph have at least one check node in common. This together with the fact that there are 3n(n − 1) distinct 4- cycles in such a base graph results in the following lemma.\nLemma 6: For any QC protograph code constructed using a 3 × n fully-connected base graph, the necessary condition to have a girth of at least 10, is that the lifting degree N ≥ 3n(n − 1) + 1.\nExample 2: Consider the TSF (155, 64) code [17], con- structed using a fully-connected base graph of size 3 × 5 and a lifting degree of 31. The maximum girth for the Tanner graph of this code based on all the existing work is 12. This is while based on Lemma 6, the minimum lifting degree using this base graph which can result in a girth larger than 8 for the lifted graph is 3n(n − 1) + 1 = 61. That is, using this base graph and the lifting degree 31, the girth of all possible lifted graphs is at most 8, regardless of the edge permutations used. It should be mentioned that the girth of the Tanner graph of TSF (155, 64) code is also 8, which is the highest possible based on Lemma 6.\nExample 3: According to Lemma 3, in order to have a girth of at least 10 in the QC protograph construction using a fully connected 3 × 5 base graph, the lifting degree must be N ≥ 61. A construction which achieves this bound is presented in [17].\nFor an arbitrary regular or irregular base graph, we have the following result.\nLemma 7: For any QC protograph code constructed using a base graph with no parallel edges, the necessary condition to have a girth at least 10, is that the lifting degree N > Max{N u i 4 , N w j 4 }, where the maximum is taken over all variable nodes u i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and all check nodes w j , 1 ≤ j ≤ m, and N u i 4 and N w j 4 are the numbers of distinct 4-cycles containing the variable node u i and the check node w j , respectively.\nNote that, as the size of base graphs is usually small, it is easy to ﬁnd the values N u i 4 and N w j 4 . It is also straightforward to see that for any variable node u i , N u i 4 ≤ ( d ui 2 )(d w,max − 1), and for any check node w j , N w j 4 ≤ ( d wj 2 )(d u,max − 1), where d w,max and d u,max are the maximum check node degree and the maximum variable node degree in the base graph, respectively. These upper bounds can be used to obtain an approximation for the minimum value of N .\nExample 4: Consider the (2048, 1723) rate- 0.8413 regular LDPC code adopted in IEEE 802.3an. This code is constructed using\na fully connected base graph of size 6 × 32 and a lifting degree of 64, and its Tanner graph has girth 6 . Table I shows the minimum required lifting degrees for different girth values of a graph cyclically lifted from a 6 × 32 fully-connected base graph.\nBased on Table I, one can see that the code used in IEEE 802.3an has the highest possible girth."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
