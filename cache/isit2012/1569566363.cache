We brieﬂy summarize the facts about association schemes used below (this section is mostly adopted from [2, ch. 2]). Given a ﬁnite space X, a symmetric association scheme A(X, R = (R 0 , R 1 , . . . , R s )) is a partition of the set X × X into s classes such that\n(iii) there are numbers p k ij such that for any (x, y) ∈ R k the number of z ∈ X with (x, z) ∈ R i and (y, z) ∈ R j equals p k ij .\nThe adjacency matrix A i of the class R i is deﬁned by (A i ) xy = 1 (x,y)∈R i , i = 0, 1, . . . , s.\nThe matrices A i generate an (s+1)-dimensional commutative C-algebra A (the Bose-Mesner algebra of A). This algebra has a basis of primitive idempotents (E i , i = 0, 1, . . . , s). Deﬁne matrices P and Q, called the eigenvalues of A, by\nThe numbers v i = p 0 ii and m i = rk E i are called the valencies and the multiplicities of the scheme A.\nSuppose that X has the structure of an abelian group. A scheme A is called a translation association scheme if for all R ∈ R\nIn this paper we restrict our attention to the case X = F n q , an n-dimensional linear space. Let d(·, ·) be a metric on X that is invariant by translations. We denote by G = GL d (n) the group of linear isometries of X with respect to d. This group is formed of linear operators T : X → X such that d(T (x), T (y)) = d(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X. The action of G deﬁnes an equivalence relation on X × X where x ∼ y if they belong to the same orbit, i.e. there is T ∈ G such that T (x) = y. Let X := X/∼ be the set of orbits (equivalence classes), |X | = s+1. Consider the partition R = {R α |α ∈ X } of X × X given by\nProof : We need to check the deﬁnition of the association scheme. The subsets R α , α ∈ X form a partition because ∼ is an equivalence relation on X and hence a partition of X × X.\nProperty (i) follows because every T ∈ G is invertible and linear, so T (x) = 0 iff x = 0.\nProperty (ii) (symmetry) follows because G is a group, and so T ∈ G iff T −1 ∈ G.\nLet us verify the intersection property (iii). Let (a 1 , a 2 ) and (b 1 , b 2 ) be representatives of the classes α and β, respectively. Given (x, y) ∈ R γ denote\nSimilarly, T −1 deﬁnes an injective map in the reverse direc- tion, and so |p (x,y) αβ | = |p (x ,y ) αβ |. The translation property of the scheme follows from the corresponding property of the metric.\nIn this paper we consider association schemes of the kind described by this theorem. A translation association scheme A has a dual scheme A ∗ deﬁned by the characters of the group X. A character χ : X → C ∗ is a homomorphism from X into the multiplicative group of complex numbers. Characters\nform a multiplicative group X ∗ with the operation given by (χ 1 χ 2 )(x) = χ 1 (x)χ 2 (x). It is well known that X and X ∗ are canonically isomorphic as groups. Consider the natural action of A on X ∗ induced by the action of the incidence matrices:\nwhere α is the orbit of x under the action of G and χ = (χ(x), x ∈ X) is a vector. Given χ, ψ ∈ X ∗ and α ∈ X we say that (χ, ψ) ∈ R ∗ α iff E α η = η, where η = χ −1 ψ. The dual scheme A ∗ (X ∗ , R ∗ ) satisﬁes the following properties [2]:\n(D1) Let v α , m α be the valencies and multiplicities of the scheme A and let P, Q be its eigenvalues. The scheme A ∗ is a translation association scheme with s classes, valencies v ∗ α = m α , multiplicities m ∗ α = v α , and eigenvalues P ∗ = Q, Q ∗ = P.\nLet C ⊂ X be a linear code. The dual code of C is the subgroup C = {χ ∈ X ∗ |χ(x) = 1 for all x ∈ C}. Even though X ∼ = X ∗ , the codes C and C live in different association schemes that are not necessarily isomorphic. If the \u201clinear-dual\u201d code C ⊥ is deﬁned with respect to an inner product on X × X, then identiﬁcation of C ⊥ and C does not always preserve the association scheme. This distinction is not apparent for the Hamming scheme but becomes important in other cases.\nSuppose that the set of coordinates [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n} is equipped with a partial order P. An order ideal is a subset I ⊂ [n] such that i ∈ I and j i imply that j ∈ I. The P-support of a vector x ∈ X is deﬁned as the smallest ideal supp(x)\nthat contains all the nonzero coordinates of x. The P-norm of x is deﬁned as ω P (x) = | supp(x) |. Brualdi et al. [3] proved that the function d P (x, y) = ω P (x− y) is a translation invariant metric on X. We denote the poset metric space over X = F n q by (X, d P ). The association scheme deﬁned by linear isometries of X (2) is denoted by A(X, R P ) or simply A P .\nExample 1. The Hamming metric is obtained when P is an antichain (no two coordinates are comparable). The group of linear isometries consists of permutations and multiplications by a nonzero constant, i.e., is a semi-direct product G = (F ∗ q ) n S n . The orbits of G deﬁne the Hamming association scheme which gives rise to many results of classical coding theory.\nExample 2. Suppose that n = ms, and the set [n] is a disjoint union of s chains of length m (a chain is a totally ordered set). The P-norm thus arising is called the NRT weight [11]. To give an explicit deﬁnition, write x ∈ X as\n(x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x s ), where x i = (x i1 , . . . , x im ) for all i. Then ω P (x) = i max(j : x i,j = 0), where the sum is extended to the indices of the nonzero blocks x i . The group of linear isometries is found in [7] (it consists of permutations of chains followed by multiplication by upper-triangular matrices of or- der m with nonzero main diagonal). An important observation is that the group G is not transitive on spheres of a given P-radius about 0. To make the action transitive, deﬁne the shape of the vector x ∈ X by shape(x) = (e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e m ), where e i is the number of chains whose rightmost nonzero entry is in position i in the chain, counting from the left. Clearly ω P (x) = i ie i . For instance, let m = 3, s = 4, and x = (010 100 110 111), then shape(x) = (1, 2, 1). We also have ω P (x) = | x | = 8.\nLet N e = {x ∈ X| shape(x) = e} be an e-sphere in X. The action of G is transitive on N e for every e. Thus, the association scheme A(X, R) is formed by the classes R e = {(x, y) ∈ X ×X| shape(x−y) = e} for all e. The NRT metric space X and its association scheme are also called the ordered Hamming space (scheme). It can be shown [8] that relations in the dual scheme A ⊥ are deﬁned by the shapes that follow the order of the dual poset P ⊥ (the weights are measured from the right rather than from the left). The parameters and eigenvalues of the scheme A were further studied in [1].\nExample 3. Suppose that [n] = ◦ 1≤k≤s V k , where i j iff i ∈ V k 1 , j ∈ V k 2 for some k 1 < k 2 , and the elements within each N k form an antichain. This order deﬁnes a hierarchical poset. The group of linear isometries acts transitively on P- spheres, and the MacWilliams relations can be written with respect to the weight enumerators of codes (this is also the only poset metric for which this is possible) [6].\nThe case s = 1 corresponds to the Hamming space. The case |V 1 | = · · · = |V s | = 1 corresponds to a single-chain poset, which is also hierarchical.\nDeﬁnition 1. Let P be a poset on [n]. Deﬁne the dual order P ⊥ on [n] by setting i j iff i j in P.\nPoset-metric automorphisms. A permutation π on the set [n] is called an automorphism of the poset P if the action of π preserves the order relations. Denote by S P the automorphism group of P. For instance, for the Hamming space S P = S n (the symmetric group on n elements) while for a single chain S P = {id}. A poset P is called self-dual if it is isomorphic to its dual P ⊥ , i.e., if there exists a permutation on [n] such that if i P j then π(j) P ⊥ π(i). To give an example, let us represent P by its Hasse diagram in which the vertices correspond to elements of [n] and i j if the vertex i is below the vertex j and is connected to it by an edge.\nOf the two posets in this ﬁgure the left is self-dual while the right is not. The NRT poset is self-dual, including the case of the single chain [8].\nwere computed in [9]. They are formed of poset automor- phisms combined with linear transformations on X that pre- serve the P-support of vectors.\nTwo s-class association schemes A(X, R) and B(X , R ) are called isomorphic if there is a bijection φ : X → X\nsuch that (x, y) ∈ R i if and only if (φ(x), φ(y)) ∈ R π(i) for some ﬁxed permutation of the indices in R . If A and B are translation schemes, then φ agrees with the translations.\nA translation association scheme A(X, R) and its dual scheme A ∗ (X ∗ , R ∗ ) are not always isomorphic. If they are, then the scheme A is called self-dual. The main result of this section is given by the following theorem.\nProof: Let α ∈ X be an orbit of G. For x ∈ X denote by χ x ∈ X ∗ its image under the isomorphism X ∼ = X ∗ . We have χ x (y) = ω (x,y) , where ω is a primitive qth degree root of unity and (x, y) = n i=1 x i y i .\nThe \u201cif\u201d part will be established if we ﬁnd a bijective map φ : X → X ∗ such that (x, y) ∈ R α if and only if (χ φ(x) , χ φ(y) ) ∈ R ∗ π(α) , for some ﬁxed permutation π of the orbits. Let τ be a permutation on [n] that maps P to P ⊥ and let T τ be the corresponding n × n permutation matrix. The matrix T τ deﬁnes a linear isometry on X. Put φ = T τ and consider the sets ˜ R ∗ α = {(χ φ(x) , χ φ(y) )|(x, y) ∈ R α }, ˜ N ∗ α = {χ φ(x) |x ∈ N α }, α ∈ X . Consider the matrices\nThese matrices are symmetric positive semideﬁnite, and have the following properties for any α ∈ X :\nThese properties are veriﬁed by straightforward calculations. For instance, let y ∈ X and compute\nχ \u2020 φ(x) (z)η(z) = 1(η ∈ ˜ N ∗ α )η(y),\nwhere the last step is justiﬁed by standard properties of the characters. Comparing (a)-(c) with (1), (D2), (D3), we con- clude that these matrices form the set of primitive idempotents of A, i.e., ˜ E α = E α , and therefore, ˜ R ∗ α = R ∗ α .\nProposition 3: Let P and Q be two posets deﬁned on [n]. Consider the metric spaces (X, d P ) and (X, d Q ) and let G P and G Q be their groups of linear isometries. Suppose that the translation association schemes A P and A Q deﬁned by the groups G P and G Q are isomorphic. Then the poset-metric spaces (X, d P ) and (X, d Q ) are isometric and the posets P and Q are isomorphic.\nProof : The proof is by induction on n. The base case n = 1 is straightforward. Suppose that the statement is true for every pair of posets P and Q deﬁned on [n − 1]. Let P and Q be posets deﬁned on [n] and suppose that A P ∼ = A Q . In other words, there is a linear isomorphism φ : X → X such that (x, y) ∈ R P,i if and only if (φ(x), φ(y)) ∈ R Q,π(i) for some bijection π between the indices in R P and R Q . Consider a basis β = {e 1 , . . . , e n } of X such that supp(e i ) = {i}. Since φ is an isomorphism, it follows that {φ(e 1 ), . . . , φ(e n )} is a basis of X.\nConsider the poset metric space on F n q induced by the poset Q and the linear isomorphism φ. Namely, for a vector x = i α i φ(e i ) deﬁne the weight ω Q,φ (x) = | {i|α i = 0} Q | where . Q refers to the smallest Q-ideal that contains the sub- set argument. Deﬁne the distance d Q,φ (x, y) = ω Q,φ (x − y). Observe that the poset metric spaces (X, d Q ) and (X, d Q,φ ) are isometric, so the association schemes R Q and R Q,φ are isomorphic.\nDenote by δ P (i, j) the graphical distance between i and j in the Hasse diagram of P and let J − P (i) := {j ∈ [n]|δ P (i, j) = 1}. Let i by a maximal element in P and suppose wlog that i = n (an element i ∈ [n] is called maximal if there does not exist j ∈ P such that i ≺ j). Suppose moreover (again wlog) that j = n − 1 ∈ J − P (n), then e n−1 ∈ e n . Then there is a P-isometry that takes e n = (e n +e n−1 )−e n−1 to e n −e n−1 . It follows that the pairs (e n−1 , e n ) and (e n−1 , e n−1 +e n ) belong to the same class R P,[e n ] ∈ R P . Letting f i = φ(e i ) for all i, we conclude that the pairs (f n−1 , f n ) and (f n−1 , f n + f n−1 ) belong to the same class R Q,[f n ] ∈ R Q . Therefore, there is an isometry that sends f n to f n−1 and (n − 1) Q n. Moreover, clearly n − 1 ∈ J − Q (n) because φ is a linear invertible map. The claim now follows by the induction hypothesis.\nLet A(X, R) be an s-class translation association scheme and let C ⊂ X be a linear code. We deﬁne the inner distribu- tion of C as the vector (a 0 , a 1 , . . . , a s ) where a i = |C ∩ N i | for all i. The inner distribution of the dual code is the vector (a 0 , a 1 , . . . , a s ), where a i = |C ∩ N ∗ i | for all i. These two distributions are related by the MacWilliams equations: a = 1\n|X| a P. This offers a combinatorial motivation for the study of inner distributions of codes in poset metric spaces.\nAs before, consider a poset metric space (X, P) with the translation association scheme (X, R) generated by the orbits of the group of linear isometries. In our case, the sets N α , α ∈ X are the orbits of G P . Generally, more than one index is\nneeded, and the generating function of the inner distribution a becomes a multivariate polynomial. To give an example, consider the NRT poset metric space. The orbits are given by spheres of a ﬁxed shape e = (e 1 , . . . , e m ). Let a e = |{x ∈ C ∩ N e }| be the number of vectors in C of a given shape, then the shape enumerator of C is written as\n(the variable z 0 is introduced to make the polynomial homoge- neous). The MacWilliams relations for the ordered Hamming space connect the enumerators B C and B C by deﬁning a linear transformation of the variables (z 0 , z 1 , . . . , z r ) that changes B C to B C [4]. In communication theory, the shapes charac- terize performance of linear codes when used on transmission channels with certain domination structure [10].\nSince the poset norm does not distinguish between the values of nonzero coordinates, shapes are essentially invariants of ideals rather than vectors. Our goal in this section is to derive an explicit description of orbits for several new examples of posets. Recall that an inﬁnite p-regular rooted tree T is a tree in which all vertices but one have degree p + 1, and the distinguished vertex (the root) has degree p. A regular rooted tree T m with m+1 levels is obtained by taking the subtree of T formed of the vertices connected to the root by paths of length at most m.\nExample: A non-self-dual poset. We begin with an example in which the shapes are easier to describe than in the self-dual cases below. Consider the poset P 0 given by a rooted regular tree T m in which the root is the unique maximal element (an up-rooted tree). In the next example p = 2, m = 2:\nDeﬁne the poset metric space X = (F n q , P 0 ) where the dimension equals the number of vertices, n = p m+1 −1 p−1 . We identify [n] with the set\nWe say that x ∈ X is mono-maximal if |M(x)| = 1 and let M(X, P 0 ) denote the set of mono-maximal elements of the\nposet-metric space. The following lemmas, proved using the characterization of linear isometries [9], are needed to establish the results.\nDeﬁnition 2. Let x ∈ (X, P 0 ) be a vector. The shape of x is deﬁned by shape(x) = (a 0 , a 1 , . . . , a m ), where a i = |M(x)∩ H i | for all i.\nThe main result for the poset space (X, P 0 ) is given by the following theorem.\nThis theorem shows that the action of G P 0 is transitive on shape-spheres. Therefore the relations of the association scheme A(X, R P 0 ) (orbits of G P 0 ) can be labelled by (m+1)- tuples of the form a = (a 0 , a 1 , . . . , a m ), 0 ≤ a i ≤ p i , i = 0, 1, . . . , m. Not all such vectors a can be realized as shapes. This follows because if I, J are ideals in P 0 then either I ∩ J = ∅ or one of them is a subset of the other. Therefore, for instance if a 0 = 1, then a 1 = · · · = a m = 0. In the full form, this argument results in the following proposition.\nThis proposition characterizes the relations of the translation scheme deﬁned by the poset-metric space (X, P 0 ). We have [2, p.45] the following orthogonality relations for the Q- eigenvalues of A :\nwhere the sum extends to all possible shapes and m b = rk E b is the multiplicity value of the scheme. Investigating prop- erties of the eigenvalues implied by this orthogonality is an interesting open question.\nSelf-dual posets: Turning to the main topic of this section, we consider three types of graded self-dual posets: a lattice formed by two p-regular trees T m glued by the leaves, a poset obtained by gluing two trees T m by the root, and a tree and its inverse next to each other. In the ﬁgure below, these posets\nare labelled P 1 , P 2 , P 3 respectively (p = 2). The main result in this part is characterizing the orbits of G P i , i = 1, 2, 3 on (X, P i ) in terms of shapes of vectors. We have the following statement.\nPoset P 1 : p-ary tree with two roots. From the Hasse diagram we see that P 1 has one minimal element and one maximal element. As before, we have a natural grading of the poset P 1 , and denote the levels of the grading by H ⊥ 0 , H ⊥ 1 , . . . , H ⊥ m−1 , H ⊥ m = H m , H m−1 , . . . , H 1 , H 0 , where the H ⊥ i correspond to the levels of the inverted tree, and the H i to the \u201cusual\u201d tree. Clearly |H i | = |H ⊥ i | = p i . The total number of levels is 2m + 1, and the metric space X = F n q is of dimension n = m−1 i=1 2|H i | + |H m | = (p m+1 + p m − 2)/(p − 1). We use the labelling\nwhere the label sets correspond to the levels of the poset in the above order, and Δ is a formal symbol used to distinguish between H i and H ⊥ i .\nIt is not difﬁcult to describe the order P 1 using these labels. Namely, if e ∈ H ⊥ r , a ∈ H ⊥ s , e = 1 2 . . . r ; a = α 1 α 2 . . . α s (the Δ\u2019s are discarded), then e ≺ a iff s < r and the word α 1 α 2 . . . α s is a preﬁx in e. The situation e ∈ H s , a ∈ H r is handled analogously, and if e ∈ H r , a ∈ H ⊥ s , then e ≺ a iff either e is a preﬁx in a or a is a preﬁx in e.\nNow we use the labels to deﬁne a lexicographic order on X. Let pr(a, b) be the common preﬁx of labels a and b and let l(a) = r if a ∈ H r or 2m−r if a ∈ H ⊥ r . Let a = α 1 α 2 . . . α r , b = β 1 β 2 . . . β s (the Δ\u2019s are again discarded). Then we write a < L b if one of the following takes place:\n1. If a ∈ H r and b ∈ H s , then α l(pr(a,b))+1 ≤ β l(pr(a,b))+1 (the ﬁrst symbol of a after the common preﬁx relative to b is less than the corresponding symbol of b, or if a = pr(a, b) (i.e., a ≺ b);\n2. If a ∈ H ⊥ r and b ∈ H ⊥ s , then α l(pr(a,b))+1 ≤ β l(pr(a,b))+1 or b = pr(a, b).\n3. If a ∈ H ⊥ r and b ∈ H s , then α l(pr(a,b))+1 ≤ β l(pr(a,b))+1 . To deﬁne the shape of a vector x ∈ X suppose that the set\nS(x) = (μ 1 , δ 1 , μ 2 , δ 2 , . . . , μ r−1 , δ r−1 , μ r ) where μ i = l(e i ) and δ i = l(e i+1 ) − l(pr(e i , e i+1 )).\nDeﬁnition 3: The shape of a vector x ∈ (X, P 1 ) is deﬁned as shape(x) = (u 0 , u 1 , . . . , u m |v 0 , v 1 , . . . , v m ), where u i = {j|μ j = i} and v i = {j|δ j = i} for all i.\nThis deﬁnition gives a characterization of the orbits of G P 1 on X in terms of the shape of the vectors. The MacWilliams relations for linear codes in (X, P 1 ) are written with respect to shape enumerators expressed by polynomials in 2m + 2 variables. Investigating the rank function of the code in linear- algebraic terms (similarly to the NRT case [10]) is another open question.\nPoset P 2 : The dimension n of the metric space (X, P 2 ) is the same as in the previous example. Let H + be the upper part of the Hasse diagram and H − be its lower part (they intersect by their common root). Let x ∈ X, then Max(supp(x)) ⊆ H − or Max(supp(x) ⊆ H + . Suppose it is the former. Then deﬁne shape(x) = shape − (x), where shape − is given by Deﬁnition 2. Otherwise Max(supp(x)) ⊆ H + , and we deﬁne shape + (x) by ﬂipping the ordering in the arguments leading to Def. 2. Finally, put shape(x) = shape + (x) or shape − (x) depending on which of the two cases is realized. We prove that Theorem 9 is true for the shape thus deﬁned. We also compute the parameters of the association scheme A(X, R) where the classes in R are indexed by the shapes.\nPoset P 3 : Consider the metric space (X, P 3 ). Let H + refer to the right of the two copies of the tree T m (the uprooted tree) and H − to the left one. Given a vector x ∈ X, we deﬁne its partial supports as supp + (x) and supp − (x) in an obvious way. Then Theorem 9 holds true if we put"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A. Bar"},{"name":"P.
