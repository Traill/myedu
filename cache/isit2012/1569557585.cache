The results also directly yield the sum-capacity of a 3-user fully-connected LDIC with symmetric parameters. We further illustrate with an example the potential difÔ¨Åculties in extending the results to asymmetric cases."},"body":{"text":"Fig. 1. 3-user LDICs with different connectivity constraints:(a) many-to-one (b) one-to-many (c) cascade Z (d) cyclic (e) shoe-string (f) crown A (g) crown B (h) fully-connected\n1 The interference connectivities make the channels look like crowns when viewed sideways.
