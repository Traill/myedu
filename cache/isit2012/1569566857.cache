Our problem is a natural generalization of a homogenous storage allocation problem where all the nodes had the same reliability and is naturally motivated for peer-to-peer and cloud storage systems with different types of nodes. Assuming optimal erasure coding (MDS), the goal is to ﬁnd a storage allocation (i.e, how much to store in each node) to maximize the probability of successful recovery. This problem turns out to be a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work we introduce an approximation framework based on large deviation inequal- ities and convex optimization. We propose two approximation algorithms and study the asymptotic performance of the resulting allocations."},"body":{"text":"We are interested in heterogenous storage systems where storage nodes have different reliability parameters. This prob- lem is relevant for heterogenous peer-to-peer storage networks and cloud storage systems that use multiple types of storage devices, e.g. solid state drives along with standard hard disks. We model this problem by considering n storage nodes and a data collector that accesses a random subset r of them. The probability distribution of r ⊆ {1, . . . , n} models random node failures and we assume that node i fails independently with probability 1 − p i . The probability of a set r of nodes being accessed is therefore:\nAssume now that we have a single data ﬁle of unit size that we wish to code and store over these nodes to maximize the probability of recovery after a random set of nodes fail. The problem becomes trivial if we do not put a constraint on the maximum size T of coded data and hence, we will work with a maximum storage budget of size T < n: If x i is the amount of coded data stored in node i, then n i=1 x i ≤ T . We further assume that our ﬁle is optimally coded, in the sense that successful recovery occurs whenever the total amount of data accessed by the data collector is at least the size of the original ﬁle. This is possible in practice when we use Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes [1].\nThe probability of successful recovery for an allocation (x 1 , . . . , x n ) can be written as\nwhere 1{·} is the indicator function. 1{S} = 1 if the statement S is true and zero otherwise.\nA more concrete way to see this problem is by introducing a Y i ∼ Bernoulli(p i ) random variable for each storage node: Y i = 1 when node i is accessed by the data collector and Y i = 0 when node i has failed. Deﬁne the random variable\nwhere x i is the amount of data stored in node i. Then, obviously, we have P s = P[Z ≥ 1].\nOur goal is to ﬁnd a storage allocation (x 1 , . . . , x n ), that maximizes the probability of successful recovery, or equiva- lently, minimizes the probability of failure, P[Z < 1].\nPut in optimization form, we would like to ﬁnd a solution to the following problem.\nAuthors in [1] consider a special case of problem Q1 in which p i = p, ∀i. Even in this symmetric case the problem appears to be very difﬁcult to solve due to its non-convex and combinatorial nature. In fact, even for a given allocation {x i } and parameter p, computing the objective function is computationally intractable (#P -hard , See [1]).\nA very interesting observation about this problem follows directly from Markov\u2019s Inequality: P[Z ≥ 1] ≤ E[Z] = pT . If pT < 1, then the probability of successful recovery is bounded away from 1. This has motivated the deﬁnition of a region of parameters for which high probability of recovery is possible: R HP = {(p, T ) : pT ≥ 1}. The budget T should be more than 1/p if we want to aim for high reliability and the authors in [1] showed that in the above region of parameters, maximally\nspreading the budget to all nodes (i.e, x i = T /n, ∀i) is an asymptotically optimal allocation as n → ∞.\nIn the general case, when the node access probabilities, p i , are not equal, one could follow similar steps to characterize a region of high probability of recovery. Markov\u2019s Inequality yields:\nwhere p = [p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n ] T and x = [x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ] T . If we don\u2019t want P[Z ≥ 1] to be bounded away from 1 we have to require now that p T x ≥ 1. We see that in this case, high reliability is not a matter of sufﬁcient budget, as it depends on the allocation x itself.\nLet S(p, T ) = x ∈ R n + : p T x ≥ 1, 1 T x ≤ T be the set of all allocations x with a given budget constraint T that satisfy p T x ≥ 1 for a given p. We call these allocations reliable for a system with parameters p, T , in the sense that the resulting probability of successful recovery is not bounded away from 1. Then the region of high probability of recovery can be deﬁned as the region of parameters p, T , such that the set S(p, T ) is non-empty.\nThis generalizes the region described in [1]. If all p i \u2019s are equal then the set S(p, T ) is non-empty when p T x = pT ≥ 1. In the general case, the minimum budget such that S(p, T ) is non-empty is T = 1/p max , with p max = max{p i }, and S(p, 1/p max ) contains only one allocation x p −1\nEven though R HP provides a lower bound on the minimum budget T required to allocate for high reliability, it doesn\u2019t provide any insights on how to design allocations that achieve high probability of recovery in a distributed storage system. This motivates us to move one step further and deﬁne a region of -optimal allocations in the next section.\nWe say that an allocation (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ) is -optimal if the corresponding probability of successful recovery, P[Z ≥ 1], is greater than 1 − .\nbe the set of all -optimal allocations. Note that if we could efﬁciently characterize this set for all problem parameters, we would be able to solve problem Q1 exactly: Find the smallest\nIn this section we will derive a sufﬁcient condition for an allocation to be -optimal and provide an efﬁcient character- ization for a region H n ⊆ E n (p, T, ). We begin with a very useful lemma.\nConsider the random variable W = n i=1 V i , where V i are independent almost surely bounded random variables with P (V i ∈ [a i , b i ]) = 1. Then,\nWe can use Lemma 1 to upper bound the probability of failure, P[Z < 1] ≤ P[Z ≤ 1], for an arbitrary allocation, since Z = n i=1 x i Y i can be seen as the sum of n independent almost surely bounded random variables V i = x i Y i , with P V i ∈ [0, x i ] = 1. Let δ = \t n i=1 x i p i − 1 /n and require δ > 0 ⇔ n i=1 x i p i > 1. Lemma 1 yields:\n(3) Notice that the constraint n i=1 x i p i > 1 requires the alloca- tion (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ) to be reliable and S(p, T ) = ∅.\nIn view of the above, a sufﬁcient condition for a strictly reliable allocation to be -optimal is the following.\nWe say that all allocations satisfying the above equation are Hoeffding -optimal , due to the use of Hoeffding\u2019s Inequality in Lemma 1.\nThe above region is strictly smaller E n (p, T, ) for any ﬁnite n, because the bound in (3) is not generally tight. However, H n (p, T, ) is a convex set: Equation (4) can be seen as a second order cone constraint on the allocation x ∈ R n + .\nTheorem 1. The region of Hoeffding -optimal allocations H n (p, T, ) is convex in x.\nThis interesting result allows us to formulate and efﬁciently solve optimization problems over H n (p, T, ). Finding the smallest ∗ such that H n (p, T, ) is non-empty will produce an ∗ -optimal solution to problem Q1.\nIf we ﬁx p, T, n as the problem parameters, then the following optimization problem can be solved efﬁciently, to any desired accuracy 1/α, by solving a sequence of O(log α) convex feasibility problems (bisection on ).\nWe will see next that if T is sufﬁciently large, ∗ goes to zero exponentially fast as n grows, and hence the solution to the aforementioned problem is asymptotically optimal.\nB. Maximal Spreading Allocations and the Asymptotic Opti- mality of H1\nLemma 2. If T > 1/¯ p, for any > 0, ∃n : x n T ∈ H n (p, T, ), for all n ≥ n .\nThe above lemma establishes the asymptotic optimality of maximal spreading allocations through the following corollary.\nCorollary 1. The probability of failed recovery, P e P[Z < 1], for a maximal spreading allocation is P e ≤ e −2n( ¯ p−1/T ) 2 . When T > 1/¯ p, P e → 0, as n → ∞.\nThe fact that H n (p, T, ) contains maximal spreading allo- cations for T > 1/¯ p, provides a sufﬁcient condition on the asymptotic optimality of H1.\nTheorem 2. Let ∗ be the optimal value of H1. If T > 1/¯ p, then ∗ = O(exp(−n)).\nProof: Let T > 1/¯ p and consider the maximal spreading allocation x n T . Then, ∗ ≤ s , where s is the minimum such that x n T ∈ H n (p, T, ). That is s = e −2n( ¯ p−1/T ) 2 , and since T > 1/¯ p, ∗ ≤ s = O(exp(−n)).\nIn this section we take a different approach to obtain a tractable convex relaxation for Q1 by minimizing an appro- priate Chernoff upper bound.\nLemma 3. (Upper Bound) Let Z = n i=1 x i Y i , x i ≥ 0, Y i ∼ Bernoulli(p i ) and t ≥ 0. The probability of failed recovery, P[Z < 1], is upper bounded by\nNote that g t (x) is a weighted sum of convex functions with linear arguments, and hence convex in x. Equation (7) makes the convex relaxation of the objective function apparent:\nBefore we move forward and state the relaxed optimization problem, we take a closer look at the constraint set S = {x ∈ R n + : 1 T x ≤ T } of the original problem Q1. From a practical perspective, it should be wasteful to allocate more than one unit of data (ﬁlesize) on a single node. If the node survives, then the data collector can always recover the ﬁle using only one unit of data and hence any additional storage does not help. Also, an allocation using less than the available budget cannot have larger probability of successful recovery.\nIn the following lemma, we show that it is sufﬁcient to consider allocations with x i ∈ [0, 1] and n i=1 x i = T .\nLemma 4. For any x ∈ S, ∃x ∈ S = {x ∈ R n + : 1 T x = T, x i ≤ 1, i = 1, . . . , n} such that P [ n i=1 x i Y i < 1] ≤ P [ n i=1 x i Y i < 1].\nThe relaxed optimization problem can be formulated as follows.\nNote that, in general, one would like to minimize inf t≥0 {g t (x)} instead of g t (x) for some t ≥ 0. However, for now, we will let t be a free parameter and carry on with the optimization.\nThe important drawback of the above formulation hides in the objective function: Although convex, g t (x) has an exponentially long description in the number of storage nodes: The sum is still over all subsets r ⊆ {1, . . . , n}. This can be circumvented if we consider minimizing log g t (x) = t +\nlog (1 − p i + p i e −tx i ) instead of g t (x) over the same set.\nProof: Let x ∗ = arg min x∈S g t (x). Then g t (x ∗ ) ≤ g t (x), ∀x ∈ S. Taking the logarithm on both sides pre- serves the inequality since log(·) is strictly increasing. Hence, log g t (x ∗ ) ≤ log g t (x), ∀x ∈ S and subtracting t +\nlog(1 − p i ) from both sides yields the desired result and completes the proof.\nIn view of Lemmas 5 and 6, we can solve R1 through the following equivalent optimization problem.\nR2 is a convex separable optimization problem with poly- nomial size description and in terms of complexity, it is \u201cnot much harder\u201d than linear programming [5]. One can solve such problems numerically in a very efﬁcient way using standard, \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d algorithms and optimization packages such as CVX [6], [7].\nHere, we move one step further and take the KKT conditions for R2 in order to take a closer look at the structure of the optimal solutions. Let r i \t p i 1−p\n. The Lagrangian for R2 is:\nwhere λ ∈ R, u, v ∈ R n + are the corresponding Lagrange multipliers. The gradient is given by x i L(x, u, v, λ) = − r i t r\n+λ−u i +v i , and the KKT necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for optimality yield:\n0 ≤ x ∗ i ≤ 1 , ∀i \t (10) λ ∈ R , v i , u i ≥ 0 , ∀i \t (11) v i (x i − 1) = 0 , u i x i = 0 , ∀i \t (12)\nUsing the results from [8], the optimal solution to R2 is given by\n \n1 t\nNumerically, λ ∗ can be computed via an iterative O(n 2 ) algorithm described in [8], and hence this approach gives an even more efﬁcient way to solve R2.\nHowever, the most important aspect of the above result is that we can use equations (13), (14) to obtain closed form solutions for a certain region of problem parameters and analyze the performance of the resulting allocations.\nIt is clear that the optimal solution to R2 depends on our choice of t ≥ 0. For example, r i t e t +r\n→ ∞, as t → ∞ and x ∗ i = lim\nt −1 log (r i t/λ ∗ − r i ), ∀i. Equation (14) yields x ∗ i = T n , ∀i and hence the maximal spreading allocation becomes optimal for R2 as t → ∞. Even though this motivates the choice of maximal spreading allocations as approximate \u201cone-shot\u201d solutions 1 for the original problem Q1, explicitly tuning the parameter t can provide signiﬁcantly better approximations.\nIn order to obtain the tightest bound from Lemma 3, we have to jointly minimize the objective in R2 with respect to t ≥ 0 and x. Towards this end, one can iteratively optimize R2 by ﬁxing the value of one variable (t or x) at each step and minimizing over the other. After each iteration the objective function decreases and hence the above procedure converges to a (possibly local) minimum. The above algorithm iteratively tunes the Chernoff bound introduced in this section and produces a minimizing allocation that can serve as an approximate solution to the original problem Q1.\nFor analytic purposes though, we can choose a value for t as follows. Recall from Lemma 3 that P[Z < 1] ≤ g t (x) for any t ≥ 0. After taking logarithms, we would like to ﬁnd a value for t ≥ 0 that minimizes b(t) t + n i=1 log(1 + r i e −tx i ). Notice that b(t) is a convex function of t, with b(t) > 0, ∀t ≥ 0, b(0) = n i=1 log(1 + r i ) and lim t→∞ b(t) = ∞. The slope of b(t) at zero is b (0) = 1 − n i=1 r i x i 1+r\n= 1 − n i=1 p i x i , which is negative if the allocation is reliable.\nWhen t is large, log(1 + r i e −tx i ) ≈ 0, whereas for small values of t, log(1 + r i e −tx i ) ≈ −tx i + log r i and hence b(t) ≈ t + n i=1 max{−tx i + log r i , 0} ≥ t + max{− n i=1 tx i + log r i , 0}. One way to choose t that does not depend on x i is to make − n i=1 tx i + log r i = 0 ⇒ t = 1 T n i=1 log r i .\nIn view of the above results we provide here a closed form allocation (each x i is given as a function of p and T) that can be used to study the asymptotic performance of R2 and serve as a better \u201cone-shot\u201d approximate solution to Q1.\nLet E (·) be a shorthand notation for the sample average such that 1 n n i=1 f (x i ) ≡ E f (x), in order to simplify the expressions. For the above choice of t = 1 T n i=1 log r i = nE log r/T , equation (13) becomes:\n   \n  \n, r max = max{r i }, then x ∗ i = T nElog r log r i , ∀i.\n. Then from Eq.(14), λ ∗ = nElog r 2T and x ∗ i = T nElog r log r i . λ ∗ is indeed in the required interval if nElog r 2T < r i 1+r\nClearly, when all p i > 1/2, ˆ x n T : x i = T nElog r log r i , ∀i, is a feasible suboptimal allocation for Q1. It is also suboptimal for R2 in general, since solving R2 via the proposed algorithms can only achieve a smaller probability of failed recovery. We have P e {Q1} ≤ P e {R2} ≤ P \t n i=1 T nElog r log r i Y i < 1 .\nIn the following lemma we give an upper bound on the prob- ability of failed recovery for ˆ x n T and establish its asymptotic optimality.\n: x i = T nElog r log r i , ∀i, is strictly reliable, and the probability of failed recovery, P e = P[Z < 1], is upper bounded by\n  \n  \nNotice that ˆ x n T is reliable for values of T for which a maximal spreading allocation x n T is not, since 1 ¯ p ≥ Elog r Ep log r , and hence its probability of failed recovery P e goes to zero exponentially fast for smaller values of T .\nIn this section we evaluate the performance of the proposed approximate distributed storage allocations in terms of their probability of failed recovery and plot the corresponding\nbounds. In our simulations we consider an ensemble of dis- tributed storage systems with n = 100 nodes, in which the corresponding access probabilities, p i ∼ U (0.5, 1), are drawn uniformly at random from the interval (0.5, 1).\nWe consider the following allocations. 1) Maximal spread- ing : x i = T n , ∀i. 2) Chernoff closed-form: x i = (T /nE log r) log r i , ∀i. 3) Hoeffding -optimal: obtained by solving H1. 4) Chernoff iterative: obtained by solving R2 and iteratively tuning the parameter t.\nFig.1 shows, in solid lines, the ensemble average probability of failed recovery of each allocation, P [ n i=1 x i Y i < 1], ver- sus the maximum available budget T . In dashed lines, Fig.1 plots the corresponding bounds on P e obtained from Corollary 1, Lemma 8 and the objective functions of H1, R1."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"D. Leon"},{"name":"A.
