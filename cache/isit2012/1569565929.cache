For certain algebraic code constructions, DMT-optimality has been shown to be linked to algebraic criteria, such as the non- vanishing determinant property in the case of codes based on central division algebras over Q(i). It is natural to ask whether a more general framework to compare the DMT of different types of algebraic space-time code constructions could be established.\nIn [1], Vehkalahti and Lu investigated the relation between DMT, inverse determinant sums and unit groups. On one hand, they showed how the DMT can be used to lower bound the growth of inverse determinant sums; on the other hand, the authors proved that in the case of division algebra based codes, it is possible to upper bound the asymptotic growth of inverse determinant sums by analyzing the unit group of the corresponding order in the algebra. In this paper we are continuing this study and proving that the growth of the inverse determinant sum of a division algebra is completely determined by the growth of the unit group. This reduces the inverse determinant sum analysis to point counting in lattices in Lie groups. This approach does not only give us methods to analyze division algebra codes, but it also reveals a surprisingly tight connection between DMT and certain asymptotic integrals in Lie groups. Most interestingly we ﬁnd that in the case of Q(i) central division algebras the lower bound from information theory and the point counting upper bound coincide.\nWe begin with extending the DMT based lower bounds for inverse determinant sums from [1] to the case where the code lattice is not full rank. We then introduce lattices in Lie groups and review some recent results from [7] on the asymptotic growth of the cardinality of the intersection of these lattices with a sphere, which is shown to depend only on the volume of the sphere. Then we consider Q(i)-central division algebras and prove how the corresponding inverse determinant sums can be analyzed by realizing part of the unit group of the division algebra as a lattice subgroup in the Lie group SL n (C). In the last section we give a similar treatment to space-time codes from Q-central division algebras. Here we will also see how the growth of the inverse determinant of a Q-central division algebra depends on the Hasse-invariant at the inﬁnite place. As an example of the tightness of the connections between algebra and information theory we will derive a lower bound for the volume of the sphere inside SL n (H), where H is the Hamiltonian quaternion algebra.\nWe consider a slow fading channel with n t transmit and n r receive antennas, and where the decoding delay is T time units. The channel equation can be written as\nwhere H ∈ M n r ×n t (C) is the channel matrix whose en- tries are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean complex circular symmetric Gaussian random variables with variance 1, and N ∈ M n r ×T (C) is the noise matrix whose entries are i.i.d. zero-mean complex circular symmetric Gaus- sian random variables with variance 1. X ∈ M n t ×T (C) is the transmitted codeword, and ρ represents the signal to noise ratio.\nDeﬁnition 1.1: A space-time code C is a set of (n t × T ) complex matrices. We often use the abbreviation STBC for space-time block code .\nLet us suppose we have a coding scheme, where for each value of ρ we have a code C(ρ) having |C(ρ)| matrices in M n t ×T (C). The rate R(ρ) for the code C(ρ) is then log (|C(ρ)|)/T in bits per channel use, where the logarithm is taken in base 2. Assuming that the scheme fulﬁlls the average\nDeﬁnition 1.2: The scheme C(ρ) is said to achieve spatial multiplexing gain r and diversity gain d if the data rate\nIn the following we will frequently use the \u201ddotted\u201d nota- tion, where for real valued functions f and g we write\nf (M ) . = g(M ), if\nRemark 1.1: We will also use f (M ) . ≥ g(M ) in the case where g(M ) might not have a limit. By this we only mean that g is lower bounded by some function c(M ) where c(M ) . = f (M ).\nDeﬁnition 1.3: A space-time lattice code C ⊆ M n (C) has the form\nwhere the matrices B 1 , . . . , B k are linearly independent over R, i.e., form a lattice basis, and k is called the rank or the dimension of the lattice.\nDeﬁnition 1.4: [17] If the minimum determinant of the lattice L ⊆ M n (C) is non-zero, i.e. it satisﬁes\nwe say that the code has a non-vanishing determinant (NVD). We now consider a coding scheme based on a k-dimensional\nlattice L inside M n (C). For a given positive real number M we deﬁne the ﬁnite code\nC L (ρ) = ρ − rn k L ρ rn k , \t (2) yields the desired number of codewords for multiplexing gain r and for each ρ level. Furthermore, the sets C L (ρ) clearly do satisfy the average energy constraint (1). Henceforth we simply ignore the scaling factor 1 n\nof SNR in the channel equation as it is irrelevant in DMT calculations.\nIn this section we will show how the we can use the DMT to prove lower bounds for the asymptotic growth of inverse determinant sums. At the same time we will get criteria for a code to achieve optimal DMT for multiplexing gain r ∈ [0, 1].\nLet us suppose that we have a k-dimensional lattice L ⊆ M n (C). The ﬁnite codes with multiplexing gain r derived from the spherical coding scheme are\nAssume there are n r receive antennas. Then following the union bound together with PEP based determinant inequality [9], we get the following bound for average error probability for the code C L (ρ rn/k )\nwhere in the above sum (and also in the rest of the paper) the all-zero matrix is always excluded from the sum.\nProposition 2.1: Let L be a k-dimensional NVD-lattice in M n (C). We then have that\nProof: Consider the previously mentioned coding scheme C L (ρ) = ρ − rn k L ρ rn k . As we have shown, the union bound gives us the lower bound (3). The optimal DMT given by Zheng and Tse, on the other hand, gives us that for integer values of r we have that\nfor integer values of r. Let us now set M = 2ρ nr/k and we then have that\nThe maximum here is achieved obviously with r = 0, but in this case we do not have growth for our matrix sum. The next integer point is r = 1. In this case we have\nIn the following we suppose that the spherical coding scheme is used. We will skip the proof of the following result.\nCorollary 2.2: Let us suppose that we have a k-dimensional NVD lattice code L in M n (C). If the corresponding inverse determinant sum achieves the bound of Proposition 2.1, then L achieves the optimal DMT for r ∈ [0, 1].\nLet us now concentrate on the case where the dimension of the lattice code corresponds to available dimensions at\nthe receiving end. In this case we have k = 2nn r and the following.\nCorollary 2.3: Let us suppose that we have a 2nn r - dimensional NVD lattice L, where n r ≤ n in M n (C). We then have that\nIn this section we will consider a Lie group G, where G is SL n (R), SL n (C) or SL n (H), and its lattice subgroups, that are discrete subgroups having ﬁnite covolume. In the following we will discuss the problem of counting the number of points of these subgroups that lie inside a sphere (with respect to the Frobenius norm). We refer the reader to [4] for the relevant deﬁnitions and an introduction to the subject. Here we suppose that SL n (H) is considered as embedded in M 2n (C) by replacing each quaternion element by its common 2 × 2 matrix representation.\nEach of these groups admits a Haar measure that gives us a natural concept of volume vol G . In particular we can consider the volumes of the balls\nwhere B(M ) here refers to all the matrices in G that have Frobenius norm less than M .\nLet us now concentrate on lattice subgroups that are co- compact , meaning that the factor group G/L is compact. In the following two results we suppose that G is one of the previously mentioned Lie groups.\nConsider a Lie group G, a discrete cocompact lattice L ⊂ G and x ∈ G. We then have that\nwhere K is some nonzero constant independent of M . The limit approaches K uniformly for all x ∈ G.\nTheorem 3.2 (Theorem 7.4, [6]): Let us suppose that G is a Lie group. We then have that\nIn the case when G = SL n (R) we have that vol G (B(M )) . = M n 2 −n ( see [5]).\nUsing the methods explained in [6] we can also estimate this volume in the case G = SL n (C), obtaining the following lemma. Due to space limitations we will skip the proof.\nLet us now consider the mathematical theory that most easily gives us high dimensional NVD lattices.\nLet E/F be a cyclic ﬁeld extension of degree n with with Galois group G(E/F ) = σ . Deﬁne a cyclic algebra\nwhere u ∈ D is an auxiliary generating element subject to the relations xu = uσ(x) for all x ∈ E and u n = γ ∈ (F ) ∗ . We assume that D is a division algebra.\nConsidering D as a right vector space over E, every element x = x 0 + ux 1 + · · · + u n−1 x n−1 ∈ D has the following left regular representation as a matrix ψ(x):\n     \nx 0 γσ(x n−1 ) γσ 2 (x n−2 ) · · · γσ n−1 (x 1 ) x 1 \t σ(x 0 ) \t γσ 2 (x n−1 ) \t γσ n−1 (x 2 ) x 2 \t σ(x 1 ) \t σ 2 (x 0 ) \t γσ n−1 (x 3 )\n     \nThe mapping ψ is an injective F -algebra homomorphism that allows us to identify D with its image in M n (C). We refer to det(ψ(x)) = nr(x), x ∈ D are the reduced norm of the element x.\nDeﬁnition 3.1: A Z-order Λ in D is a subring of D, having the same identity element as D, and such that Λ is a ﬁnitely generated module over Z and generates D as a linear space over Q.\nLet D be an index-n F -central division algebra and Λ be a Z order in D. The (right) Solomon zeta function [15] of the order Λ is\nwhere s > 1 and I Λ is the set of right ideals of Λ. When s > 1 this series is converging [17]. However, we can also\nconsider the truncated form of this sum at the point s = 1. In this case we have the following lemma.\nLemma 3.4: If D is an index n F -central division algebra and Λ ⊆ D is a maximal Z-order,\nThe unit group Λ ∗ of an order Λ consists of elements x ∈ Λ such that there exists an y ∈ Λ with xy = 1 A .\nLet us now concentrate on the case where D is an index n Q(i)-central division algebra.\nRemark 4.1: The center Q(i) was chosen for simplicity. We could have chosen any complex quadratic center.\nProposition 4.1: If Λ is a maximal Z-order in an index n division algebra D, then ψ(Λ) is 2n 2 -dimensional NVD lattice in M n (C), with\nAs already seen, the lattice structure of ψ(Λ) allows us to consider the sum\nAccording to Proposition 2.1 we have that for an index n division algebra this sum must grow at least like M 2n 2 −2n in the dotted sense. Let us now prove that this sum will reach this lower bound.\nIn the following lemma we will denote SL n (C) with G. Note that ψ(Λ 1 ) ⊆ SL n (C) and that it is a cocompact lattice subgroup [14, Theorem 1].\nLemma 4.2: Let D be an index-n Q(i)-central division algebra and Λ be a Z order in D. For any x = 0 ∈ Λ, we have\nProof: We know that Λ 1 has a ﬁnite index inside Λ ∗ . Let us now suppose that a 1 , . . . , a j are some representatives of the factor group Λ ∗ /Λ 1 . We then have that\nAs | det(ψ(xa i ))| ≥ 1, we can multiply each ψ(xa i ) with a constant c i such that |c i | ≤ 1 and det(c i ψ(xa i ) = 1. Clearly |ψ(xa i Λ 1 ) ∩ B(M )| ≤ |c i ψ(xa i Λ 1 ) ∩ B(M )| for all i. According to Theorem 3.1 we then have that\nwhere N 1 is independent of x and M . The last dotted-equality follows now from Lemma 3.3.\nRemark 4.2: We note that all our inverse determinant sum results do work for all orders, but for simplicity we consider maximal ones.\nProposition 4.3: Let D be an index n Q(i)-central division algebra and Λ be a maximal Z-order in D. Then, for n r ≥ n we have\nProof: From the ideal theory of orders we have that if xΛ = yΛ, then x and y must differ by a unit. Therefore we can write\nwhere X(M ) is some collection of elements x ∈ Λ, ψ(x) F ≤ M , each generating a separate (right) ideal\ngenerated by elements in B(M )∩ψ(Λ)). According to Lemma 4.2 we can upper bound the previous with\nUsing the inequality between Frobenius norm and determi- nant, we have\nfor any element x ∈ Λ. Together with Proposition 4.1, this implies that\nwhere T and K are some constants independent of M . The ﬁnal result now follows by substituting this to Equation 4.\nCorollary 4.4: Let D be an index n Q(i)-central division algebra and Λ be a maximal Z order in D. Then, for n r ≥ n\nCorollary 4.5: Let D be an index n Q(i)-central division algebra and Λ be a maximal Z order in D. Then, for n r ≥ n the lattice ψ(Λ) achieves the optimal DMT at multiplexing gain r ∈ [0, 1].\nRemark 4.3: We note here that using the DMT bound we get (in a dotted sense) growth M 2n 2 −2n for the inverse determinant sum of an order of a Q(i)-central division algebra, when n r ≥ n.\nLet us now concentrate on the case where the center of the division algebra is Q. In this case we have the following. If Λ is a Z-order in a division algebra D, then ψ(Λ) is n 2 - dimensional NVD lattice in M n (C), with\nDeﬁnition 5.1: Let us suppose that D is an index n Q- central division algebra. If\nWe will refer to the isomorphism given in the previous deﬁnition with ψ 1 . The mapping ψ 1 has exactly the same\nproperties as the mapping ψ gotten by left regular presentation (in particular the results about norms and lattice structure of ψ 1 (Λ) are true).\nIn the following we will denote SL n (H) and SL n (R) with G. Just as before we have that ψ 1 (Λ 1 ) ⊆ G and that it is a cocompact lattice subgroup [14, Theorem 1].\nThe following results can be proved just like their counter- parts in the previous section.\nProposition 5.1: Let D be an index n Q-central division algebra and Λ be a maximal Z order in D. Let us denote ψ 1 (Λ) with L. Then, for n r ≥ n/2 we have\nThe isomorphisms in the previous deﬁnition gives us a Q- algebra embedding ψ 1 from D to M n (C). We then have the following.\nProposition 5.2: Let D be an index n Q-central division algebra and ψ a left regular presentation respect to maximal subﬁeld L. Let Λ be a maximal Z order in D and denote ψ(Λ) with L. Then, for n r ≥ n/2\nSketch of a proof: By considering tensor product induced isomorphisms D ⊗ Q R ⊗ R C ∼ = M n (C) and D ⊗ Q L ⊗ L C ∼ = M n (C), and using Skolem Noether theorem we know that there exists an invertible matrix A ∈ M n (C), such that ψ(Λ) = A −1 ψ 1 (Λ)A. It is easy to see that the inverse determinant sums of ψ 1 (Λ) and Aψ 1 (Λ)A −1 have similar asymptotic behavior. The result then follows from Proposition 5.1.\nCorollary 5.3: Let D be an index n Q-central division algebra where the inﬁnite place is not ramiﬁed and Λ a maximal Z order in D. Let us denote ψ(Λ) with L. Then, for n r ≥ n/2 we have\nCorollary 5.4: Let D be an index n, 2|n, Q-central division algebra where the inﬁnite place is ramiﬁed. Let Λ be a maximal Z order in D and denote ψ(Λ) with L. Then, for n r ≥ n/2\nProof: The right side is just Proposition 5.2 and the left side follows from Proposition 2.1.\nExample 5.1: Let us consider an algebra (Q(i)/Q, σ, −3) and an order Λ = Z[i] ⊗ uZ[i], we can see that Corollary 5.4 gives growth M 0 for the corresponding inverse determinant sum. In here we also know that the unit group of Λ is ﬁnite and therefore vol SL n/2 (H) (B(M )) is constant. This is an example where the bound of Corollary 5.4 is tight (in a dotted sense).\nExample 5.2: Let us now consider an algebra (Q(i)/Q, σ, 3). We can easily prove that this is a division algebra, where inﬁnite place is not ramiﬁed. The left regular presentation gives us an embedding to M 2 (C), but Corollary 5.3 gives that the growth of the inverse determinant sum is in the class M 2 .\nRemark 5.1: These two examples underline the fact that two division algebra codes, that have a fairly similar look, might have totally different inverse determinant sums. This suggest that the performance of the codes can also be dramat- ically different.\nThe research of R. Vehkalahti is supported by the Academy of Finland grants #131745 and #252457.
