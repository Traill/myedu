Open systems can be interconnected with other systems.\nOur interest in this article is in systems with as outcome space a (ﬁnite or) countable set, or R n . If the event space consist of all subsets of the countable outcome space, or of the Borel sets in the case of R n , then we call the σ -algebra of events \u2018rich\u2019, in contrast to \u2018coarse\u2019 σ -algebras. In classical stochastic systems, the event σ -algebra is assumed to be rich. The event σ -algebra is an intrinsic, not to be ignored, feature of the stochastic phenomenon that is modeled.\nThe article functions completely within the orthodox mea- sure theoretic setting of probability, with a σ -algebra of events, the mathematical framework of probability that is usually attributed to Kolmogorov. The main point of this article is basically pedagogical in nature, namely that the emphasis in the teaching of probability on settings where essentially every subset of the outcome space is an event is unduly restrictive, even for elementary applications. Concepts, as linearity, interconnection, and constrained probability, function comfortably only within the context of coarse σ -algebras.\nThis conference paper is a summary of a full article [1] that has recently been submitted.\nW a non-empty set, the outcome space, with elements of W called outcomes,\nE a σ-algebra of subsets of W, with elements of E are called events,\nWe assume that E and P satisfy the standard Kolmogorov axioms.\nTwo important special cases are obtained as follows. We refer to these special cases as classical stochastic systems.\nThe ﬁrst special case is (W, 2 W , P) with W a countable set. P can then be speciﬁed by giving the probability p of the individual outcomes, p : W → [0, 1], and deﬁning P by P(E) = Σ\nassumed to be an event, and P is completely determined by the probability of the singletons.\nThe second special case is a Borel probability (R n , B (R n ) , P), where B (R n ) denotes the class of Borel subsets of R n . P can then be speciﬁed by a probability distribution, or, if the distribution is sufﬁciently smooth, by the probability density function p : R n → [0, ∞) leading to P(E) =\nFor a classical stochastic system \u2018essentially every\u2019 subset of W is an event and is assigned a probability. Thus for classical stochastic systems, the events are obtained from the structure of the outcome space. No probabilistic modeling enters in the speciﬁcation of the events.\nWe illustrate the relevance of coarse σ -algebras by means of a physical example. In Section VII, we will discuss a binary channel .\nA noisy resistor. Consider a 2-terminal electrical circuit shown as a black box in Figure 3(a). The aim is to model the relation between the voltage V and the current I. A deterministic example is an Ohmic resistor, shown in Figure 3(b), described by V = RI with R the resistance.\nAs an example of a noisy circuit, consider a resistor with thermal noise, as shown in Figure 3(c). In the deterministic case, the resistor is modeled by V = RI, while in the stochastic case, it is assumed that the outcomes (V, I) belong to strips parallel to the line V = RI with a certain probability. More concretely, for a Johnson-Nyquist resistor, it is assumed that the probability that (V, I) belongs to the incremental strip x ≤ V − RI ≤ x + dx is equal to 1 √ 2πσ e − x2 2σ 2 dx (see Figure 2(a)). Here, σ ∼ =\nThis noisy resistor deﬁnes a stochastic system with outcome space W = R 2 and as outcomes voltage/current vectors V I ∈ R 2 . The events are the sets of the form\nThis resistor with thermal noise can be represented by equivalent circuits. Either as a deterministic resistor in series with a noisy voltage source, V = RI + ε with ε the voltage generated by the noisy voltage source, taken to be gaussian, zero mean, and with standard deviation σ ∼ =\nRT (see Figure 3(d)). Or as a deterministic resistor in parallel with a noisy\ncurrent source, I = V /R + ε with ε the current generated by the noisy current source, taken to be gaussian, zero mean, and with standard deviation σ ∼ = T /R. Hence, whereas ε and ε are classical random variables, V I is not a classical random vector. Only cylinders with rays parallel to V = RI (see Figure 2) are events that are assigned a probability. In particular, V and I are not classical random variables. Indeed, the basic model of a noisy resistor does not imply a stochastic law for V or I, in the sense that V and I are not classical random variables. The description in terms of the events 1 and their probabilities describes the physics better than these equivalent circuits.\nDeﬁnition 2: Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld, or R. The stochastic system (F n , E ,P) is said to be linear if there exists a linear subspace L of F n such that the events consist of all subsets of the quotient space F n /L when F if a ﬁnite ﬁeld, or of the Borel subsets of F n /L when F = R. F n /L is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over F of dimension = n − dimension(L). L is called the ﬁber and dimension(L) the number of degrees of freedom of the linear stochastic system.\nThe idea behind Deﬁnition 2 is illustrated in Figure 4. The events are cylinders in R n with rays parallel to the ﬁber L. A linear stochastic system is classical if and only if L = {0}. Hence a classical random vector with W = F n deﬁnes a linear stochastic system. At the other extreme, when L = F n , the event set E becomes the trivial σ-algebra {/0,F n }.\nObserve that the deﬁnition of linearity involves only the event σ -algebra, but not the probability measure.\nIn this section we discuss interconnection. We consider the situation illustrated in Figure 5 with the assumption that the two interconnected systems are stochastically independent. Note that interconnection comes down to imposing two distinct probabilistic laws on the same set of variables. Is it possible to deﬁne one law which respects both laws? As we shall see, this is indeed possible, provided some regularity condition, called \u2018complementarity\u2019, holds.\nDeﬁnition 3: Two σ -algebras E 1 and E 2 on W are said to be complementary if for all nonempty E 1 , E 1 ∈ E 1 , E 2 , E 2 ∈ E 2\nTwo systems Σ 1 = (W, E 1 , P 1 ) and Σ 2 = (W, E 2 , P 2 ) are said to be complementary if for all E 1 , E 1 ∈ E 1 and E 2 , E 2 ∈ E 2\nIn words, complementarity of stochastic systems requires that the intersection of two events, one from each of the σ -algebras, determines the product of the probabilities of the intersecting events uniquely, while complementarity of the σ -algebras requires that the intersection determines the intersecting sets uniquely.\n[[ E 1 , E 2 complementary, E 1 ∈ E 1 , E 2 ∈ E 2 , and E 1 ∩ E 2 = /0]] ⇒ [[E 1 = /0 or E 2 = /0]],\nand, furthermore, that complementarity of two stochastic sys- tems is implied by complementarity of the associated σ - algebras.\nDeﬁnition 4: Let Σ 1 = (W, E 1 , P 1 ) and Σ 2 = (W, E 2 , P 2 ) be stochastic systems and assume that they are complementary. The interconnection of Σ 1 and Σ 2 , assumed stochastically independent, denoted by Σ 1 ∧ Σ 2 , is deﬁned as the system\nThe deﬁnition of the probability P for rectangles {E 1 ∩ E 2 | E 1 ∈ E 1 , E 2 ∈ E 2 } uses complementarity in an es- sential way. E is the σ-algebra generated by these rectangles. It is readily seen that the class of subsets of W that consist of the union of a ﬁnite number of disjoint rectangles forms an algebra of sets. The probability of rectangles deﬁnes the probability of the union of a ﬁnite number of disjoint rectangles. By the Hahn-Kolmogorov extension theorem, this leads to a unique probability measure P on E .\nObviously, there holds E 1 , E 2 ⊆ E . Also, for E 1 ∈ E 1 and E 2 ∈ E 2 , we have P(E 1 ) = P(E 1 ∩ W) = P 1 (E 1 ) and P(E 2 ) =\nP (W ∩ E 2 ) = P 2 (E 2 ). Hence interconnection reﬁnes the event σ -algebras and the probabilities. Note also that for E 1 ∈ E 1 and E 2 ∈ E 2 , P(E 1 ∩ E 2 ) = P 1 (E 1 )P 2 (E 2 ) = P(E 1 )P(E 2 ). Hence\nE 1 and E 2 are stochastically independent sub-σ -algebras of E . This expresses that Σ 1 and Σ 2 model phenomena that are stochastically independent.\nAs a general principle, it is best to aim for models that are open, and a mathematical theory of modeling should reﬂect this aspect from the very beginning. Models usually leave some of the individual variables free, unexplained, and merely express what one can conclude about a coupled set of variables.\nConsider for example the classical notion of an n- dimensional stochastic vector process as a family of measur- able maps f t : Ω → R n ,t ∈ T (T denotes the time-set), from a basic probability space Ω, with σ -algebra A , to R n , with σ -algebra B(R n ). This is very much a closed systems view, since once the uncertain parameter ω ∈ Ω has been realized, the complete trajectory t ∈ T → f t (ω) ∈ R n is determined. Such models leave no room for the inﬂuence of the environ- ment. Stochastic systems with a coarse σ -algebra do allow to incorporate the unexplained environment.\nAnother way of looking at \u2018open\u2019 versus \u2018closed\u2019 systems is by considering interconnection. An open stochastic system can be interconnected with other systems, a closed system cannot be interconnected (or, more accurately, it can only be inter- connected with a trivial stochastic system). We illustrate that\ncoarseness of the σ -algebras is essential for complementarity in the case the W is countable. Assume that Σ 1 = (W, 2 W , P), with W countable, is a classical stochastic system and that Σ = (W, E , P ) is another stochastic system. Then the σ - algebras associated with Σ 1 and Σ 2 can only be complementary if E is trivial, that is, E = {/0,W}. More generally, if the stochastic systems Σ and Σ are complementary then for E ∈ E , we have E ∩ W = E ∩ E = W ∩ E, and hence P (E) = P(E)P (E) = P (E). Therefore the following zero-one law must hold:\nThis is a very restrictive condition on Σ . For example, if each singleton has positive P-measure, then E = {/0,W}.\nWe conclude that classical stochastic systems are models of closed systems . These systems cannot be interconnected with other systems. Open systems require a coarse σ -algebra. This shows a serious limitation of the classical stochastic framework, since interconnection is one of the basic tenets of model building.\nConsider the stochastic system (W, E , P). Let S be a nonempty subset of W. In this section we discuss the meaning of the stochastic system induced by (W, E , P) with outcomes constrained to be in S. We shall see that this is indeed a sensible concept.\nDeﬁnition 5: Let Σ = (W, E , P) be a stochastic system and S ⊆ W. Assume that the regularity condition\nThe regularity condition basically implies S / ∈ E . In fact, if S ∈ E , then regularity holds if and only if w ∈ S with probability 1, that is, if and only if P(S) = 1.\nNote that constraining essentially corresponds to in- terconnecting (W, E , P) with the \u2018deterministic\u2019 system (W, { /0, S, S complement , W}, P ) with P (S) = 1. The regularity condition corresponds to complementarity.\nThe notion of the stochastic system Σ with outcomes con- strained to be in S, while reminiscent of the notion of the stochastic system Σ conditioned on outcomes in S, is quite distinct from it. The former basically requires S / ∈ E , while the latter requires S ∈ E . Secondly, constraining associates with the event E ∈ E of Σ, the event E ∩ S of Σ| S with probability P (E), while conditioning associates with the event E ∈ E of Σ the event E ∩ S, also in E , with probability P(E ∩S)/P(S). So, constraining pulls the probability of E \u2018globally\u2019 into E ∩ S, while conditioning associates with E \u2018locally\u2019 the probability of E ∩ S, renormalized by P(S).\nOpen stochastic systems are often thought of as classical stochastic systems with \u2018input\u2019 parameters, that is, as a family of probability measures on the output space, parameterized by the input. Such families of probability measures go un- der the name of probability kernels. The main distinction between probability kernels and our approach consists in the input/output view of open systems that underlies probability kernels. While inputs and outputs deﬁnitely have their place in modeling, especially in signal processing and in feedback control, the input/output view of systems has many drawbacks when modeling open physical systems, as argued for example in [2] for the deterministic case: a physical system is not a signal processor. With input/output thinking one cannot get off the ground when modeling, for example, simple electri- cal circuits [3], the paradigmatic examples of interconnected systems.\nDeveloping the themes of the present article using probabil- ity kernels in their full generality lies beyond our scope. We now explain some of the connections between our notion of stochastic system on the one hand, and probability kernels on the other hand, by means of the binary channel. The\nchannel functions as follows. There are two possible inputs, u 0 and u 1 . The channel transmits the input and produces two possible outputs, y 0 and y 1 . The input u 0 leads to output y 0 with probability p 0 and to y 1 with probability 1 − p 0 , while the input u 1 leads to output y 1 with probability p 1 and to y 0 with probability 1 − p 1 . If p 0 = p 1 = p, then we call the channel symmetric, while if p 0 = p 1 , then we call the channel asymmetric . The symmetric binary channel is shown in Figure 6(a), while the asymmetric binary channel is shown in Figure 6(b).\nFormally, denote the input alphabet as U = {u 0 , u 1 } and the output alphabet as Y = {y 0 , y 1 }. The channel is speciﬁed as two classical stochastic systems,\nWe show how to approach the symmetric binary channel using constrained probability. We start with the system\nThus the outcome space, shown in Figure 7(a), is U × Y. The events E consist of the σ-algebra generated by\nThe generating set for E is shown in Figure 7(b). Note that the σ -algebra generated by {E 0 , E 1 } is not equal to 2 U×Y . Σ sbc is not a classical stochastic system. The probability P is determined by\nObserve that Σ sbc | S 0 and Σ sbc | S 1 yields precisely the systems Σ u 0 and Σ u 1 that specify the channel as a probability kernel.\nNote that the symmetric binary channel can be viewed as a linear stochastic system. Identify both U and Y with GF(2), the Galois ﬁeld {0, 1}. Set W = U × Y = GF(2) 2 . Then Σ sbc is a linear stochastic over the ﬁeld GF(2) with ﬁber L = {(0, 0), (1, 1)} and probabilities P(L) = p and P ((0, 1) + L) = 1 − p.\nWe next show how to approach the asymmetric binary channel from our point of view. We start with the system\nwith E = {e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , e 4 }. Thus the outcome space, shown in Figure 8(a), is the Cartesian product of U×Y and E. The space E is introduced in order to generate the channel uncertainty. The events E consist of the σ-algebra generated by\nE 1 = {(u 0 , y 0 , e 1 ), (u 1 , y 0 , e 1 )}, E 2 = {(u 0 , y 0 , e 2 ), (u 1 , y 1 , e 2 )}, E 3 = {(u 0 , y 1 , e 3 ), (u 1 , y 0 , e 3 )}, E 4 = {(u 0 , y 1 , e 4 ), (u 1 , y 1 , e 4 )}.\nThe generating set for E is shown in Figure 8(b). Note that the σ -algebra generated by {E 1 , E 2 , E 3 , E 4 } is not equal to 2 U×Y×E . Σ abc is not a classical stochastic system. The probability P is determined by\nNow consider the stochastic system Σ abc with outcomes constrained to be in\nE 1 = {(y 0 , e 1 )}, \t E 2 = {(y 0 , e 2 )}, E 3 = {(y 1 , e 3 )}, \t E 4 = {(y 1 , e 4 )},\nE 1 = {(y 0 , e 1 )}, \t E 2 = {(y 1 , e 2 )}, E 3 = {(y 0 , e 3 )}, \t E 4 = {(y 1 , e 4 )},\nObserve that after elimination of e, that is, the marginal prob- ability for y, Σ abc | S 1 and Σ abc | S 2 yields precisely the systems Σ u 0 and Σ u 1 from that specify the channel as a probability kernel.\nThe introduction of E and Σ abc shows that the speciﬁcation of a channel as a probability kernel can be interpreted in a very natural way as constrained stochastic systems. The probability kernel can also be interpreted in terms of conditional probabil- ities by deﬁning, for π ∈ [0, 1], P u (u 0 ) = π and P u (u 1 ) = 1 − π. We then obtain stochastic systems with Σ u 0 and Σ u 1 the conditional probabilities of y given u. Since the interpretation of the probability kernel as conditional probabilities requires modeling the environment, that is, interpreting the input u as a classical random variable, we feel that the interpretation in terms of constrained probability is a more satisfactory one conceptually.\nWhen ε a classical random vector, then y = f (u, ε) can be dealt with by considering u as an input parameter which together with ε generates the output y. For example, the symmetric binary channel can be realized this way by taking U = Y = {0, 1}, ε a random variable taking values in {0, 1} with P ε (0) = p, P ε (1) = 1− p, and setting u+y = ε over GF(2). The asymmetric binary channel can be realized by setting U = Y = {0, 1}, and y = ε 0 (1−u)+ε 1 u with ε 0 , ε 1 independent random variables both taking values in {0, 1} with P(ε 0 = 0) = p 0 and P(ε 1 = 1) = p 1 .
