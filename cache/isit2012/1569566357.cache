It works by splitting communication across a pair of fading matrices. However, it comes with the overhead of a long time delay until matchable matrices occur: the delay is q n 2 for ﬁeld size q.\nIn this paper, we outline two new families of schemes, called JAP and JAP-B, that reduce the expected delay, sometimes at the cost of a reduction in rate from the NGJV scheme. In particular, we give examples of good schemes for networks with few users, and show that in large n-user networks, the delay scales like q T , where T is quadratic in n for a constant per-user rate and T is constant for a constant sum-rate. We also show that half the single-user rate can be achieved while reducing NGJV\u2019s delay"},"body":{"text":"Interference alignment [1], [2] describes a set of techniques that allow communication in multiuser networks at much higher rates than standard resource division schemes such as TDMA. Interference alignment schemes work by \u2018aligning\u2019 all interfering signals so they can be cancelled together.\nGiven a fast-fading channel \u2013 that is a channel with in- dependent and identically distributed (IID) fading coefﬁcients in each time slot \u2013 Nazer, Gastpar, Jafar and Vishwanath [3] proposed a scheme, which we call the NGJV scheme. In brief, the NGJV scheme pairs together communications using fading matrix H with those using fading matrix I − H, providing a situation with no interference between receivers. (We outline the NGJV scheme in more detail in Section III.)\nThe NGJV scheme can be regarded as optimal for an n- user interference network, since half the single-user rate is achievable for each user, no matter how large n is [3], [4], [5], [6]. However, this is achieved at the cost of a signiﬁcant delay in communications.\nFor deﬁniteness, we consider a model of communication over a ﬁnite ﬁeld F q of size q. Since the NGJV scheme requires a particular n × n channel matrix with entries in F q \\ {0} to occur, the expected delay for a given message is (q − 1) n 2 , which is roughly q n 2 for large q. It is clear that even for n and q relatively small, this is not a practical delay. For n = 6 and q = 3, for example, the delay is 2 36 ≈ 7 × 10 10 .\n1) Can we ﬁnd a scheme that, like NGJV, achieves half the single-user rate, but has a shorter delay?\n2) Can we ﬁnd schemes that have shorter delays than NGJV, even at some cost to the rate achieved?\n3) Speciﬁcally, which schemes from Question 2 perform well for situations where we have few users (n small)?\n4) Speciﬁcally, which schemes from Question 2 perform well for situations where we have many users (n → ∞)?\nJAP (Subsection IV-A), a beamforming extension JAP-B (Sub- section IV-B), and child schemes derived from them (Section IV-D) that have lower time delays than the NGJV scheme for a variety of different rates, answering Question 2. As a special case, the JAP-B(n) schemes (Subsection IV-C) achieve half the single-user rate, like NGJV, while reducing the delay from q n 2 to q (n−1)(n−2) , answering Question 1. In Section V, we answer Questions 3 and 4, by ﬁnding and analysing the JAP- B schemes that perform the best for small and large n; Table 1 and Figure 1 illustrate the best schemes for small n, and Theorems 6 and 7 give the asymptotic behaviour. Question 5 remains an open problem, although we do give bounds on the delay achievable for the best schemes listed above.\nKoo, Wu and Gill [7] have attempted to answer Questions 2 and 3. We brieﬂy outline their work in Section III.\nA slightly longer version of this paper is available online [8], with more detailed results and complete proofs.\nSince ergodic interference alignment relies on matrices being exactly aligned, Nazer et al [3] give their main results in the context of the ﬁnite ﬁeld channel, where there are only ﬁnitely-many possible fading matrices. They then use a quantisation argument to apply their results to the Gaussian case. In order to allow comparison of our results, we use the same ﬁnite ﬁeld model.\nEach transmitter i has an independent message w i ∈ F m i q , which it encodes as a codeword (x i [1], . . . , x i [N ]) of block length N , giving rate R i = (log q m i )/N = m i N log q.\nand needs to decode the message w j . We can rewrite (1) in matrix form as Y[t] = H[t]x[t] + Z[t]. (Throughout, matrices are in sans-serif and vectors in bold.) We call H[t] the channel matrix or fading matrix. As in [3], the noise terms Z j [t] are IID sequences from a distribution on F q that is a mixture of a uniform distribution and a point mass at zero:\nLike [3], we use an \u2018ergodic\u2019 model, where the channel coefﬁcients H ji [t] are drawn IID and uniformly from the ﬁeld F q \\ {0} and are redrawn for each time slot.\nWe assume all transmitters and receivers have full causal channel state information for all transmitter\u2013receiver pairs.\nBy a simple mutual information maximisation, it is easy to show that the capacity of the single-user ﬁnite ﬁeld channel Y = Hx + Z for a constant H = 0 is D(Z) := log q − H(Z), where H(Z) is the entropy of Z.\nSchemes for the ﬁnite ﬁeld interference channel often allow each user pair to achieve a ﬁxed fraction of the single-user rate. We refer to the \u2018pre-D(Z) term\u2019 as the degrees of freedom.\nDeﬁnition 1: Given an achievable symmetric rate point (R, . . . , R), we deﬁne the degrees of freedom to be DOF = R/D(Z).\nThe NGJV scheme [3] is based on an idea from previous work of Nazer and Gastpar [9] involving the performance of ﬁnite-ﬁeld multiple-access channels.\nEach receiver\u2019s problem takes the form of (1). Rather than reconstructing a single message w j (or all messages w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n ) as receiver j would normally wish to do, it can be shown [9, Theorem 1], [3, Lemma 3] that receiver j can actually recover the \u2018pseudomessage\u2019 n i=1 H ji w i at rate D(Z). This is done by all transmitters using the same linear code, so for all i, (x i [1], . . . , x i [N ]) = Gw i , for an appropriate m × N generator matrix G.\nThe NGJV scheme works as follows. Each transmitter i sends two signals encoding the same message w i ; ﬁrst when the channel matrix is H, and second when the channel matrix is H := I − H. In the ﬁrst time slot, each receiver j can decode the pseudomessage n i=1 H ji w i , using the argument above. The receiver stores this pseudomessage in its memory. In the second time slot it can decode the pseudomessage\nH ji w i , which it also stores in its memory. The receiver then adds together these two estimates of pseudomessages, to get its own message\nSince both pseudomessages can be communiated at rate D(Z), we conclude that each transmitter can send its message to its receiver at rate D(Z)/2, since two channel uses are needed per message. This corresponds to DOF = 1/2.\nWe deﬁne the expected time delay for the NGJV scheme to be the average number of time slots we must wait after seeing a channel matrix H until we see the corresponding matrix I − H. The time delay is geometrically distributed with mean 1/p, where p is the probability that the random channel matrix takes the value I − H. Hence ﬁnding the average time delay is reduced to ﬁnding the probability that the desired matrix appears in the next time slot. Since a channel matrix has n 2 entries, each of which needs to take the correct one value of q − 1 possible values, the average time delay is\n(Here and elsewhere, we write f (q) ∼ g(q) if f (q)/g(q) → 1 as q → ∞.)\nSince this expected delay will be quite large even for modest values of q and n, we will concentrate on the delay exponent.\nDeﬁnition 2: An interference alignment scheme with ex- pected delay D ∼ Cq T for some C and T has delay exponent T and delay constant C. Formally, T := lim q→∞ log D/ log q.\nReduction of the delay exponent is the key aim, with the delay coefﬁcient playing a secondary role. Since the ﬁnite ﬁeld model is in some sense an a quantisation of the continuous case, q should be large enough for accurate quantisation. Alternatively, for ﬁxed quantisation quality, SNR scales like q 2 , so the high-SNR region corresponds to large q. When q is large, the delay exponent T dominates the delay constant C in determining size of the expected delay D.\nFrom (2), we see that the NGJV scheme, which achieves DOF = 1/2, has a delay exponent of n 2 .\nFor comparison, time-division multiple access (TDMA), where each transmitter\u2013receiver pair has sole access to the channel for an nth of the total time, achieves DOF = 1/n for an expected delay D = n = nq 0 , and hence a delay exponent of T = 0. To an extent, our new schemes can be seen as \u2018interpolating\u2019 between the extremes of NGJV (high rate, high delay) and TDMA (low rate, low delay).\nWe also mention some new schemes due to Koo, Wu and Gill [7] (KWG). They attempted to answer Questions 2 and 3, by ﬁnding schemes with lower delay than NGJV. The KWG schemes suggest matching a larger class of matrices than simply H and I − H. By analysing the hitting probability of an associated Markov chain, they were able to reduce the expected delay, at the cost of a reduction in rate and hence degrees of freedom. However, their schemes only affect the delay by a constant multiple, with the most successful scheme only reducing the delay to 0.64(q −1) n 2 ∼ 0.64q n 2 for a sum- rate of 0.79D(Z). That is, they only reduce the delay constant C, leaving the delay exponent as T = n 2 . For modest q and n, say q = 3, n = 6, again, we regard this delay as still impractical. Since the KWG schemes achieve a lower rate than the NGJV scheme for the same delay exponent, we need only compare our results with the NGJV scheme.\nThe NGJV scheme has a long delay as after seeing the ma- trix H[t 0 ], we have to wait for a single matrix H[t 1 ] = I−H[t 0 ] to appear to simultaneously complete the linear dependences\nWe can widen the range of acceptable matrices \u2013 and so reduce the expected delay \u2013 by\n\u2022 Building the dependences with more than two matrices; \u2022 Forming any linear combination rather than just a sum;\n\u2022 Allowing transmitters to complete their dependences at different times, rather than simultaneously;\n\u2022 Recovering a multiple of the desired message, rather than the message itself.\nλ 0 H jj [t 0 ] + λ 1 H jj [t 1 ] + · · · + λ K H jj [t K ] = λ = 0 (3) λ 0 H int j [t 0 ] + λ 1 H int j [t 1 ] + · · · + λ K H int j [t K ] = 0, \t (4)\nthen receiver j can recover its message from H[t 0 ], H[t 1 ], . . . , H[t K ] by forming the linear combination of pseudomessages\nThe time delay for user j is t K − t 0 , and they have communcated at rate D(Z)/(K + 1) for DOF = 1/(K + 1).\nStart by ﬁxing K ≤ n and a sequence a = (a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a K ) of length K and weight n, so in the set\nand write A k for the partial sums A k := a 1 + · · · + a k . Then we deﬁne the scheme JAP(a) as consisting of the following K + 1 steps:\n\u2022 Step 1: Set t 1 to be the ﬁrst time slot that allows the ﬁrst a 1 receivers 1, 2, . . . , A 1 to recover their message from H[t 0 ], H[t 1 ].\n\u2022 Step k: Set t k to be the ﬁrst time slot that allows the next a k receivers A k−1 + 1, A k−1 + 2, . . . , A k to recover their message from H[t 0 ], H[t 1 ], . . . , H[t k ].\n\u2022 Step K: Set t K to be the ﬁrst time slot that allows the ﬁnal a K receivers A K−1 + 1, A K−1 + 2, . . . , A K to recover their message from H[t 0 ], H[t 1 ], . . . , H[t K ].\nBy the end of this process, all n = A K receivers have recovered their message.\nSince the message was split over K + 1 time slots, the common rate of communication is D(Z)/(K + 1), which corresponds to DOF = 1/(K + 1).\nTheorem 3: Consider the n-user ﬁnite ﬁeld interference network. Fix K and a ∈ A(n, K). We use the scheme JAP(a) as outlined above. Then\n1) the expected time for the kth round to take place is D ∼ q T k (a) , where T k (a) = a k (n − k − 1);\nProof: For 1), we need to analyse the probability the next matrix satisﬁes (3) and (4). Since there is only a roughly 1/q chance that (3) is 0, the probability is dominated by (4). The ﬁrst k interference vectors span a subspace of size about q k , where the entire space is of size about q n−1 , so the probability of (4) is about q −(n−k−1) . Since this must occur for a k users in step k, the probability is q −a k (n−k−1) to ﬁrst order terms, and the result follows. Full details in [8].\nFor 2), note that for large q, the delay is dominated by the slowest step of the scheme.\nBeamforming slightly improves the performance of JAP(a) schemes, combining ideas from the original Cadambe\u2013Jafar interference alignment [1] with the JAP scheme.\nIn round k we can guarantee that the interference matches up for receiver l := A k−1 + 1. Each transmitter i, instead of repeating their message w i , rather encodes (H li [t k ]) −1 H li [t 0 ]w i . (Since the coefﬁcient H li cannot be 0, the inverse term certainly exists.) The total received inter- ferences at receiver l at times t 0 and t k are both equal to\nWe refer to such schemes that take advantage of beamform- ing as JAP-B(a) schemes.\nTheorem 4: The delay exponent of a JAP-B(a) scheme with parameter sequence a is\nProof: At each round, receiver A k−1 + 1 will automat- ically recover its message, leaving the JAP scheme to align interference for the other a k − 1 users.\nIn particular, the JAP-B scheme will always outperform the JAP scheme with the same sequence a.\nAn interesting special case of the JAP-B schemes is the case when K = 1 and a 1 = n; we call this scheme JAP-B(n).\nIn this case, we have 1/(K + 1) = 1/2 degrees of freedom for a rate of D(Z)/2. From Theorem 4, we see that the delay exponent is\nEffectively, the JAP-B(n) scheme works by using beam- forming to automatically cancel user 1\u2019s interference, then for users 2, 3, . . . , n requiring the existence of diagonal matrices D 0 , D 1 such that D 0 H[t 0 ] + D 1 H[t 1 ] = I.\nNote that this is the same rate as is achieved by the original NGJV scheme, but the delay exponent has been reduced from\nNGJV\u2019s n 2 to (n − 1)(n − 2) = n 2 − (3n − 2). For small n in particular this is a worthwhile improvement (see Figure 1). For n = 3 users, where experiments have shown the feasibility of interference alignment [10], the delay exponent is reduced from n 2 = 9 to (n − 1)(n − 2) = 2.\nAnother way to generate new alignment schemes is by time- sharing schemes designed for a smaller number of users.\nCall the NGJV, KWG, JAP and JAP-B schemes \u2018parent schemes\u2019. Given a parent scheme for an m-user network, we can modify the scheme for use in an n-user network for n > m, giving what we call a \u2018child scheme\u2019.\nWe use TDMA to split an n-user network into n m sub- networks, each of which contains a unique collection of just m < n of the users. Within each of these m-user subnetworks, an m-user parent scheme is used, while the other n − m transmitters remain silent.\nAn m-user child scheme has the same delay exponent as the n-user parent scheme, with the rate, and thus the degrees of freedom, reduced by a factor of m/n. So an m-user JAP-B scheme shared between n users gives DOF = m/n(K + 1).\nIn particular, a child scheme from parent NGJV schemes has a lower delay exponent m 2 < n 2 than the main NGJV scheme, reducing the degrees of freedom from 1/2 to m/2n. As even this outperforms the KWG schemes, we regard this as the benchmark against which to compare our new JAP-B parent and child schemes.\nChild schemes derived from the JAP-B(n) parent scheme are particularly effective, and usually perform better than other JAP-B schemes, as we discuss in the next section.\nGiven a number of users n and a desired number of degrees of freedom DOF = 1/(K + 1), we wish to ﬁnd a scheme with the lowest delay exponent.\nFor K = n − 1 or n, when DOF = 1/n or 1/(n + 1), the best JAP-B schemes have delay exponent 0. This is the same delay exponent as TDMA, which has DOF = 1/n also.\nFor K ≤ n − 2 the best parent scheme will be a JAP- B scheme with parameter sequence a ∈ A(n, K). We write T (n, K) for this best delay exponent, that is\nTheorem 5: Fix n and K ≤ n − 2. For T (n, K) as deﬁned above, we have the following bounds:\nK (n − 2). The gap between the bounds grows linearly with n.\nProof: The bounds are straightforward from considering the relaxed minimisation problem, where the a k are allowed to be any positive real number. Full details in [8].\nFor small values of n, we can ﬁnd the best parent JAP- B schemes by hand. (The task is simpliﬁed by noting that the optimal a k will be nonzero and increasing in k.) Table I gives the delay exponents of the best JAP-B schemes for n = 3, . . . , 7 and K ≤ n − 2.\nWe also consider child schemes based on parent JAP-B schemes. Figure 1 plots the performance of NGJV and all JAP-B schemes, as well as child schemes derived from them, for n = 3, . . . , 7. For many values of n and DOF, the scheme with the lowest delay exponent is JAP-B(n) or a child scheme derived from it, although the JAP-B parent schemes with (n, K) = (5, 2) or (8, 2), for example, and their child schemes always outperform JAP(n) for some degrees of freedom.\nWe now consider the performance of schemes in the many- user limit n → ∞. We consider two limiting regimes, depending on how the degrees of freedom DOF(n) should scale with the number of users n.\n\u2022 Regime I, where we hold DOF(n) = α constant, for α ∈ (0, 1/2]. That is, we want to communicate at ﬁxed fraction of the single-user rate, as in the NGJV scheme. NGJV itself corresponds to α = 1/2.\n\u2022 Regime II, where we hold the sum-rate constant, so the DOF(n) = β/n, for β ≥ 1. That is, we want to communicate at a multiple of the rate allowed by resource division schemes like TDMA. TDMA itself corresponds to β = 1.\nTheorem 6: Let T (n) be the delay exponent of the best parent JAP-B(a) scheme for n-users with at least DOF(n) degrees of freedom. Then:\n\u2022 Regime I: Fix α ∈ (0, 1/2]. Then the delay exponent for DOF(n) = α scales quadratically, in that\n\u2022 Regime II: Fix β > 1. Then the delay exponent for DOF(n) = β/n scales linearly, in that T (n) = O(n), or more speciﬁcally\nβ + 1 β\nProof: The result follows taking K = 1/α −1 in regime I, or K = n/β − 1 in regime II. Full details in [8].\nFigure 1 shows that sharing the parent scheme JAP-B(m) is particularly effective. The following theorem shows this.\nTheorem 7: Let T (n) be the delay exponent of child schemes based on JAP-B(m) parent schemes for n-users with at least DOF(n) degrees of freedom Then:\n\u2022 Regime I: Fix α ∈ (0, 1/2]. Then the delay exponent for DOF(n) = α scales quadratically, in that\n\u2022 Regime II: Fix β > 1. Then the delay exponent for DOF(n) = β/n is constant, in that\nProof: The result follows taking m = 2αn in regime I, or m = 2β in regime II. Full details in [8].\nNote that asymptotically this means that in both regimes child schemes from JAP-B(m) parent schemes are asymptot- ically more effective than any other parent scheme.\nNote also that by the same argument as above, sharing the NGJV parent scheme gives T (n) = 4α 2 n 2 in regime I \u2013 less good than sharing JAP-B(m), but the same to ﬁrst-order terms.\nM.
