This paper analyzes the diversity of zero-forcing MIMO SC-FDE. It is shown that the diversity of the ZF receiver over this channel is the same as that of the ZF receiver in the frequency-ﬂat channel. To improve the performance, a lattice-reduction (LR) aided ZF equalization is proposed and analyzed.

This is the ﬁrst analytical proof for the LR-aided equalization for MIMO frequency selective channel."},"body":{"text":"Single carrier frequency domain equalizer (SC-FDE) is a linear receiver with distinct advantages [1] that also has been adopted in the 3GPP LTE standard. Recently [2], [3] it was discovered that this receiver exhibits a surprising rate- dependent diversity under MMSE SISO and SIMO scenarios. Its behavior under zero-forcing MIMO conditions has been hitherto unknown. This paper seeks to characterize the diver- sity of zero-forcing (ZF) SC-FDE MIMO equalization. We are interested to know not only the value of diversity, but also whether the diversity of the ZF receiver a function of the rate and channel memory? We also investigate whether the LR- aided ZF or MMSE equalizers achieve full diversity for all rates.\nThe results of this paper show that the ZF SC-FDE diversity is largely suboptimal even with outer coding. In fact, the diversity of the ZF SC-FDE in the frequency selective channel is the same as in a frequency ﬂat channel. Motivated to improve the system performance, we investigate a lattice reduction (LR) aided equalization which has been recently proposed for the frequency ﬂat MIMO channel. This paper contributes the ﬁrst analysis of LR-aided linear receiver in the context of frequency selective MIMO channels, which is a signiﬁcant departure from the frequency-ﬂat analysis [4].\nWe ﬁrst provide a short literature survey. The distribution of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the linear MIMO receiver is generally unknown except in asymptote of large number of antennas, and high/low SNR [5], [6]. Since the system analysis depends on this distribution, the exact performance remains unknown in many cases. Outage and diversity analysis have also been a subject of interest. Gore et al. [7] studies the performance of MMSE D-BLAST as well as the ordered successive cancellation V-BLAST. Onggosanusi et al. [8] study MMSE and zero-forcing (ZF) MIMO receivers.\nHedayat and Nosratinia [9] consider the outage probability as a function of ﬁxed rates R under joint and separate spatial encoding for ZF and MMSE receivers. Kumar et al. [10] provide a DMT analysis for the system of [9]. Hesham et al. characterize the diversity of MMSE receiver as function of rate (b/s/Hz) and the number of antennas in both frequency ﬂat and frequency selective channel [11], [3].\nTo reduce the gap between the performances of linear receivers and the maximum likelihood receiver, the lattice reduction technique has been recently proposed. Lattice re- duction [12], [13] aims to ﬁnd a better representation of the channel matrix that has nearly orthogonal columns vectors, thus the noise enhancement problem inherent in channel inversion is reduced. It has been shown through simulations (and analytical results for some cases) that the diversity order of LR-aided receiver is the same as maximum likelihood. In this paper we adopt the complex Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (CLLL) algorithms [14] and analytically obtain the diversity order of LR-aided ZF over frequency selective MIMO channel under cyclic-preﬁx transmission.\nConsider a quasi-static MIMO channel where the channel impulse response remains unchanged during a transmission block. We assume a multipath intersymbol interference chan- nel (ISI) channel model. The channel impulse response be- tween the transmit antenna m and receive antenna n is denoted by the vector h mn = [h mn, 0 , h mn, 1 , . . . , h mn,ν ], where ν is the channel memory. Assuming M transmit and N receive antennas with N M , the received vector y k at time instant k is given by [15], [2]\nwhere H i is the M × N channel matrix that has h mn,i as its (m, n) element, x k −i is M × 1 transmitted vector at time index k − i, y k is the N × 1 received vector and n k is the the N × 1 Gaussian noise vector at time index k.\nConsider a transmission of L d + L e spatial vectors each of size M × 1, where L d and L e are the number of data vector blocks and the number of data-extension blocks, respectively. The ﬁrst L e vectors are discarded at the receiver [15]. The model can be written as\nwhere ¯ y is the L d N × 1 received vector, ¯ x is the M (L d + L e )×1 transmitted vector, ¯ n is the white Gaussian noise vector ∈ C N L d ×1 and ¯ H is the channel matrix given by\n   \nH 0 H 1 · · · H ν 0 · · · 0 0 H 0 H 1 · · · H ν · · · 0\n   \nLet ¯ x = U cp ˆ x where U cp denotes the cyclic preﬁx matrix. , i.e.,\nwhere H e = ¯ HU cp is an N L d × M L d block circu- lant matrix constructed by block circulations of the matrix [H 0 , H 1 , . . . , H ν , 0, . . . , 0] T .\nAssuming perfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR), the ZF equalizer W is applied to decouple the received streams after removing the ﬁrst L e vectors. Applying the SC-FDE .The ZF equalizer and the unbiased decision-point SINR of its output are respectively given by [16], [17] 1 :\n(H e H H e ) −1 kk \t k = 1, . . . , M L d \t (7) where ρ is the per-stream SNR. We are also going to use the following outage-type quantities [2]\nDiversity analysis usually requires the analysis of the error probability. We shall perform outage analysis as the ﬁrst step towards deriving the diversity function. Lower and upper bounds on error probability via outage probabilities follow similarly to [11], [2]. This two-step approach was ﬁrst pro- posed in [18] due to the intractability of the direct error analysis for many MIMO architectures.\nWe also denote the exponential equality of two functions f (ρ) and g(ρ) as f (p) . = g(p) when lim ρ →∞ log f (ρ) log(ρ) = lim ρ →∞ log g(ρ) log(ρ) The operators ˙ and ˙ can be similarly de- ﬁned.\nThe N L d × M L d block-circulant matrix H e has eigen decomposition H e = Q H Rx ΛQ T x , where Q T x and Q Rx are the augmented DFT matrices given by Q T x = Q ⊗ I M and Q Rx = Q ⊗ I N , respectively. I M is the identity matrix of size\nM , Q is the L d × L d normalized DFT matrix, and ⊗ is the Kroenecker product. The matrices Q T x and Q Rx are unitary and Λ is a block diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are {B k } matrices. The matrix B k is given by [19]\nThe ZF SC-FDE is applied to the received vector in (5). The effective mutual information between ˆ x and the equalized received signal ˜ y \t W ¯ y is equal to the sum of mutual information of their components [8], [2]\n(10) . = P M log M L d\nThe bound in (10) is obtained using the Specht bound with Specht constant M β [20], [11] (Please refer to Lemma 3 in Appendix A). The exponential equality (11) follows in a similar manner to [11, Section III-B].\nwhere λ k,i is the k-th eigenvalue of the i-th Wishart matrix B i H B i and λ min,1 is the minimum eigenvalue of B 1 H B 1 . Equation (14) follows from the distribution of λ min,1 [10], [21] 2 . The diversity obtained in (14) is the same as the\ndiversity of ZF receiver in the frequency ﬂat channel [9] demonstrating that the bound in (14) is achievable. We thus conclude that the bound in (14) is tight, i.e\nRemark 1: It is clear that the ZF receiver is largely subop- timal compared to the MMSE receiver whose diversity is a function of the spectral efﬁciency R (b/s/Hz) and was shown to achieve full diversity at low rates [3].\nThe noise enhancement problem in the ZF equalization can be reduced if the channel H e is close to orthogonal. One way to approximately orthogonalize the channel matrix before equalization is Lattice reduction (LR) [12], [13].\nAmong different lattice reduction methods, the LLL reduc- tion (or its complex version CLLL) algorithm (see, e.g. [22] and the references therein) is widely used. The LLL algorithm has a running time that is polynomial in the dimension of the lattice and is therefore considered a candidate for the practical applications. The orthogonality of a matrix H r can be quantiﬁed using the orthogonality defect deﬁned in [23]\ndet H H r H r \t (16) where H r = [b 1 . . . b M L d ]. Moreover, the orthogonality defect can be bounded as [23]\nApplying CLLL algorithm [22] to H e , we obtain H r = H e T, where T is a unimodular matrix (whose entries and the entries of its inverse T −1 are complex integers and det (T) = ±1 or ±j), and det(·) denotes the determinant. Applying the ZF equalizer for the reduced channel H r , an estimate for x is\nˆ x = T −1 x + W ZF n = z + ˜ n \t (18) Notice that the entries of T −1 x are complex integers. Thus we can estimate z from ˆ x in (18) by rounding up to integers and the vector x is recovered by mapping Tz to the appropriate constellation.\nOutage occurs if the channel fails to support the target rate [21]. After equalization, the L d symbols are decoupled and thus the effective mutual information between the transmitted vector ˆ x and the equalized received vector ˜ y given CSIR is given as [2], [9]\n(19) Using LR-aided ZF equalizer, the outage probability is\nwhere H r is the M L d ×M L d reduced channel that is invertible almost surely and a k denotes the column of (H −1 r ) H . We now use a result from [23].\nLemma 1: [23] Let H r = [b 1 . . . b L ] be an M L d × M L d matrix with orthogonality defect δ given by (16) and H −H r = [a 1 . . . a M L d ] be the hermitian of H −1 r . We have ||b k || √\n(23) where we substitute with (16) to obtain (22) and use (17) to obtain (23). Let {λ k } be the eigenvalues of H e ,\nwhere we have used det (T) = ±1 or ±j. Thus (23) can be written as\n(25) where (25) holds since M, L d , c and R are constants with respect to ρ. We now use the following lemma.\nLemma 2: Let {b k } be a set of positive random variables and q be a positive integer, we have\nwhere h i,j is the entry number (i, j) of the matrix H e . Since H e is circulant then it can be easily veriﬁed that\nSince the parameter { m,n,k |h mn,k | 2 } is a chi-square random variable with 2M N (ν + 1) degree of freedom then evaluating (29) results in [18], [9]\nP out ˙ ρ −MN(ν+1) . \t (31) Since the diversity obtained in (31) is the maximum channel diversity achieved by an optimum ML receiver, we conclude that the LR-aided ZF diversity is d LR out = M N (ν + 1).\nRemark 2: We note that similar proof can be obtained for the MMSE case.\nRemark 3: The number of LLL iterations, denoted by N , required to perform LR for a given generator matrix D ∈ R n ×n is [24]\nThe lower bound on PEP is based on Fano\u2019s inequality as in [18] with a careful treatment for the system model given in Section II similar to [2]. Thus We have P err ˙ P out .\nThe upper bound on PEP for the ZF receiver is developed using the union bound on error. Let O and E denote outage and error events respectively. The PEP is given by\nWe use an approach similar to [2]. The authors in [2] have shown that P err ˙ P out for the SISO SC-FDE equalizer by demonstrating that the probability P (E, ¯ O ) in (32) can be bounded as (using the union bound)\nwhere l is the codeword length, σ 2 ˜ n (k) is the variance of the k- th output ﬁltered noise ˜ n 3 and d max is the maximum channel diversity. The proof of [2] does not depend on the codeword length for both upper and lower PEP bounds. The length was set to one for simplicity. It can be shown that a similar proof holds for the LR-aided ZF MIMO receiver. We omit the proof for thespace limitation.\nWe provide Monte Carlo simulations for i.i.d Rayleigh fading channel. Figure 1 shows the outage probability of the SIMO frequency-selective channel with the following parameters: M = 1, N = 2, ν = 1 and R = 2 b/s/Hz. The diversity of the SC ZF-FDE is N − M + 1 = 2 whereas the LR-aided ZF equalizer achieves the full diversity. Figure 2 shows the case of MIMO channel with M = N = 2, ν = 1 and R = 2 b/s/Hz. while the LR-aided ZF receiver achieves the maximum diversity, the diversity of the SC ZF-FDE is 1.\nWe analyze the single-carrier frequency domain zero- forcing (ZF) equalizer operating in frequency selective N ×M MIMO channel (where M and N M are the number of transmit and receive antennas respectively). We show that the diversity is the same as the diversity of the frequency-ﬂat channel, which is N − M + 1. To improve the performance, we propose a lattice reduction (LR) aided ZF equalizer. We show that the LR-aided ZF achieves the full channel diversity N M (ν + 1) where ν is the channel memory.\nLemma 3: (The Specht Bound) [20] Let x i ∈ [L 1 , L 2 ] with 0 < L 1 < L 2 and i = 1, . . . , n. We have n x i 1 n x i\nand M 1 = 1, in which β L 2 L 1 1 with Specht constant M β .\nWe now proceed to the proof of Lemma 2. We start with the right-hand side of (26)\nWe now condition on the event β a = (qM β ) q a where a > 1 is an arbitrary ﬁxed parameter. We have\nwhere (35) follows since P (β a ) and (a) q are independent of ρ."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"F. Pancaldi"},{"name":"G. Vitetta"},{"name":"R. Kalbasi"},{"name":"N. Al-Dhahir"},{"name":"M.
