As the demand for high-speed communication increases, M-ary PSK with M > 2 is becoming attractive in optical communi- cation, despite the increased system complexity, because it provides an increase in the number of bits per transmitted symbol without increasing the frequency bandwidth [2]. In the quantum version of PSK, one or more optical modes prepared in a predetermined quantum state is the analog of the classical waveform to which information-bearing phase shifts are applied. Unlike the classical case in which the signal constellation is contained in a two-dimensional space, the quantum version opens up the possibility of optimization of the state that is subject to modulation.\nTheoretical studies by Kato et al. [3], building on the work of Helstrom [4] and Ban et al. [5], have demonstrated an appreciable gap between the M-PSK performance using the optimum quantum measurements and that using standard heterodyne detection on coherent states from standard laser sources. The study of modulation state optimization under an energy constraint was pioneered by Hall and Fuss in [6], although these authors studied only the single-mode case under a certain restriction on the allowed POVM measure- ments [7]. They also pointed out that, given sufﬁcient energy, communication with zero error probability is possible when this restriction is relaxed. Shapiro [8] demonstrated zero- error communication under a modiﬁed two-mode modulation format. However, the optimal modulation state under an energy\nconstraint without any restrictions on the choice of modulation state or on the allowed POVM measurements appears not to have been obtained prior to this work.\nIf the sender and receiver in the communication framework described above are co-located, but the phase shift is applied at a different location, we obtain a model for a phase de- tection problem, an instance of quantum metrology, in which probe state optimizations are often carried out [9]. Another application is to the recently developed concept of quantum reading of a classical digital memory [10]\u2013[13] using quantum states of light. The original proposal [10] considered the use of a quantum transmitter state that reads a standard optically encoded digital memory such as a CD or DVD with a bit error probability better than that achievable with standard laser sources. In [12], a phase-encoded memory, which has the advantage that it can be lossless in principle, was proposed, along with a probe state for reading it without error. This memory encodes a bit 0 (1) as a 0 (⇡) rad phase shift imparted to a probe beam on reﬂection from the encoding surface. As such, it corresponds exactly to the M = 2 case of the problem considered here.\nOnce the modulation state is chosen, the M-ary PSK problem falls under the general rubric of distinguishing a symmetric set of quantum states that has been extensively studied in quantum decision theory [4], [5], [14], [15]. The optimal quantum measurement for a given pure modulation state was obtained in the pioneering works [4], [5], [14]. This optimal measurement, called variously as the Square- Root Measurement (SRM), Least-Squares Measurement, and Pretty Good Measurement, has many interesting properties and has also been applied to quantum information theory [15].\nIn this paper, our concern is rather the design problem of choosing the best (i.e., yielding the least error probability) transmitter state under a given energy constraint, a problem that has not yet been addressed in full generality in the literature. Thus, we obtain the best modulation state optimized over all quantum states, pure and mixed, and of any number of signal and ancilla modes under an average energy constraint. Our results are based on the existence of a simple function of the multimode transmitter state that sufﬁces to determine the error performance. This function clariﬁes the role of multiple signal and ancilla modes in the transmitter state and, together with the known form of the minimum error probability for discriminating a symmetric set of states, enables ﬁnding the\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section I, we set up the mathematical model of the M-ary PSK problem. In Sec- tions II.A and II.B, we ﬁnd the optimum pure-state transmitter under signal and combined energy constraints respectively. The result that mixed-state transmitters do not improve matters under either constraint is proved in Section II.C. Concluding remarks are made in Section III.\nConsider, for M 2 , for ✓ M = 2⇡/M , and for Z M = {0, . . . , M 1 }, the set {m ✓ M : m 2 Z M } of phase shifts on the unit circle. The action of the m-th such phase shift to each of J 1 optical ﬁeld modes (with annihilation operators {ˆa (j) S } J j=1 ) is represented by the unitary operator\nwhere ˆ N (j) S = ˆ a (j) \u2020 S ˆ a (j) S is the number operator of the j-th mode, with 1  j  J. These modes that suffer the phase shift are called signal modes, indicated by the subscript \u2018S\u2019 (see Fig. 1). In addition to the J signal modes, we also allow, as depicted in Fig. 1, any number J 0 0 of ancilla modes. These are indicated by the subscript \u2018A\u2019, and have annihilation operators {ˆa (j 0 ) A } J 0 j 0 =1 . The ancilla modes do not acquire the m -dependent phase shift, but allow for the preparation of a quantum state that is entangled across the signal and ancilla modes. Such a joint state on the signal and ancilla modes will be called a transmitter state, or simply, transmitter.\nAn arbitrary pure transmitter state of J + J 0 modes may be written in the multimode number basis as\nwhere |ki A = |k 1 i ⌦ · · · ⌦ |k J 0 i and |ni S = |n 1 i ⌦ · · · ⌦ |n J i are multimode Fock states. For any such transmitter state, the output states for the ancilla and return (\u2018R\u2019) modes are\nwhere ˆ I A is the identity transformation on the ancilla modes. If m is drawn with uniform a priori probability from Z M , the output states of Eq. (3) satisfy the symmetric set condition [5] deﬁned by\n|  m i = ˆ V m | i, m 2 Z M , \t (4) ˆ V M = ˆ I, \t (5)\nwhere | i in (4) corresponds to the transmitter of (2) and the unitary operator ˆ V above is given by\nWe are interested in minimizing the error probability over a set of allowed pure transmitters | i AS . This entails two suc- cessive minimizations. For a chosen transmitter state | i AS , the minimum error probability achievable is given by\n, (7) where the optimization is over all POVM\u2019s { ˆ E m } M 1 m=0 . We further optimize P e over transmitters that satisfy an inequality constraint on the average total energy in the signal modes, namely,\nN S being a given number. For brevity, we simply write \u2018signal energy\u2019 for the average total energy in the signal modes given by the left-hand side of Eq. (8).\nUsing (2), we calculate the signal energy h ˆ N S i = X\nn p n , \t (11) where p n is the probability that the total photon number n 1 + · · · + n J in the signal modes is n. We denote the signal photon probability distribution by the vector p = (p 0 , p 1 , . . .) . Another discrete probability distribution derived from the transmitter state plays a key role in our treatment. For a given M and transmitter state, and for ⌫ 2 Z M , let p ⌘ (p 0 , . . . , p ⌫ , . . . , p M 1 ) be deﬁned component-wise as\nIn other words, p is the probability distribution induced by p on the modulo-M congruence classes of the total signal photon number.\nNote that the case of a combined energy constraint is postponed to Section II.B and that of mixed-state transmitters under either constraint to Section II.C.\nWe ﬁrst present the basic result that, without invoking an energy constraint or specifying J and J 0 , we can partition the transmitter state space into equivalence classes of states having the same error probability.\nTheorem 1. Pure transmitters with the same p have the same error performance in M-ary PSK. This statement encompasses transmitters with differing J and/or J 0 .\nProof: For an arbitrary transmitter state | i AS written in the form of Eq. (2), the corresponding output states {|  m i AR } M 1 m=0 are given by\nConsider the M ⇥ M matrix G (the Gram matrix) whose elements are all the mutual inner products between the {  m }, i.e.,\nG mm 0 := AR h  m |  m 0 i AR . \t (14) The minimum error probability (7) in discriminating the set of pure states {|  m i AR } M 1 m=0 is a function of the elements of G alone [16]. The elements of G are given by\nG mm 0 = AR h  m |  m 0 i AR \t (15) =\nThe equality (18) follows because, for any m and m 0 , the exponential factor is periodic in n with period M. Thus the Gram matrix, and hence the error performance, is a function of just the M components of p, and this is true irrespective of the values of J and J 0 .\nOur next result applies Theorem 1 to obtain a simple form of the optimal transmitter state when the signal energy is con- strained. It also presents a state which enables communication without error.\nTheorem 2. (a) For N S < (M 1)/2 , a single-mode trans- mitter state of the form | i S = P M 1 ⌫=0 p p ⌫ |⌫i S with p ⌫ 0 achieves the minimum error probability.\n(b) For N S (M 1)/2 , the uniform superposition state | i S = 1 p M ( |0i S + · · · + |M 1 i S ) achieves zero error probability.\nProof: (a) Presented with any transmitter state | i AS with associated p and p, we can construct the single-mode transmitter\nThis state has the same p, so by Theorem 1 it has the same performance as | i AS . Moreover, because the probabilities p n that | i AS associates with n M all contribute to photon numbers less than M in | i S , the signal energy in (19), as given by Eq. (11), is not greater than that of the original transmitter state. Thus, (19) provides the same performance at equal or lesser signal energy than any state with the same p.\n(b) If N S \t (M 1)/2 , consider the transmitter state\nwhich has energy (M 1)/2 and is therefore allowed by the energy constraint. From (18), we see that G mm 0 = m,m 0 so that the output states are mutually orthogonal and the error probability is zero.\nIt is remarkable that neither multiple signal modes nor ancillary entanglement is necessary for optimum performance. This is in contrast to the typical situation in ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space where distinguishing two unitary operators ben- eﬁts from multiple applications of the unitaries [17] or where entanglement with an ancilla helps in distinguishing more than two unitary operators [18]. The zero-error property of the state of Theorem 2 (b) was noted in [6], although this or any other single-mode state cannot achieve error-free communication under the restricted class of measurements allowed in [6].\nThe next result gives the form of the coefﬁcients of the optimal transmitter state for a signal energy constraint N S < (M 1)/2 and also shows that any transmitter state achieving zero-error must have signal energy at least (M 1)/2 .\nTheorem 3. (a) Among all transmitter states satisfying h ˆ N S i  N S < (M 1)/2 , the minimum error probability is achieved by a state of the form (19) with p given by\nwhere A, B are positive constants chosen to satisfy the constraints\n(b) Any transmitter state achieving zero-error discrimination must have p = (1/M, . . . , 1/M) and signal energy greater than or equal to (M 1)/2 .\nProof: (a) By Theorem 2 (a), it sufﬁces to consider a single-mode transmitter state of the form (19). Recall from Section I that the states {|  m i AR } M 1 0 form a symmetric set. It was shown in [4], [5], [14] that the SRM is the minimum error probability measurement for any symmetric pure state set. Its error probability is given by [3]\nwhere = ( 0 , . . . , M 1 ) is an ordered vector of eigenval- ues of the Gram matrix G as speciﬁed by the formula (cf. Eq. (42) of [3])\nG 0m e im 0 m✓ M , \t (24) which is equivalent to\nwhere F is the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on Z M and G 0 ⌘ {G 0m } is the ﬁrst row of the Gram matrix. On the other hand, (18) implies that\n= M p, \t (27) which gives a physical interpretation for . Minimizing P e for states of the form (19) and of signal energy exactly N S is then equivalent to maximizing the concave function P\np ⌫ = 1 and P M 1 ⌫=0 ⌫ p ⌫ = N S are satisﬁed. Using Lagrange multipliers, we ﬁnd the stationary point\n⌫ p ⌫ = N S . The point p deﬁned by (28) is an interior point of the domain of optimization and a local maximum. Since the function being maximized is concave, it is also a global maximum on the domain. Thus, the transmitter state (28) achieves the minimum error probability with energy exactly N S . Lemma 1, below, establishes that the state (28) is also optimal under the inequality constraint (8).\np M . It is easy to verify that the maximum value of the quantity P M 1 ⌫=0 p p ⌫ under just the constraint P\n⌫  M 1 . Thus, the states providing zero-error discrimina- tion are exactly those with uniform p. Such a state has signal energy at least (M 1)/2 .\nLemma 1. The optimum transmitter state under the inequality constraint h ˆ N S i  N S < (M 1)/2 is the same as the optimum state under the equality constraint h ˆ N S i = N S , i.e., the state of Theorem 3.\nProof: The maximum of P M 1 ⌫=0 p p ⌫ under just the probability constraint P M 1 ⌫=0 p ⌫ = 1 is achieved at p ⇤ = (1/M, . . . , 1/M ) . Denote the p of an optimal state under the inequality constraint by p ⇤ , and its signal energy by N s  N S . Consider the line segment L joining p ⇤ to p ⇤ . Since the signal energy is a linear in p, L contains states of signal energy ranging from N s to (M 1)/2 . Further, since the function P\nis a concave function of p whose maximum is attained at p ⇤ , the function must be nondecreasing as we move\nalong L from p ⇤ to p ⇤ . In particular, we can ﬁnd a state on L with signal energy N S and equal or better performance than that obtainable from p ⇤ . Consequently, there is an optimal state under the inequality constraint with signal energy exactly N S .\nThe best transmitter for 2-PSK is particularly straightfor- ward.\nCorollary 1 (Binary case). For M = 2, the optimum trans- mitter state for N S < 1/2 is\nProof: This follows immediately on solving for A and B in Theorem 3(a).\n(30) An experimental implementation of this optimum 2-PSK per- formance using single-photon sources and linear optics is proposed in [20]. For M > 2, it appears that closed-form solutions for A and B appearing in the expression (28) for the optimal state cannot be obtained, so recourse to numerical evaluation becomes necessary. Figure 2 shows the optimum error probability as a function of N S obtainable from the state (28) for various values of M. For comparison, the error probability obtainable from a coherent state transmitter is also shown.\nB. Pure-State Transmitters with a Combined Energy Con- straint\nIn contrast to the foregoing, we may wish to constrain, as a measure of the entire resources involved in state preparation, the average energy in the signal and ancilla modes combined without restricting either individually, i.e., we may impose the constraint\nD ˆ N\nfor a given number N, and ask which state satisfying this constraint minimizes the error probability. This constraint is clearly more restrictive than a signal energy constraint of N. However, we have shown in Section II.A that the optimum pure-state transmitter for a signal energy constraint of N is a signal-only state of energy N. Since this state also has combined energy N, it remains the optimum state under the combined energy constraint.\nFinally, we extend the optimality of (28) to mixed-state transmitters. We actually prove a stronger result.\nTheorem 4. Let ⇢ AS be a mixed state with ensemble decom- position ⇢ AS = P j ⇡ j |  j i AS AS h  j | and with signal energy tr(⇢ AS ˆ N S )  N or with combined energy tr(⇢ AS ˆ N )  N. A transmitter preparing the ensemble {|  j i AS } with prob- abilities {⇡\nj } and a receiver making optimal measurements conditioned on knowledge of j cannot beat the performance of the state (28) under either energy constraint.\nProof: Let P e [ ·] denote the minimum error probability attainable on using the argument as transmitter state. We have the chain of inequalities\nP e ⇥ | i S ⇤ \t (34) P e ⇥ |  opt i S ⇤ . \t (35)\nIn (32), the right-hand side represents the optimum perfor- mance under the conditions of the theorem statement and the inequality holds because the performance given by the left- hand side is obtained when knowledge of j is ignored by the receiver [21]. |  ⇤ j i S is the state of the form of (19) with the same p as |  j i AS , denoted p j , and (33) holds by Theorem 1. In (34), | i S is the state of the form (19) with p = P j ⇡ j p j , and the inequality is true because P e of (23) is a sum of convex functions of p [23], and hence convex itself. None of the state transformations above has increased the signal (or combined) energy from that of ⇢ AS , so that | i S is a pure state with energy bounded by N. By the results of Section II.A-B, it cannot beat the optimum pure state |  opt i S of (28) with energy N.\nWe have introduced a model for M-ary phase shift keying using quantum states of light and, using a simple criterion that clusters states in classes of equivalent performance, have obtained the best transmitter state optimized over all possible\nstates satisfying either of two physically relevant forms of energy constraint. From a theoretical viewpoint, we have thus completely solved a constrained channel discrimination prob- lem. From a more practical viewpoint, our results, obtained under the assumption of no loss, are likely to be useful in phase sensing and quantum reading where typical loss levels are not very high. For future work, it is highly desirable to study the performance of M-PSK in the presence of loss. Some of our conclusions, such as the inefﬁcacy of entanglement and multiple signal modes, and also the possibility of zero- error communication, are not expected to hold when loss is taken into account [19], but the material here is essential to a comprehensive analysis of a realistic lossy system.\nR.
