When one considers the regime of ﬁnite-length codewords, only few results on this tradeoff are known whose exact evaluation is usually intractable. Thus, practical expressions of fundamental communication limits are mostly given by asymptotic approximations based on the large blocklength regime [1], [2]. Similarly, when multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are considered, one often relies on large system approximations where the number of transmit and receive antennas are assumed to grow without bounds [3]. For both scenarios, it is well known that these asymptotic approximations mimic closely the system performance in the non-asymptotic regimes. Motivated by this observation, we provide in this paper an asymptotic approximation of the error performance of MIMO channels in the ﬁnite blocklength regime, based on large random matrix theory.\nOne of the fundamental quantities of interest when ex- ploring the tradeoff between achievable rate and block error probability is the information density (or the information spectrum). This quantity was used by Feinstein in [4] to derive an upper bound on the block error probability for a given coding rate in the ﬁnite blocklength regime. Since this bound is in general not amenable to simple evaluation, asymptotic considerations were made, in particular by Strassen [1] who derived a general expression for the discrete memoryless channel with unconstrained inputs. In his work, the variance of the information density [5] appears as a fundamental quantity. Nevertheless, Strassen\u2019s approach could not be generalized to channels with input constraints, such as the AWGN channel. To tackle this limitation, Hayashi [6] introduced the notion of second-order coding rate and provided an exact charac- terization of the so-called optimal average error probability\nwhen the channel inputs are coded within a vanishing set of rates around the critical rate. Similar considerations were made in [2], specialized in [7] to the AWGN fading chan- nel. Further work on the asymptotic blocklength regime via information spectrum methods comprise the general capacity formula derived in [8] based on a lower bound on the error probability provided in [9]. Alternatively, in [10], Shannon derived bounds on the limit of the scaled logarithm of the error probability, known as the exponential rate of decrease. Simpler formulas for the latter were then provided by Gallager [11] which are still difﬁcult to evaluate for practical channel models. To circumvent this issue, a Gaussian approximation of Gallager\u2019s bound with higher-order correction terms was recently obtained in [12] for the Rayleigh fast-fading MIMO channel. In [13], an explicit expression of Gallager\u2019s error exponent was derived for the block-fading MIMO channel. However, the computation of this result is quite involved.\nThe objective of this article is to investigate an input- constrained version of Feinstein\u2019s bound on the error probabil- ity [7] as well as Hayashi\u2019s optimal average error probability for the Gaussian MIMO Rayleigh fading channel in the non- ergodic regime. Although exact expressions of the optimal error probability are extremely difﬁcult to obtain in this setting, we derive a tight approximation of an upper bound on the error probability, which depends on the blocklength n, the number of transmit and receive antennas K and N , respectively, and the coding rate r n,K . More precisely, using recent results from random matrix theory, we show that, given a probability of error 0 ≤ < 1, and for n, K, and N sufﬁciently large, rates r n,K of the following form\nare achievable, 1 where β = n/K, c = N/K, and both ¯ C c (σ 2 ) and θ c,β are given by simple closed-form expressions. Alternatively, for some desired rate r n,K within O((nK) − 1 2 ) of the ergodic channel capacity, the optimal error probability P (n) e,N,K (r n,K ) is upper-bounded as\nThis bound is useful to assess the backoff from the ergodic channel capacity in the ﬁnite blocklength regime and it is characterized by only a few important system parameters. Applications arise for example in the context of MIMO ARQ block-fading channels where one is generally interested in minimizing the average data delivery delay, rather than maximizing the transmission rate.\nwhere y t ∈ C N is the channel output at time t, H ∈ C N ×K with independent CN (0, 1/K) entries is the channel transfer matrix, x t ∈ C K×1 is the channel input at time t assumed to be independent of H, and σw t ∼ CN 0, σ 2 I N is an additive noise at the receiver at time t. For later use, we deﬁne the following matrices: X = [x 1 . . . x n ] ∈ X n K , W = [w 1 . . . w n ] ∈ C N ×n , and Y = [y 1 . . . y n ] ∈ C N ×n . For α > 0, the channel inputs X must belong to the set of admissible inputs X n K which satisfy the energy constraint\nRemark 2.1: For the case of independent inputs x t ∼ CN (0, I K ), Pr{X ∈ X n K } = χ 2 2nK (2nK(1 + α))\ntends to one, where χ 2 k denotes the distribution function of a chi-square random variable with k degrees of freedom.\nThe information density i (X; YH) of the channel dP YH|X (the joint probability density function (pdf) of\nwhere dP YH denotes the pdf of (Y, H). For the case of independent inputs x t ∼ CN (0, I K ), this reads\nC N,K (σ 2 ) = 1 K\nThe information density will be exploited in this work to obtain bounds on two different deﬁnitions of error probability.\nn, K, M n,K , ϕ, φ -code for the channel model (3) consists of the following mappings:\nfor each (nK)-blocklength where n, K denote the num- ber of channel uses and transmit antennas, respectively. The transmitted symbols are X = ϕ(m) for every message m uniformly distributed over the set M (n,K) = {1, . . . , M n,K }.\nwhich produces the decoder\u2019s decision ˆ m = φ(Y, H) on the sent message m, or the error event e.\nGiven a code C n K \t n, K, M n,K , ϕ, φ , the average error probability is deﬁned as\n(7) Let supp(C n K ) denote the codebook {ϕ(1), . . . , ϕ(M n,K )}.

An upper-bound for the exact optimal error probability was provided in [2, Thm. 24] as follows.\nTheorem 1 ([2, Thm. 24], (see also Feinstein [4])): Let X be an arbitrary input to the channel dP YH|X with output Y and channel matrix H. Given an arbitrary positive integer M n,K , there exists a C n K = n, K, M n,K , ϕ, φ -code with codewords in the set X n K satisfying\nThere have been recent efforts [6], [2] to establish error probability approximations when the coding rate is within O((nK) − 1 2 ) of the ergodic capacity. In this scenario, a \u201csecond-order\u201d expression is deﬁned as follows.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Second-order approximation): We deﬁne the optimal average error probability for the second-order coding rate r as [6], [2]\nWe now provide closed-form approximations for the error probability given in the above deﬁnitions, using new asymp- totic statistics on the information density.\nThe ﬁrst result is a central limit theorem (CLT) for the information density I (n) N,K (σ 2 ) with Gaussian i.i.d. inputs x t (Part (i) is [14, Theorem 1]).\nTheorem 2 (Fluctuations of the information density): Let n, K, N → ∞, such that N K → c > 0, n K → β > 0. Then,\n−4 \t −2 \t 0 \t 2 \t 4 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\nThe optimal average error probability (9) with second-order coding rate r is upper bounded as\ntion from Corollary 1 to the second-order approxima- tion when r n,K is close to the ergodic capacity, i.e., r n,K = E[C N,K (σ 2 )] + r √\n. In this case, one can show that\nnKδ ∗ n,K → 0 while nKδ ∗ n,k → ∞. Moreover, as n, K → ∞, χ 2 2nK (2nK(1 + α)) → 1. Hence, the upper- bound on P (n) e,N,K (r n,K ) can be approximated by (2). Letting\nP (n) e,N,K (r n,K ) = and applying the inverse Q-function to both sides of (2) yields the achievable rate (1).\nIn order to validate the accuracy of Theorem 2 (ii) for ﬁnite n, N , and K, we compare in Fig. 1 the empirical histogram of √\nnK/θ c,β (I (n) N,K (σ 2 ) − ¯ C c (σ 2 )) against the standard normal distribution for N = 8, K = 4, n = 64, and σ 2 = 0.1. Even for these small system dimensions, we observe an almost perfect match between both results.\nIn Fig. 2, we then compare the error bound P (n) e,N,K (r n,K ) of Corollary 1 against a numerical evaluation of (25), both seen as functions of n for the same parameters as above. We suppose a coding rate of r n,K = 0.85×E[C N,K (σ 2 )] = 3.41 bits/s/Hz. Under this assumption, the best possible error probability is the outage probability P out = Pr{C N,K (σ 2 ) < r n,K } = 1.4 %. Surprisingly, the approximation of (25) by P (n) e,N,K (r n,K ) is\nextremely accurate, even for very small values of n. We addi- tionally provide the upper-bound of (2) in the same plot (the term o(1) being discarded). For the chosen set of parameters, the error approximation (2) is not tight and leads to an overly optimistic error bound. Further simulations, not provided here for lack of space, conﬁrm that this approximation becomes accurate as N, K, n, and r n,K increase.\nWe have studied the error probability of quasi-static MIMO Rayleigh fading channels in the ﬁnite blocklength regime. Under a large system assumption, we have derived a CLT for the information density. This result was used to compute a tight closed-form approximation of Feinstein\u2019s upper bound on the optimal error probability with input constraints and an achievable upper bound of the optimal average error probability in the second-order coding rate. Numerical results demonstrated that the Gaussian approximation is valid for very small blocklengths and realistic numbers of antennas. Some comments on relevant issues and on-going work are in order:\n\u2022 Converse to Corollary 2: Proving a converse to the opti- mal average error probability would require the derivation of a CLT of the information density for general input distributions. The proof of such a result is also related to the conjecture of Telatar on the outage-minimizing input distribution for multi-antenna fading channels, recently conﬁrmed for the MISO channel in [15].\n\u2022 Extensions to other scenarios of interest: The block- fading regime as well as tradeoffs between channel train- ing and data transmission can also be addressed within the framework proposed in this article. Moreover, CLTs for the information density with linear receive ﬁlters have been derived in an extended version of this article.\nProof sketch of Theorem 2: Part (i) is [14, Theorem 1]. For notational convenience, we drop dependencies on σ 2 . To prove part (ii), we start by deﬁning the following quantities:\n1) Asymptotic variance: With the above deﬁnitions, the variance of I (n) N,K can be expressed as\n(13) From [14, Theorem 3], it follows that\nwhere z n t = y H t HH H + σ 2 I N −1 y t − w H t w t . Conditionally on H, z n 1 , . . . , z n t are i.i.d. with zero mean and variance\n1 εϑ n\nNow, taking sequence of growing H in a well-chosen space of probability one, we know from (14) (by the Markov inequality and the Borel-Cantelli lemma) that 1 N tr (HH H + σ 2 I N ) −1 → m > 0 and, therefore, lim inf n ϑ n > 0. This implies that (εϑ n\nwhich is the Lindeberg condition. By [16, Theorem 27.2], we therefore conclude that, almost surely,\nThus, by the continuity of the complex exponential, (14), and the dominated convergence theorem, we arrive at\n(23) Thus,\nBy (21) and (22), the right-hand side of (24) tends to zero as N, K, n → ∞.
