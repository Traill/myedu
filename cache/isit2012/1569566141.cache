The con- structions are based on different types of algebraic structures, e.g. quaternion division algebras. When satisfying certain properties, these algebras provide us with codes whose structure naturally reduces the decoding complexity. The complexity can be further reduced by shortening the block length, i.e., by considering rectangular codes called less than minimum delay (LMD) codes."},"body":{"text":"The quality of wireless long distance communications can be signiﬁcantly improved by using cooperative diversity tech- niques. Cooperating relays can be positioned between the source station and the destination to aid the transmission by either amplifying and forwarding (AF) or decoding and forwarding (DF) the signal. Spatially separated terminals will allow an increment in the diversity in a distributed manner. Depending on the application, a one-hop or multi-hop trans- mission is called for. Here, we consider multi-hop distributed space-time codes employing a half-duplex NAF protocol [1], [2]. It is known [2] that the NAF protocol outperforms all other AF protocols since, as opposed to orthogonal protocols, it can keep transmitting also during the transmission of the relays. In addition, the AF protocols are less complex than the DF protocols. This type of low cost relay systems are called for in e.g. digital video broadcasting (DVB) [5].\nIn [3] and [6], Yang et al. and Hollanti et al. proposed block- diagonal space-time code constructions for the asymmetric MIMO channel with or without relays. The constructions arise from cyclic division algebras constructed over a higher degree center. A non-vanishing determinant (NVD) is then achieved by forming a block-diagonal matrix consisting of the left regular representation of the algebra and its Galois conjugates from the center to the base ﬁeld. It was also shown [4, Theorem 4] that a block-diagonal structure together with the NVD property is enough to achieve the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) of the NAF channel. Motivated by this and the urge for complexity reduction of MIMO codes in general, we impose further properties that the algebras and the constructions should satisfy in order to reduce the complexity. Our study reveals a trade-off between the coding gain and\ndecoding complexity. Related work has been carried out by, among others, Rajan et al. (see e.g. [13]). They considered fast-decodable distributed space-time codes arising from Clif- ford algebras. Our work differs from theirs in that our codes achieve the NVD property and hence the NAF DMT. The codes proposed in this paper moreover have a nice algebraic structure which makes analyzing the codes easier, and are also suitable for the parallel MIMO channel.\n\u2022 Explicit fast-decodable space-time relay codes are pro- posed.\n\u2022 All the codes have full diversity, some even NVD. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, these are the ﬁrst fast- decodable distributed space-time codes with NVD.\n\u2022 According to [4, Theorem 4], the proposed codes that have NVD achieve the optimal DMT of the NAF channel.\n\u2022 The constructions arise from quaternion or other type of algebras making it easy to determine the coding gain, complexity and other properties of the codes.\n\u2022 Although our explicit examples are for the case when the source and the relays each have only one antenna, the constructions are easily generalizable to other numbers of antennas and relays as well. The codes are also suitable for parallel MIMO channels.\n\u2022 We demonstrate a performance-complexity tradeoff re- sulting from the used method.\n\u2022 Finally, we analyze the worst-case decoding complexity of the proposed codes.\nLet us ﬁnish this introductory section by giving a couple essential deﬁnitions.\nDeﬁnition 1.1: If the code C consisting of matrices X satisﬁes\nwe say that C has the non-vanishing determinant property (NVD).\nIn case of square matrices, we simply refer to det(X) when talking about NVD.\nThere are multiple deﬁnitions of rate, but we will consis- tently use the following.\nwhere g i ∈ Z, e.g. PAM symbols. The rate R of the code is then\nNote that the commonly used rate in complex dimensions per channel use is R/2 when using the above notation.\nFor ease of notation, we only deﬁne the single-relay model, the generalization to multi-hop is straightforward. Following [4], let us denote by X i the signals transmitted from the source, and by Y r the signal received by the relay which the relay then ampliﬁes and forwards as BY r . The number of relays and the number of antennas at the source, relays and destination are denoted by N, n s , n r , n d , respectively. We assume n r is the same for all relays r = 1, . . . , N . To be realistic, we assume n s ≥ n r , since often the relays are mobile devices and hence only contain one or two antennas. The destination is observing Y 1 and Y 2 in consecutive time instances, and we have\nwhere V i , W are the additive white Gaussian noise matrices and F, H, G are the Rayleigh distributed channel matrices. The power allocation π i factors are chosen so that SN R denotes the received SNR per receive antenna at the destina- tion. We assume perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receivers, while the transmitters have none. For more details, we refer to [4].\nMaximum-likelihood decoding amounts to searching the code C for the codeword\nclosest to the received matrix Y with respect to the squared Frobenius norm || · || 2 F .\nConsider a code C of rank k, i.e., each codeword X is a linear combination k i=1 B i g i of generating matrices B 1 , . . . , B k , weighted by coefﬁcients g 1 , . . . , g k , which are PAM information symbols. The matrices B 1 , . . . , B k therefore deﬁne our code. Each n r × T matrix HB i corresponds, via vectorization, to a vector b i ∈ R 2T n r obtained by stacking the columns of HB i followed by separating the real and imaginary parts. We deﬁne the (generating) matrix\nso the vectorization of every received codeword corresponds to a real vector Bg, with g = (g 1 , . . . , g k ) \u2020 having coefﬁcients in the real alphabet S in use.\nNow ﬁnding arg min{||Y − HX|| 2 F } X∈C is equivalent to ﬁnding arg min{||y − Bg|| 2 E } g∈|S| k with respect to Euclidean norm, where y is the vectorization of the received matrix Y . The latter search is performed using a real sphere decoder [7], with the complexity of exhaustive search being |S| k , as the coefﬁcients of g run over all the values of S. Performing a QR-decomposition of B = QR, with Q \u2020 Q = I, reduces ML decoding to minimizing\nThe number and structure of zeros of the matrix R may improve the decoding complexity, formally deﬁned [9] to be the minimum number of vectors g over which the difference in (2) must be computed. When the complexity order (i.e., the exponent of |S| in decoding complexity) is less than the rank of the code, we say that the code is fast-decodable.\nThe authors of [8] establish when additional structure of the code improves the decoding complexity by supplying criteria when the zeros of R coincide with those of M , where M is a matrix capturing information about orthogonality relations of the basis elements B j :\nNext we recall the class of codes which allows groups of symbols to be decoded independently of one another.\nDeﬁnition 3.1: A space-time code of dimension K is called g-group decodable if there exists a partition of {1, . . . , K} into g nonempty subsets J 1 , . . . , J g , so that the matrix element M j,l = 0 when j, l are in disjoint subsets J i , J i .\n \n \nwhere each R i is a square upper triangular matrix. Hence, the symbols x j and x l can be decoded independently when their corresponding basis matrices B j and B l belong to dis- joint subsets of the partition of the basis of the code (induced by the partition of the indices).\nDeﬁnition 3.2: A space-time code is called conditionally g-group decodable if there exists a partition of the indices\n{1, . . . , K} of basis elements into g + 1 disjoint subsets J 1 , . . . , J g , J C such that\nIn this case, the sphere decoding complexity order is at most |J C | + max\nRemark 1: Note that a simple computation shows that the zero structure of M is stable under premultiplication of B i by a channel matrix H. In general, the same does not hold for R.\nBy the above discussion, in order to demonstrate fast- decodability (resp. g-group decodability), it sufﬁces to ﬁnd an ordering on the basis elements B i , which results in the desired zero structure of M . We proceed to do that for the proposed relay codes.\nWe demonstrate that the codes we obtain are conditionally 4-group decodable.\nA. Virtual 6 × 2 MIMO channel with N = 3, n s = n r = 1, n d = 2\nWe proceed to show the rate four (4 PAM symbols per channel use) relay construction consisting of 6 × 6 matrices. Fig. 1 depicts the extensions of Q involved in the next propo- sition, which we now deﬁne. Let ζ 7 denote a primitive 7 th root of unity, and deﬁne ﬁelds K = Q(\nL = K (i). Note that K = K(ζ 7 + ζ −1 7 ). Deﬁne Galois automorphisms σ : i → −i, which generates Gal(L /K ), and τ : ζ 7 → ζ 2 7 in Gal(L /Q(i)).\n \nX \t 0 \t 0 0 τ (X) \t 0\n \n√ 11σ(d) √\nwith c, d algebraic integers of L and τ acting on the elements of the matrix X point-wise.\nThen the code C has rank 24 and (real) decoding complexity |S| 15 . The code has the NVD property and hence is DMT- optimal.\nProof: We ﬁrst establish the complexity claim. Consider the generalized quaternion algebra Q = (−1, −11) K . Ma- trices X can be viewed as elements of Q via left regular representation, followed by conjugation by a suitable matrix. Conjugation by a matrix preserves the algebra structure and does not affect the determinant, but can aid energy balance and decoding complexity. The (conjugated) algebra Q has a K -basis:\n√ 11i √\n√ 11 √\n−7Γ k−4,j | k = 5, . . . , 8. Now a Z-basis of our code C can be given by\nand is of size 24. Indeed, the rank of C is 24, since each codeword X encodes 2 symbols from L , or equivalently 24 real symbols.\nWe proceed to show that C is conditionally 4-group decod- able with complexity |S| 15 ; conditioned on decoding symbols corresponding to {Γ 5,1 , . . . , Γ 8,3 }, the complexity of decoding symbols corresponding to {Γ 1,1 , . . . , Γ 4,3 } is at most |S| 3 , where S is the underlying alphabet. For that, note that when A = Γ k,j , B = Γ k ,j , for all j, j and for 1 ≤ k = k ≤ 4, we have\nLet Γ = {α τ (Γ 1,1 ), . . . , α τ (Γ 8,3 )} be the set of 24 generators of C from (5) in lexicographical order. Then the matrix M from Equation (3) capturing orthogonality relations on Γ has the following structure:\nwhere each coefﬁcient of the matrix above is a 3 × 3 matrix, which is 0 when the coefﬁcient is 0. The reduction in complexity follows from Equation (4).\nFirst we establish that all nonzero matrices X are invertible. This will follow once we show that the algebra Q is division. To that end, note that (−11, −1) K ∼ = (−1, −11) K = Q, therefore it sufﬁces to demonstrate that (−11, −1) Q(ζ 7 ) is division. This follows from techniques of [14]: we apply [14, Theorem 7.1] while noting that F × 11 3 contains no element of order 4, i.e., −1 is not a square in F 11 3 , which is the residue ﬁeld of the prime 11 in Q(ζ 7 ).\nTo show that C actually has NVD, note that the determinant of each codeword α τ (X) is ﬁxed by both τ and σ, hence it is an element, in fact an algebraic integer, of Q(\nMoreover, it is nonzero whenever X is nonzero, since Q was shown to be division, and hence is bounded away from 0, being an algebraic integer in an imaginary quadratic extension of Q. Therefore the code C has NVD property.\nB. Virtual 4 × 2 MIMO channel with N = 2, n s = n r = 1, n d = 2\nWe use a similar idea as in the 6 × 6 case to construct fast- decodable rate four relay codes consisting of 4 × 4 matrices.\nProposition 4.2: For a biquadratic ﬁeld K = Q(i, √ p), let the code C consist of matrices\nAgain, each matrix X represents a conjugated element from the quaternion algebra (a, γ) K , viewed as a 2×2 matrix via left regular representation. Then for values a = 5, γ = −2, p = 31 the resulting code is a fully diverse code of rank 16. It is con- ditionally 4-group decodable with (real) decoding complexity |S| 10 . The code has NVD and is hence DMT-optimal.\nProof: We use similar techniques to the previous proof to establish that (a, γ) K is division. First we observe that the prime ideal 5Z splits completely in K. Therefore its residue ﬁeld is isomorphic to F 5 , so we see that γ = −2 is not a square modulo 5 in the integers of K. Hence using [14, Theorem 7.1], we conclude that Q = (a, γ) K is division. The generators of Γ k,j of Q over Q(i) are\nX = Γ k,j , Y = Γ k ,j , where 1 ≤ k = k ≤ 4 and j, j = 1, 2. The lexicographical ordering on the indices of the Q-basis\ngives the matrix M with the same zero structure as in Equation (6) only now each coefﬁcient is a 2×2 matrix. Hence the code is conditionally 4-group decodable with complexity |S| 10 . More precisely, conditioned on decoding symbols correspond- ing to {α τ (iΓ 1,1 ), . . . , α τ (iΓ 4,2 )}, the complexity of decoding the rest of the symbols is at most |S| 2 .\nRemark 2: Here we have concentrated on a real sphere decoding process. Note, however, that\n{α τ (Γ 1,1 ), α τ (Γ 1,2 ), . . . , α τ (Γ 4,1 ), α τ (Γ 4,2 )} is a Z(i)-basis of C. We can verify the relations\nX = Γ k,j , Y = Γ k ,j , where 1 ≤ k = k ≤ 4. Hence the obtained code is 4-group decodable, of complexity degree 2 using a complex decoder.\nIn order to further reduce the complexity, we will shorten the block length. Such less than minimum delay codes have been considered in [10]. To this end, let us start by constructing a code with dimension rate R = 2, i.e., the lattice is of rank 4 and the code matrix transmits two real dimensions (e.g. two PAM symbols) per channel use.\nA. Virtual 4 × 1 MIMO channel with N = 2, n s = n r = 1, n d = 1\nLet ζ 8 denote a primitive 8 th root of unity. Consider the cy- clotomic extension Q(ζ 8 )/Q, with Galois group {1, τ, σ, στ }, where\nand σ : ζ 8 → ζ −1 8 is complex conjugation, also denoted by ∗ . Our code will simply consist of matrices\n  \nx \t 0 x ∗ \t 0\n  \nwhere x = a 1 + a 2 ζ 8 and a 1 , a 2 ∈ Z[i]. Due to the fact that the code matrix only contains two QAM symbols, the complexity will automatically be at most |S| 4 , where S is the underlying real alphabet.\nProposition 5.1: The matrices X \u2020 X, X = 0, have the NVD property, and hence achieve the maximum diversity min{n t , T } = 2 among the codes having the same matrix size.\nProof: The proof is straightforward. Namely, det(X \u2020 X) = 4xτ (x)x ∗ τ (x) ∗ = 4N Q(ζ 8 )/Q (x) ∈ 4Z, and hence det(X \u2020 X) ≥ 4.\nNext, we extend the above construction to the case n d = 2 ideally calling for a rate four code.\nB. Virtual 4 × 2 MIMO channel with N = 2, n s = n r = 1, n d = 2\nLet us next construct a rank-8 lattice in order to have higher multiplexing of 4 real dimensions per channel use. We start by adjoining\n5 to the above extension, i.e., we consider Q(ζ 8 ,\n5)/Q and denote the corresponding maps ﬁxing Q(i) by {1, τ :\n5, τ r}. The code matrix now looks like\n  \nνx \t 0 r(νx) \t 0\n  \n, a i ∈ Z[i], and ν = 1 + i − iθ generates a principal ideal that will make the code lattice orthogonal. This ﬁeld extension is the same as the one used for the extended golden algebra in [3]. The complexity of the code is at most |S| 8 .\nProposition 5.2: The matrices X \u2020 X, X = 0, have full rank, i.e., a code consisting of the matrices X achieves the maximum diversity min{n t , T } = 2 among the codes having the same matrix size.\nProof: Again, the proof is very simple. We have det(X \u2020 X) = (|νx| 2 + |r(νx)| 2 )(|τ (νx)| 2 + |τ r(νx)| 2 ) > 0.\nRemark 3: We want to point out that, unfortunately, there is no free lunch. Namely, with the above construction method, increasing the code rate causes a degradation in the coding gain. At the same time, reducing the delay from four to two channel uses will naturally lower the maximum rank (and diversity) the code matrix can achieve when compared to a square code matrix. Hence, we observe a performance- complexity tradeoff implying that while we can indeed reduce the decoding complexity by reducing the code length, we are likely to face worse performance caused by the reduction in diversity. Increasing the rate (performance) here will also require dropping the NVD property, again indicating a tradeoff type behavior.\nWe proposed explicit relay codes with a fast-decodable structure and NVD for different number of antennas and relays. It was shown that the method used implies a performance-complexity tradeoff. In other words, fast- decodable codes with NVD were proposed, while at the same time it was noted that relaxing on the NVD property allows for further complexity reductions. One efﬁcient way to reduce the complexity is to employ less than minimum delay codes that by construction already halve the complexity compared to general minimum delay codes. Due to lack of space here,\nit remains to be investigated how the codes perform compared to other distributed codes that either have higher complexity or lack NVD. Extended results [15] will be posted to arXiv in the near future.\nThe research of C.
