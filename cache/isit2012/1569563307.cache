The main idea of [1] is to combine the bits of the source sequence using repeated application of the \u201cpolarization kernel\u201d H 2 = 1 0 1 1 . The resulting linear code of length N = 2 n has the generator matrix which forms a submatrix of G N = BH ⊗n 2 , where B is a permutation matrix. The choice of the rows of G N is governed by the polarization of virtual channels for individual bits that arise in the process of channel combining and splitting. Namely, the data bits are written in the coordinates that correspond to near-perfect channels while the other bits are ﬁxed to some values known to both the transmitter and the decoder.\nA study of polar codes for channels with nonbinary input was undertaken by S¸as¸o˘glu et al. [2] and Mori and Tanaka [3]. For prime q, it sufﬁces to take the kernel H 2 , while for nonprime alphabets, the kernel is time-varying and not explicit. [2] remarks that the transmission scheme that uses the kernel H 2 with modulo-q addition for composite q does not necessarily lead to the polarization of the channels to the two extremes. The authors of [2] suggest several alternatives to the kernel H 2 that rely on randomized permutations or, in the case of q = 2 r , on multilevel schemes that implement polar coding for each of the bits of the symbol independently, combining them in the decoding procedure.\nIn this paper we study polarization for channels with input alphabet of size q = 2 r , r = 2, 3, . . . . Suppose that the channel is given by a stochastic matrix W (y|x) where x ∈ X , y ∈ Y, X = {0, 1, . . . , q − 1}, and Y is a ﬁnite alphabet. Assuming that the channel combining is performed using the kernel H 2 with addition modulo q, we establish results about the polarization of channels for individual symbols. It turns out\nthat virtual channels for the transmitted symbols converge to one of r+1 extremal conﬁgurations in which j out of r bits are transmitted near-perfectly while the remaining r − j bits carry almost no information. Moreover, the good bits are always aligned to the right of the transmitted r-block, and no other situations arise in the limit. Thus, the extremal conﬁgurations for information rates that arise as a result of polarization are easily characterized: they form an upper-triangular matrix as described in Sect. II-B.\nAnother related work is the paper by Abbe and Telatar [4]. In it, the authors observed multilevel polarization under the ( F 2 ) r addition. The main result of their paper provides a characterization of extremal points of the region of attainable rates when polar codes are used for each of the r users of a multiple-access channel. This result applies to a single- user channel, but does not lead to an easy description of the extremal conﬁgurations.\nPolarization of the kind established in this paper was also observed in a concurrent independent work by Sahebi and Pradhan [5].\nWe consider combining of the q-ary data under the action of the operator H 2 , where q = 2 r , r ≥ 2. Let W : X → Y, |X | = q be a discrete memoryless channel (DMC). The symmetric capacity of the channel W equals\nwhere the base of the logarithm is 2. Deﬁne the combined channel W 2 and the channels W − and W + by\n(y 1 , y 2 |u 1 , u 2 ), \t (2) where u 1 , u 2 , y 1 , y 2 are r-vectors and + is a modulo-q sum. This transformation can be applied recursively to the channels W − , W + resulting in four channels of the form W b 1 b 2 , b 1 , b 2 ∈ {+, −}. After n steps we obtain N = 2 n channels W (j) N , j = 1, . . . , N. For the case q = 2 it is shown in [1] that as n increases, the channels W (j) N become either almost perfect or almost completely noisy (polarize). In formal terms, for any ε > 0\nIn this paper we extend this result to the case q = 2 r , r > 1. As shown in [1], after n steps of the transformation (1)-(2)\nthe channels W (i) N : X → Y N × X i−1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ N are given by\nwhere G N = BH ⊗n 2 and B is a permutation matrix. Here we use the shorthand notation for sequences of symbols: for instance, y N 1 (y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y N ), etc.\nFor any pair of input symbols x, x ∈ X , the Bhattacharyya distance between them is\nwhere W {x,x } is the channel obtained by restricting the input alphabet of W to the subset {x, x } ⊂ X . For x = (x 1 x 2 . . . x r ) ∈ X let wt r (x) = max{i : x i = 0} and let d r (x, y) = wt r (x − y).\nIntroduce the ith average Bhattacharyya distance of the chan- nel W by\nRecall the setting of [1] for the evolution of the channel parameters. On the set Ω = {+, −} ∗ of semi-inﬁnite binary sequences deﬁne a σ-algebra F on Ω generated by the cylinder sets S(b 1 , . . . , b n ) = {ω ∈ Ω : ω 1 = b 1 , . . . , ω n = b n } for all sequences (b 1 , . . . , b n ) ∈ {+, −} n and for all n ≥ 0. Consider the probability space (Ω, F, P ), where P (S(b 1 , . . . , b n )) = 2 −n , n ≥ 0. Deﬁne a ﬁltration F 0 ⊂ F 1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ F where F 0 = {∅, Ω} and F n , n ≥ 1 is generated by the cylinder sets S(b 1 , . . . , b n ), b i ∈ {+, −}.\nLet B i , i = 1, 2, · · · be i.i.d. {+, −}-valued random vari- ables with Pr(B 1 = +) = Pr(B 1 = −) = 1/2. The random channel emerging at time n will be denoted by W B , where B = (B 1 , B 2 , · · · , B n ). Thus, P (W B = W (i) N ) = 2 −n for all i = 1, . . . , 2 n . Let W n = W B , I n = I(W B ), Z {x,x },n = Z(W B {x,x } ), Z v,n = Z v (W B ), and Z i,n = Z i (W B ). These random variables are adapted to the above ﬁltration (meaning that I n etc. are measurable w.r.t. F n for every n ≥ 1).\nIn this section we state a sequence of results that shows that q-ary polar codes based on the kernel H 2 can be used to transmit reliably over the channel W for all rates R < I(W ). The proofs for the most part are given in [6].\n(Z 1,∞ = 0, Z 2,∞ = 0, . . . , Z r−1,∞ = 0, Z r,∞ = 0) (Z 1,∞ = 1, Z 2,∞ = 0, . . . , Z r−1,∞ = 0, Z r,∞ = 0) (Z 1,∞ = 1, Z 2,∞ = 1, . . . , Z r−1,∞ = 0, Z r,∞ = 0) ..\n(Z 1,∞ = 1, Z 2,∞ = 1, . . . , Z r−1,∞ = 1, Z r,∞ = 0) (Z 1,∞ = 1, Z 2,∞ = 1, . . . , Z r−1,∞ = 1, Z r,∞ = 1).\nFor r = 1 these inequalities are proved in [1]. For r > 1 Eq. (6) is a restatement of [2, Prop. 3]. The fact that (7) holds for all r > 1 is proved in [6].\nInequalities (6)-(7) imply that if (Z 1 , . . . , Z r ) ∈ R k (ε) then |I(W )−(r−k)| ≤ δ where δ = max(k √ ε, (2 r−k −1)ε log e).\nThe following proposition is an immediate corollary of the above results.\nlim n→∞ P ({|I n − (r − k)| ≤ δ} B k,n (ε)) = 0. (c) E(|{i : Z i,∞ = 0}|) = I(W ).\nProof: The ﬁrst statement is obvious from (6)-(7). To prove the second statement we note that, with the appropriate choice of ε\nE(I ∞ ) = I(W ). Then use (a) and (b) to claim that E(|{i : Z i,∞ = 0}|) = r k=0 kP (I ∞ = k) = I(W ).\nWe can say a bit more about the nature of convergence established in this proposition. Let us ﬁx k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , r} and deﬁne the channel for the r − k rightmost bits of the transmitted symbol as follows:\nIt turns out that the channels for individual bits converge to either perfect or fully noisy channels. If the channel for bit j is perfect then the channels for all bits i, r ≥ i > j are perfect. If the channel for bit i is noisy then the channels for all bits j, 1 ≤ j < i are noisy. The total number of near-perfect bits approaches I(W ). This is made formal in the next proposition.\nProposition 3: Let Ω k = {ω : (Z 1,∞ , Z 2,∞ , . . . , Z r,∞ ) = 1 k 0 r−k }, k = 0, 1, . . . , r. For every ω ∈ Ω k\nProof: For every ω ∈ Ω k we have that I n (ω) → r − k. Combining this with the previous lemma and Proposition 2(b), we conclude that for such ω also I(W [r−k] n ) → r − k.\nThe concluding claim of this section describes the channel polarization and establishes that the total number of bits sent over almost noiseless channels approaches NI(W ).\nwhere δ > 0, then lim N→∞ π k,N = P (I ∞ = k) for all k = 0, 1, . . . , r. Consequently\nThis theorem follows directly from Theorem 1 and Proposi- tions 2 and 3. Some examples of convergence to the extremal conﬁgurations described by this theorem are given in the end of this paper.\nLet us describe a scheme of transmitting over the channel W with polar codes. Take ε > 0 and choose a sufﬁciently large n. Assume that the length of the code is N = 2 n . Proposition 1 implies that set [N], apart from a small subset, is partitioned into r + 1 subsets A k,n such that for j ∈ A k,n the vector (Z 1 (W (j) N ), Z 2 (W (j) N ), . . . , Z r (W (j) N )) ∈ R k (ε). Each\nj ∈ A k,n refers to an r-bit symbol in which r − k rightmost bits correspond to small values of Z i (W (j) N ). To transmit data over the channel, we write the data bits in these coordinates and encode them using the linear transformation G N .\nMore speciﬁcally, let us order the coordinates j ∈ [N] by the increase of the quantity r i=1 2 i−1 Z i (W (j) N ) and use these numbers to locate the subsets A k,n . We transmit data by encoding messages u N 1 = (u 1 , . . . , u N ) in which if j ∈ A k,n , k = 0, . . . , r − 1 then the symbol u j is taken from the subset of symbols of X with the ﬁrst k symbols ﬁxed and known to both the encoder and the decoder ([1] calls them frozen bits). In particular, the subset A r,n is not used to transmit data. A polar codeword is computed as x N 1 = u N 1 G N and sent over the channel.\nDecoding is performed using the \u201csuccessive cancellation\u201d procedure of [1] with the obvious constraints on the symbol values. Namely, for j = 1, . . . , N put\nwhere if j ∈ A k,n , k = 0, 1, . . . , r − 1, then the maximum is computed over the symbols x ∈ X with the ﬁxed (known) values of the ﬁrst k bits.\nThe error probability of this decoding is estimated in Sect. II-E.\nPart (a) of Theorem 1 follows straightforwardly from [1], [2]. Namely, as shown in [1, Prop. 4], I(W + ) + I(W − ) = 2I(W ). We note that the proof in [1] uses only the fact that u 1 , u 2 are recoverable from x 1 , x 2 which is true in our case. Hence the sequence I n , n ≥ 1 forms a bounded martingale. By Doob\u2019s theorem it converges a.e. in L 1 (Ω, F, P ) to a random variable I ∞ with E(I ∞ ) = I(W ).\nTo prove part (b) we show that each of the Z i,n \u2019s converges a.s. to a (0, 1) Bernoulli random variable Z i,∞ . This conver- gence occurs in a concerted way in that the limit r.v.\u2019s obey Z j,∞ ≥ Z i,∞ a.e. if j < i. This is shown by observing that for any ﬁxed i = 1, . . . , r and for all v ∈ X i , the Z v,n (W ) converge to identical copies of a Bernoulli random variable.\n1) Convergence of Z v,n , v ∈ X : In this section we outline the convergence proof of the Bhattacharyya parameters Z v,n to Bernoulli random variables. The following relations were proved in [2]: for all v ∈ X \\{0}\nZ v (W + ) = Z v (W ) 2 \t (8) Z v (W − ) ≤ 2Z v (W ) +\nThey imply the following lemma. Lemma 3: Let\nZ v (W ), j = 1, . . . , r. Then\nZ (r) max (W − ) ≤ qZ (r) max (W ) \t (11) Z (r−1) max (W − ) ≤ q 2 Z (r) max (W ) + q 2 Z (r−1) max (W ) (12)\n· · · + q 2 j Z (r−j+1) max (W ) + q 2 j Z (r−j) max (W ). (13) In particular, take j = 0. Relations (10), (11) imply that\nConvergence of this process is established in the following lemma.\nProof: (a) First let us rescale the process U n so that in the neighborhood of zero it has a drift to zero. Let β ∈ (0, 1) be such that\n2 (q β Y n − Y n ) ≤ − 1 8Y n ≤ 0.\nThis implies that the sequence Y n , n ≥ 0 forms a supermartin- gale which is bounded between 0 and 1. By the convergence theorem, Y n → Y ∞ a.e. and in L 1 (Ω, F, P ), where Y ∞ is a random variable supported on [0, 1]. This implies that EY 0 ≥ EY n ↓ EY ∞ . Further, if X 0 ∈ [0, 1/4] then (since EY 0 = EX 0 )\n(b) Now we shall prove that P (Y ∞ ∈ (δ, 1 2 −δ)) = 0 for any δ > 0. From (ii) it follows that P (X n+1 = X 2 n |F n ) ≥ 1/2, which implies that\nP (Y n+1 = Y 2 n |F n ) ≥ 1/2 on Y n < 1/2 \t (17) for all n ≥ 0. Suppose that Y ∞ takes values in (δ, 1/2 − δ) with probability α > 0. Let A n = {ω : Y n ∈ (δ, 1/2 − δ)}. Since Y n → Y ∞ a.e., the Egorov theorem implies that there is a subset of probability arbitrarily close to P (A n ) which\nthis convergence is uniform, and thus P (A n ) ≥ α/2 for all sufﬁciently large n. Therefore\nthe last step by (17). This however contradicts the almost sure convergence of Y n .\n(c) This implies that P (Y ∞ < 1/2) = P (Y n → 0) = P (U n → 0). From (16)\n1 4\nβ . \t (18) Moreover, if U 0 ≤ (1/2) 1/β then either Y n → 0 or Y n ≥ 1/2 for some n. This translates to\nP ((U n → 0) or (U n ≥ (1/2) 1/β for some n)) = 1 (19) provided that U 0 ≤ (1/2) 1/β .\n(d) Let δ > 0 be such that q( 1 2 ) 1 β < 1 − δ (depending on q this may require taking a sufﬁciently small β). Let L := [0, ( 1 4 ) 1 β ] and R := [1 − δ, 1]. Observe that the process U n cannot move from L to R without visiting C := (( 1 2 ) 1 β , 1−δ). Let σ 1 be the ﬁrst time when U n ∈ C, let η 1 be the ﬁrst time after σ 1 when U n ∈ L ∪ R, let σ 2 be the ﬁrst time after η 1 when U n ∈ C, etc., σ 1 < η 1 < σ 2 < η 2 < . . . . We shall prove that every sample path of the process eventually stays outside C, i.e., that for almost all ω there exists k = k(ω) < ∞ such that σ k (ω) = ∞.\nAssume the contrary, i.e., lim k→∞ P (σ k < ∞) = α > 0 (since P (σ k+1 < ∞) < P (σ k < ∞), this limit exists.) We have\nP (σ j = ∞; U η j ∈ L; σ j+1 = ∞) ≥ α ∞\nConsider the process U n = U σ k +n on the event σ k < ∞ (with the measure renormalized by P (σ k < ∞)). This process has the same properties (i)-(iii) as U n . Let J =\nlog 2 ( 1 β log 1−δ 1/4) , then x 2 J ∈ L for any x ∈ C. Therefore, P (U J ∈ L) ≥ 2 −J by property (ii). Now consider the process U J+n on the event U J ∈ L. This process has properties (i)- (iii), so we can use (18) to conclude that for\nuniformly in k. But then the sum in (20) is equal to inﬁnity, a contradiction.\n(e) The proof is completed by showing that the probability of U n staying in R c = [0, 1]\\R without converging to zero is zero. We know that almost all trajectories stay outside C, so suppose that the process starts in (0, (1/2) 1/β ). Then the probability that it enters L in a ﬁnite number of steps is uniformly bounded from below (this is shown similarly to (20)), so the probability that it does not go to L is zero. Next\nassume that the process starts in L, then by (19) it either goes to zero or enters C with probability one. Together with part (d) this implies that the process that starts in L converges to zero or one with probability one.\nThis lemma is proved by relating Z(V x,x ) to the Eu- clidean distance between the vectors ( V (y|x), y ∈ ˜ Y) and ( V (y|x ), y ∈ ˜ Y) and some geometric arguments [6].\nConvergence of the rv\u2019s Z v,n is established in the following lemma.\nThe ﬁrst part follows because all the Z v , v ∈ X i converge to identical copies of the same random variable. The second part holds true because Lemma 5 allows us to move from higher- weight symbols v in Z v to lower-weight symbols [6].\nNow the proof of Theorem 1(b) can be completed as follows. We obtain that Z i,∞ is a (0, 1) random variable a.e. and for all i, and if Z i,∞ = 1 then Z j,∞ = 1 for all 1 ≤ j < i. Consider the events Ψ (j) i = {ω : Z j,∞ = i}, i = 0, 1; j = 1, . . . , r. We have\nIf Z r−1,∞ = 0 then the possibilities are Z r−2,∞ = 1 or 0, up to another event of probability 0, and so on. Thus, the union of the disjoint events given by (5) holds with probability one. These arguments complete the proof.\nRemark : S¸as¸o˘glu et al. [2] note that the symbols can polarize to states that carry partial information about the trans- mission. In particular, they give an example of a quaternary- input channel W : {0, 1, 2, 3} → {0, 1} with W (0|0) =\nW (0|2) = W (1|1) = W (1|3) = 1. This channel has capacity 1 bit. Computing the channels W + and W − we ﬁnd that they are equivalent to the original channel W . The conclusion reached in [2] was that there are nonbinary channels that do not polarize under the action of H 2 .\nWe observe that the above channel corresponds to the ex- tremal conﬁguration (10) in (5) (the other two conﬁgurations arise with probability 0), and therefore is a stable point of the channel combining operation. It is possible to reach capacity by transmitting the least signiﬁcant bit of every symbol.\nThe main result in this part extends the argument of [1] to nonbinary alphabets.\nthat k |A k,N |(r − k) ≥ NR and Z v (W (i) N ) < 2 −N α for all i ∈ A k,N , all v ∈ r l=k+1 X l , and all k = 0, 1, . . . , r − 1.\nThis theorem follows upon combining Lemma 4 and a result of [7].\nThe next theorem gives an estimate of the block error rate. Theorem 4: Let 0 < α < 1/2 and let 0 < R < I(W ),\nA simple example is given by the ordered erasure channel, deﬁned as W r : F r q → (F q ∪ {?}) r , where\nand W r (y|x) = 0 if y does not contain any erased bits and y = x. Its capacity equals r− r i=1 iε i . We computed the behavior of the virtual channels for n = 15 steps of the iteration and observed polarization to r + 1 levels for several values of r.\nA CKNOWLEDGMENT : The authors are grateful to Em- manuel Abbe, Eren S¸as¸o˘glu, and Emre Telatar (EPFL), and Leonid Koralov, Armand Makowski, and Himanshu Tyagi (UMD) for useful discussions of this work."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"E.
