Achieving the Holevo capacity requires not only optimal codes but also receivers that make collective measurements on long (modulated) codeword waveforms, and it is impossible to implement these collective measurements via symbol-by-symbol detection along with classical postprocess- ing [1], [2]. Here, we apply our recent results on the classical- quantum polar code [3]\u2014the ﬁrst near-explicit, linear, symmetric- Holevo-rate achieving code\u2014to the lossy optical channel, and we show that it almost closes the entire gap to the Holevo capacity in the low photon number regime. In contrast, Arikan\u2019s original polar codes, applied to the DMC induced by the physical optical channel paired with any conceivable structured optical receiver (including optical homodyne, heterodyne, or direct- detection) fails to achieve the ultimate Holevo limit to channel capacity. However, our polar code construction (which uses the quantum ﬁdelity as a channel parameter rather than the classical Bhattacharyya quantity to choose the \u201cgood channels\u201d in the polar-code construction), paired with a quantum successive- cancellation receiver\u2014which involves a sequence of collective non-destructive binary projective measurements on the joint quantum state of the received codeword waveform\u2014can attain the Holevo limit, and can hence in principle achieve higher rates than Arikan\u2019s polar code and decoder directly applied to the optical channel. However, even a theoretical recipe for construction of an optical realization of the quantum successive- cancellation receiver remains an open question."},"body":{"text":"Determining the ultimate limits on optical communication must involve an explicitly quantum analysis, because electro- magnetic waves are fundamentally quantum mechanical and high-sensitivity photodetection systems are limited by noise of quantum-mechanical origin. In quantum mechanics, the state of a physical system together with a description of the measurement made on that system determine the statistics of the measurement outcomes. Thus, in seeking the clas- sical information capacity of an optical channel, we must allow for optimization over both the transmitted quantum states and the receiver\u2019s quantum measurement. In particular, it seems inappropriate to restrict consideration to coherent- state (laser) transmitters and coherent-detection or direct- detection receivers. Imposing these structural constraints leads\nto Gaussian-noise (Shannon-type) capacity formulas for coher- ent (homodyne and heterodyne) detection and Poisson-noise capacity results for shot-noise-limited direct detection [4], [5]. None of these results, however, can be regarded as specify- ing the ultimate limit on reliable communication at optical frequencies. What is needed for deducing the fundamental limits on optical communication is an analog of Shannon\u2019s channel coding theorem\u2014but free of unjustiﬁed structural constraints on the transmitter and receiver\u2014that applies to data transmission over a quantum channel, viz., the Holevo- Schumacher-Westmoreland (HSW) theorem [6], [7], [8].\nThe HSW theorem, along with the Yuen-Ozawa converse [8], speciﬁes the channel capacity of a pure-loss optical channel [1]. Even though the single-letter Holevo quantity is an achievable rate, the receiver in general must make joint-detection (collective) measurements over long codeword blocks\u2014measurements that cannot be realized by detecting single-modulation symbols followed by classical decoding. For the pure-loss optical channel, a coherent-state modulation sufﬁces to attain the ultimate capacity, i.e., use of non- classical transmitted states or entangled codewords does not increase capacity [1]. We will use the term Holevo capac- ity unambiguously in this paper to refer to the single-letter Holevo rate of the pure-loss optical channel. The square- root-measurement, which in general is a positive operator- valued measure (POVM), applied to a random code gives the mathematical construct of a receiver measurement that can achieve the Holevo capacity [7]. The key questions that remain are how to design practical modulation formats, ex- plicit codes (with efﬁcient encoders), and most importantly, structured laboratory-realizable designs of Holevo-capacity- achieving joint-detection receivers (JDRs).\nLloyd et al. [9] conceptualized a receiver that can attain the Holevo capacity of any quantum channel by making a se- quence of \u201cyes/no\u201d projective measurements on codewords of a random codebook. However, the translation of their strategy to a structured receiver design for the optical channel was not clear. Sen later simpliﬁed Lloyd et al.\u2019s proof [10], and after this, we showed how to apply Sen\u2019s result in order to achieve the Holevo capacity of the pure-loss optical channel [11]. The strategy employs a random code and a sequence of multi- mode phase-space displacements and quantum-non-demolition \u201cvacuum-or-not\u201d measurements. In Ref. [2], one of us showed\nsome of the ﬁrst examples of structured optical JDRs for BPSK modulated binary codes, which induce superchannels over a codebook whose Shannon capacity per symbol is higher than the Shannon capacity of the single-use DMC induced by an optimal measurement on each received BPSK symbol [12]. In recent work, we generalized Arikan\u2019s polar code for the classical channel, to the classical-quantum (cq) polar code that can achieve the symmetric Holevo information for sending classical information over any quantum channel, i.e., the Holevo information rate when the input symbols are assigned equal priors [3]. This was the ﬁrst explicit (and linear) code that provably achieves the Holevo capacity, and a careful inspection of [3] reveals that this extension was non-trivial.\nIn this paper, we bring together our works from Refs. [2], [3] to show that a cq-polar code essentially achieves the Holevo capacity of the optical channel with BPSK modulation. We show that at low mean pulse energy (photon number), this ca- pacity is extremely close to the ultimate Holevo capacity (that with an unrestricted modulation). The receiver for our polar code is a quantum-limited successive-cancellation (SC) JDR that detects and decodes successively, while acting on the en- tire N -BPSK-symbol optical codeword waveform. It performs N R binary-outcome, quantum-non-demolition measurements (as opposed to the 2 N R measurement stages in [9], [11]), decoding one message bit at a time. The ﬁnal piece of the puzzle, a structured optical receiver design that implements our quantum SC decoder, remains a subject of ongoing research.\nConsider a lossy optical channel with transmissivity η ∈ (0, 1]. Each channel use is a T -sec-long pulse slot that can transmit one modulation symbol. The mean energy 1 per transmitted pulse is constrained to E photons per channel use. The Holevo capacity of this channel is given by g(ηE) bits/use, where g(x) = (1 + x) log(1 + x) − x log x. A\nphotons/sec-unit laser pulse s(t)e j(ω 0 +θ)t , t ∈ [0, T ) has energy E s = T 0 |s(t)| 2 dt photons. Quantum-mechanically, the state of this pulse is a coherent state |α , with α = √\nE s e jθ , where θ is taken w.r.t. some carrier-phase reference. 2 Since the channel preserves coherent states (with amplitude attenuation), |α → | √ ηα , let us assume WLOG that η = 1 (or, equivalently, treat E as the average received energy per pulse). The capacity-achieving input distribution is the isotropic Gaussian distribution p(α) = e −|α| 2 /E /πE, and the ultimate Holevo capacity, C ult (E) = g(E) bits/symbol.\nLet us consider an equi-prior (received) BPSK alphabet |\nE . The minimum average probability of error in discriminating the two BPSK pulses is given by P e,min =\n1 − e −4E /2, which can be attained exactly by the Dolinar receiver [12]. An ideal homodyne receiver achieves P e,hom = erfc\n2E /2. Using either the Dolinar receiver or the homodyne receiver on the BPSK pulses induces a binary symmetric channel (BSC) with crossover probabilities P e,min and P e,hom , thus attaining channel capacities, 3 C 1 (E) = 1 − H 2 (P e,min ) and C hom (E) = 1 − H 2 (P e,hom ) bits/symbol, respectively, where H 2 (·) is the binary entropy function. An- other strategy is to use the Kennedy receiver, which coherently shifts the BPSK constellation to |2\n0 , followed by direct detection (Poisson statistics). This induces a Z-channel with crossover probability e −4E and with P e,Ken = e −4E /2.\nConsider a binary pure-state channel of the form W : x → |ψ x , where W denotes the channel, x ∈ {0, 1}, and |ψ x\nare pure-state channel outputs. For the BPSK channel, |ψ 0 = |\nE . The relevant parameters that determine channel performance are the ﬁdelity\nand the symmetric Holevo information 4 I(W ) ≡ H(ρ), with ρ ≡ 1/2(|ψ 0 ψ 0 | + |ψ 1 ψ 1 |), where the von Neumann entropy H(σ) ≡ −Tr{σ log 2 σ}. The ultimate capacity achiev- able by the binary ensemble |ψ x , x ∈ {0, 1}, is given by the Holevo information of the average state ρ p ≡ p|ψ 0 ψ 0 | + (1 − p)|ψ 1 ψ 1 | maximized over the prior p ∈ [0, 1], i.e., C = max p H(ρ p ). The maximum for BPSK encoding is attained at p = 1/2. Therefore, the symmetric Holevo information is the Holevo capacity, I(W ) = H 2 1 + F (W ) /2 . Thus, for the BPSK alphabet, the Holevo capacity is given by:\nwhere the subscript (∞) signiﬁes that in order to achieve this capacity, the receiver must make collective measurements over long codeword blocks of an optimal binary code.\nIt is well-known that for E \t 1, a coherent-state mod- ulation along with standard (symbol-by-symbol) heterodyne detection asymptotically achieves the ultimate Holevo capacity g(E) bits/symbol [1], and that the capacity gap between conventional single-symbol receivers and the Holevo limit is the highest at low photon numbers (E \t 1) [2]. Hence, for the rest of this paper, we will focus on this E \t 1 regime. The energy efﬁciency C 1 (E)/E (bits/photon) of the BPSK channel, when the best single-symbol detection is used on each channel output symbol, caps off at 2 nats/photon (2.89 bits/photon) as E → 0. On the other hand, the Holevo limit to the energy efﬁciency of BPSK, lim E→0 C ∞ (E)/E = − ln E + 1 + E ln E + [· · · ] nats/photon [13] (where [· · · ] indicates higher order terms), not only goes to inﬁnity as E → 0, but also approaches the ultimate (unrestricted- modulation) Holevo limit g(E)/E asymptotically (see Fig. 1). The highest capacity (thus energy efﬁciency) with a BPSK modulation using a conventional receiver is achieved by ideal homodyne detection (see green plot in Fig. 1). Even though intensity modulation formats can attain an unbounded energy efﬁciency using a direct detection receiver, at low E (we will come back to this in Section II-1), at E 1, a BPSK code\u2014 along with a JDR\u2014is capable of practically closing the gap all the way to the ultimate limit to capacity (which is not possible by an intensity-only modulation).\nSo, how do we understand this huge gap between the best single-symbol Shannon capacity and the Holevo capacity of the BPSK alphabet (gap shown by the arrow in Fig. 1)? The two coherent states {|\nE } are non-orthogonal (and thus not distinguishable), with inner product e −2E > 0 as in (1). However, by virtue of the HSW theorem [6], the joint quantum states of well-chosen (i.i.d. random) 2 N R sequences of these two states (codeword waveforms) become nearly perfectly distinguishable as N → ∞ as long as R < C ∞ (E). Since these codeword states live in the N -symbol Hilbert space H ⊗N , a collective measurement is required to discriminate these states at a vanishingly low error rate. If the best single- symbol detection is used to detect each output BPSK symbol (thereby inducing a BSC and we stress that this is the case with Arikan\u2019s polar encoding and classical successive cancellation decoder applied to the optical channel ), then an ML decoding can map the output classical sequence of these N binary-outcome measurements to the correct codeword with a vanishingly low probability of error, however only as long as R < C 1 (E) (i.e., it can sustain a lower capacity). Classical information theory works with the classical-input to classical- output \u201cchannel\u201d, which is determined by the combination of the physical transmission medium and the choice of the receiver measurement. Quantum information theory, in this case the HSW theorem, provides us with a tool to evaluate the best achievable capacity by automatically optimizing over all physically-realizable receiver measurements.\nUnfortunately however, just like Shannon theory, the HSW theorem neither gives us a prescription to construct good low-complexity codes nor does it tell us how to realize the capacity-achieving receiver. In Section II, we provide\nthe ﬁrst explicit code (and a sequential-decoding collective measurement) that can achieve the BPSK Holevo capacity, the classical-quantum polar code .\nWe now demonstrate how to construct a polar code for the binary pure-state channel (a special case being the BPSK optical channel), by appealing to our recent results on cq-polar codes for sending classical data over a quantum channel. These codes achieve the symmetric Holevo information rate for a general (potentially mixed-state) binary input alphabet [3].\nConsider the binary pure-state classical-quantum channel W : x → |ψ x , x ∈ {0, 1}. Channels with ﬁdelity F (W ) ≤\nare nearly noiseless and those with F (W ) ≥ 1 − are near to being completely useless. Recall that the quantum ﬁdelity is a generalization of the classical Bhattacharya distance Z [14], [3]. Let us consider N = 2 n copies of W , such that the resulting channel is of the form: x N ≡ x 1 · · · x N → |ψ x N ≡ |ψ x 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ |ψ x N , where x N is the length N input and |ψ x N is the output state. We can extend Arikan\u2019s idea of channel combining [14] to this classical-quantum channel, by considering the channels induced by a transformation on an input bit (row) vector u N → |ψ u N G N , where G N = B N F ⊗n , with B N being a permutation matrix that reverses the order of the bits and F = 1 0 1 1 . This encoding is equivalent to a network of classical CNOT gates and permutations that can be implemented with complexity O(N log N ). See Fig. 2 for the ﬁrst and second instances of this encoding. Further instances are constructed recursively. We then deﬁne \u201csplit channels\u201d from the above combined channels as:\nThe interpretation of this channel is that it is the one \u201cseen\u201d by the bit u i if all the previous bits u i−1 1 are available and if all the future bits u N i+1 as randomized. This motivates the development of a quantum successive cancellation decoder [3] that tries to distinguish u i = 0 from u i = 1 by adaptively exploiting the results of past measurements and Helstrom- Holevo measurements [15], [16] for each bit decision.\nArikan\u2019s polar coding rule divides the channels into \u201cgood\u201d ones and \u201cbad\u201d ones [14]. Let [N ] ≡ {1, . . . , N } and 0 < β < 1/2. The polar coding rule for the classical-quantum channel divides the channels as follows:\nso that the channels in A are the good ones and those in A c are the bad ones. Observe that the quantum polar coding rule involves the quantum ﬁdelity parameter F (·), rather than a classical one such as the Bhattacharya distance.\nThe following theorem is helpful in determining what fraction of the channels become good or bad [17]:\nTheorem 1 (Convergence Rate): Let {X n : n ≥ 0} be a random process with 0 ≤ X n ≤ 1 and satisfying\nX n+1 ≤ qX n \t w.p. 1/2, \t (7) X n+1 = X 2 n \t w.p. 1/2, \t (8)\nwhere q is some positive constant. Let X ∞ = lim n→∞ X n exist almost surely with Pr{X ∞ = 0} = P ∞ . Then for any β < 1/2, lim n→∞ Pr{X n < 2 −2 nβ } = P ∞ , and for any β > 1/2, lim n→∞ Pr{X n > 2 −2 nβ } = 0.\nThe channel combining and splitting mentioned above can be considered as a random birth process in which a channel W n+1 is constructed from two copies of a previous one W n according to the rules in Section 4 of Ref. [3]. One can then consider the process {F n : n ≥ 0} ≡ { F (W n ) : n ≥ 0} and prove that it is a bounded super-martingale by exploiting the relationships given in Proposition 10 of Ref. [3]. From the convergence properties of martingales, it follows that F ∞ converges almost surely to a value in {0, 1}, and the probability that it equals zero is equal to the symmetric Holevo information I(W ). Furthermore, since the process F n satisﬁes the relations in (7-8), the following proposition on the convergence rate of polarization holds:\nTheorem 2: Given a binary input classical-quantum channel W and any β < 1/2, lim n→∞ Pr{F n < 2 −2 nβ } = I(W ).\nOne of our important advances in Ref. [3] was to estab- lish that a quantum successive cancellation decoder performs well for polar coding over classical-quantum channels with equiprobable inputs. Corresponding to the split channels W (i) N\nin (3) are the following projectors that attempt to decide whether the input of the i th split channel is zero or one:\nwhere {B ≥ 0} denotes the projector onto the positive eigenspace of a Hermitian operator B. After some calculations, we can readily see that\nThe above observations lead to a decoding rule for a successive cancellation decoder similar to Arikan\u2019s [14]:\nwhere h ˆ u i−1 1 is the outcome of the following i th (collective) measurement on the codeword received at the channel output (after i − 1 measurements have already been performed):\n}. We are assuming that the measure- ment device outputs \u201c0\u201d if the outcome Π B N (i),ˆ u i−1\noccurs and it outputs \u201c1\u201d otherwise. (Note that we can set Π B N (i),ˆ u i−1\n= I if the bit u i is a frozen bit.) The above sequence of measurements for the whole bit stream u N corresponds to a positive operator- valued measure (POVM) {Λ u N } where\nThe probability of error P e (N, K, A, u A c ) for code length N , number K of information bits, set A of information bits, and choice u A c for the frozen bits is as follows:\nwhere we are assuming a particular choice of the bits u A c in the sequence of projectors Π B N (N ),u N −1\n= I if u i is a frozen bit. We are also assuming that the sender transmits the information sequence u A with uniform probability 2 −K . The probability of error averaged over all choices of the frozen bits is then,\nThe following proposition from Ref. [3] determines the average ensemble performance of polar codes with a quantum successive cancellation decoder:\nProposition 3: For any classical-quantum channel W with binary inputs and quantum outputs and any choice of (N, K, A), the following bound holds\n1 2\nWe proved the above bound on the performance of our SC decoder by exploiting Sen\u2019s \u201cnon-commutative union bound\u201d [10] and Lemma 3.2 of Ref. [18] (which upper bounds the probability of error in a binary quantum hypothesis test by the ﬁdelity between the test states). The bound holds under the assumption that the sender chooses the information bits U A from a uniform distribution. Thus, by choosing the channels over which the sender transmits the information bits to be in A and those over which she transmits agreed-upon frozen bits to be in A c , we obtain the following bound on the probability of decoding error, as long as the code rate R = K/N < I(W ): Pr{U A = U A } = o(2 − 1 2 N β ). This completes the speciﬁcation of a cq polar code.\n1) Polar codes for q-ary input channels: The binary on-off keying (OOK) alphabet |0 , |\nE 0 with priors (1 − p ∗ , p ∗ ), E = p ∗ E 0 , with optimal p ∗ (E) ≈ −E ln E/3, E 1, along with a (symbol-by-symbol) direct detection (DD) receiver, attains a photon efﬁciency C OOK−DD (E)/E = − ln E − ln ln(1/E) + [· · ·] nats/photon [13] (magenta solid plot in Fig. 1). Furthermore, the Holevo capacity of the OOK alphabet is attained by p ∗ (E) ≈ E/2, and the photon efﬁciency is given by C OOK−Holevo (E)/E = − ln E + 1 +\n2E 1/2 ln E + [· · ·] nats/photon (solid red plot in Fig. 1). At E \t 1, a q- ary PPM constellation (which can be seen as a rate-(log 2 q)/q code over an underlying OOK alphabet) achieves a Shannon capacity (with DD) and a Holevo capacity, which are both extremely close to the respective unrestricted OOK capacities (dashed magenta and red plots in Fig. 1) respectively.\nThe q-ary PPM constellation achieves its capacity (both DD-Shannon and Holevo) for a uniform prior over its q inputs, forming a q-ary input classical-quantum channel. If q is a power of two, then a polar coding strategy to achieve the Holevo limit of PPM is straightforward, following the strategy to polar code for a uniform-input q-ary classical DMC (which can in turn achieve the PPM-DD capacity) [19]. Suppose that m ≡ log 2 (q). Then one can decompose the input variable X as an m-fold Cartesian product of binary variables (X 1 , . . . , X m ) and exploit a polar code for each of these variables. One ﬁrst exploits a quantum successive cancellation (SC) decoder to decode the variable X 1 under the assumption that the other variables X 2 , . . . , X m are chosen uniformly at random (and thus are independent) for this ﬁrst step. This decoding achieves a low probability of error as long as the indices for the information bits are chosen according to the polar coding rule for this ﬁrst induced channel. After decoding X 1 , the quantum measurement could potentially disturb the state at the channel output, but this disturbance will be asymptotically small if the measurement successfully decodes (a result known as the Gentle Measurement Lemma [20]). Then, X 1 is available as side information for decoding the next variable X 2 , and the procedure extends iteratively by decoding the current variable X i with the previous i ones available as side information and randomizing over the future m − i variables. The rate achieved with this scheme is equal to the symmetric Holevo capacity, by exploiting the chain rule and independence: I(X 1 · · · X m ; B) = m i=1 I(X i ; BX i−1 1 ).\nOur polar code and decoder construction in Ref. [3] offers the ﬁrst near-explicit construction that almost closes the gap to the Holevo capacity limit for low-photon-number (high photon-efﬁciency) optical communications. Our construction improves upon earlier schemes by providing an explicit linear code with an efﬁcient encoder (as opposed to a random code), while exponentially reducing the number of decoding steps (N R steps as opposed to the 2 N R in Refs. [9], [11]).\nSeveral practical questions remain unanswered, the most important one perhaps being an explicit design of our polar- decoding receiver, i.e., an optical circuit involving beamsplit- ters, phase-shifters, squeezers, and potentially one third-order Hamiltonian such as a Kerr interaction. In order to make this scheme practical, ﬁnding efﬁcient means to compute the rate matched cq polar codes for quantum channels would be necessary. Finally, it would be interesting to ﬁnd an efﬁcient classical-quantum polar coding scheme that can handle non- uniform input priors (viz., to achieve the Holevo limit of the OOK modulation alphabet)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"V.
