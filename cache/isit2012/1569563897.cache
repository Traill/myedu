Characterizing the capacity region of the two-user Gaussian interference channel (GIC) remains one of the fundamental unresolved problems in information theory. Recent breakthroughs in dealing with the capacity characterization of the GIC have made use of the linear deterministic interference channel (LD-IC) model [1], [2], [3]. The basic idea behind these works is that an appropriately deﬁned LD model can serve as a good approximation to the Gaussian channel. By gaining valuable insights from studying the LD-IC, the proof techniques and ideas can be lifted over to the GIC. The capacity region of the GIC has been characterized to within 1-bit in [2].\nIt is well known that feedback does not increase the capacity of the discrete memoryless point-to-point channel. However, feedback does increase the capacity of multi-user channels. The fact that feedback increases the capacity of the discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (MAC) was shown by Gaarder and Wolf [4]. Afterwards, Ozarow [5] found the capacity region of the two-user Gaussian MAC with noiseless feedback. Recently, Suh and Tse [6] obtained an interesting result that noiseless feedback can provide signiﬁcant capacity gains for the GIC. To understand the usefulness of feedback for the interference channel, consider the case of very-strong interference, in which the direct links are weaker than the cross (interference) links. In such a scenario, feedback can\nprovide a substantial capacity increment by utilizing the alter- nate path of Tx 1 → Rx 2 → Tx 2 → Rx 1 , i.e., the information intended from Tx 1 ﬁrst reaches Rx 2 , which is then received as feedback at Tx 2 , which utilizes the strong cross (interference) link to reach the eventual destination at Rx 1 . The approximate capacity region of the GIC with noiseless channel output feedback has been characterized in [6] within 2-bits. The results in [6] have been generalized to the case of the fully connected K-user IC [7], and the case of the cyclic K-user IC [8]. Vahid et al. consider an interesting generalization of [6] by studying the two-user GIC with rate-limited feedback in [9]. Rate-limited feedback refers to a setting in which the receiver can utilize all the information it has received so far and feed back information over an orthogonal channel of ﬁnite capacity (i.e., a bit-pipe). Several interesting results for the GIC with rate-limited feedback are obtained in [9].\nWhile rate-limited feedback may be useful in scenarios in which the feedback links have good coding schemes to protect feedback signals from error, it places much complexity on the receiver\u2019s side. As a result, this model is not appropriate when the complexity of the feedback design is a concern. In order to take this issue into account, this paper aims to investigate the model in which feedback signals are not well coded, and thus suffer from corruption by noise. In particular, if the channel output at receiver j is Y j , then the feedback to transmitter j is Y F,j = g j Y j + ˜ Z j , for j = 1, 2 (see Figure 1). This allows us to investigate the trade-off between complexity and data rate. With the eventual goal of understanding the capacity region of the GIC with noisy feedback, we present a linear deterministic model with partial feedback. We show that the LD-IC with partial feedback serves as a good approximation to the GIC with noisy feedback. The main result of this paper\nis a complete characterization of the sum-capacity of the LD- IC with partial feedback.\nIt is worth demarcating the model of partial feedback from the model of rate-limited feedback of [9], [10]. For the case of rate-limited feedback of l bits, the receiver can exactly control (encode) which l bits or functions thereof to feed back to its corresponding transmitter. In contrast, for the case of partial feedback, the receiver has no control over the feedback bits since the top l most signiﬁcant bits are received as feedback. Hence partial feedback can also be interpreted as naturally selected limited feedback. It is hence clear that the sum- capacity with l-bits of rate-limited feedback always serves as an upper bound on the sum-capacity with l-bits of partial- feedback. Our characterization of the sum-capacity of the LD- IC with partial feedback reveals that these two models are markedly different, and the sum-capacity with rate-limited feedback can strictly exceed the sum-capacity with partial feedback.\nThe two-user Gaussian interference channel with noisy feedback (see Figure 1), is deﬁned by the following input- output relationships:\nY 2i = h 12 X 1i + h 22 X 2i + Z 2i \t (2) Y F 1 ,i = g 1 Y 1i + ˜ Z 1i \t (3) Y F 2 ,i = g 2 Y 2i + ˜ Z 2i , \t (4)\nwhere X ji denotes the signal sent by transmitter j, Y ji denotes the output at receiver j, and Y F j ,i denotes the feedback received at transmitter j, for j = 1, 2, at time i , for i ∈ {1, 2, ..., T }, and {Z ji } T i=1 and { ˜ Z ji } T i=1 are independent, additive white Gaussian noise processes with zero means and unit variances. The forward channel gains {h 11 , h 21 , h 12 , h 22 } and the feedback channel gains {g 1 , g 2 } are assumed to be constant and known at all terminals. Aver- age unit power constraints are imposed at each transmitter, i.e., for a code of block length T , input sequences must satisfy 1 T E( T i=1 |X ji | 2 ) ≤ 1, j = 1, 2. The transmitter Tx j , for j = 1, 2, wishes to communicate a message m j ∈ {1, 2, ..., M j } = W j to the receiver Rx j . It is assumed that W 1 and W 2 are independent. An (M 1 , M 2 , T, P e ) feedback code for the interference channel (IC) with noisy feedback consists of a sequence of encoding functions\nf i j : W j × {Y F j 1 , Y F j 2 , ..., Y F j ,i−1 } → X ji \t (5) for j = 1, 2, and i = 1, 2, ..., T ;\nd jT : {Y j1 , Y j2 , ..., Y jT } → ˆ W j for j = 1, 2; \t (6) such that max {P e,1T , P e,2T } ≤ P e , where P e,1T and P e,2T denote the average decoding error probabilities, which are computed as P e,jT = E[P ( ˆ w j = w j |(w 1 , w 2 ) were sent )]. A rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) is achievable for the IC with noisy feedback if there exists an (M 1 , M 2 , T, P e )-feedback code such that P e → 0 as T → ∞, log(M 1 ) T ≤ R 1 and log(M 2 ) T ≤ R 2 . The\ncapacity region of the IC with noisy feedback is deﬁned as the closure of the set of all achievable rate pairs. With the goal of understanding the capacity region of the GIC with noisy feedback as deﬁned above, we next describe the linear deterministic interference channel with partial feedback.\nUsing the deterministic model in [1], a non-negative integer n kj is used to represent the channel gain from the transmitter Tx k to the receiver Rx j and it is given by n kj = log h kj + . Let q denote the maximum channel gains in the interference channel, i.e., q = sup(n kj ). Thus, the transmitted signal from the transmitter k at the time i will have a maximum of q bits visible to any receiver. Denote X ki = [X 1 ki , ..., X q ki ] T ∈ F q 2 , for k = 1, 2, where the leftmost bit is the most signiﬁcant bit and the rightmost bit is the least signiﬁcant bit. In this linear model, the effect of interference between various signals is captured as the superposition of those signals. At the time i, the outputs at the receivers are given as\nY 2i = S q−n 12 X 1i ⊕ S q−n 22 X 2i , \t (8) where S is the a square shift matrix of size q and the operation is modulo 2 addition in F 2 . Similarly, the channel gains for the feedback links can be represented by l j , for j = 1, 2, where l j = log g j √ var(Y\n+ , and hence the feedback signals at the transmitters are given as\nEffectively, via the feedback links, the transmitter j sees only the top l j bits of the received signals R ji (see Figure 2). The focus of this paper is on the symmetric LD-IC in which m = n 12 = n 21 , n = n 11 = n 22 , and l = l 1 = l 2 .\nDeﬁnition 1. Given a triple (n, m, l), let C P−FB (n, m, l) denote the set of all achievable rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) with partial feedback. We deﬁne the sum-capacity with partial feedback as\nWe present our results in terms of forward and feedback interference parameters deﬁned respectively as follows\nThe forward interference parameter α measures the normal- ized interference 1 , whereas the feedback interference param- eter β measures the level of normalized feedback.\nIn a similar manner, we denote C ∗ N−FB (α), C ∗ F−FB (α), and C ∗ RL−FB (α, β) as the normalized sum-capacities without feedback, with full (perfect) feedback and with rate-limited feedback of β (i.e., normalized rate-limited feedback of (l/n) bits) respectively.\nTheorem 1. The normalized sum-capacity of the symmetric LD-IC with partial feedback is given as follows\n⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩\nmin((2 − 2α) + 2(β − (1 − α)) + , 2 − α), 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 2 min(2α + 2(β − α) + , 2 − α), \t 1 2 ≤ α ≤ 2 3 2 − α, \t 2 3 ≤ α ≤ 1 α, \t 1 ≤ α ≤ 2 min(2 + 2(β − 1) + , α), \t 2 ≤ α.\n(13) The detailed proof of Theorem 1 is omitted due to space\nlimitations and can be found in [11]. In comparison, we recall here the corresponding (normalized) sum-capacities without feedback [1], [3], with full feedback [6], and with rate-limited feedback (of l-bits) [9]\n⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩\n2 − α, 2 3 ≤ α ≤ 1 α, \t 1 ≤ α ≤ 2 2, \t 2 ≤ α,\n2 − α, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 α, \t 1 ≤ α,\n⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩\nmin(2 − 2α + 2β, 2 − α), 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 2 min(2α + 2β, 2 − α), \t 1 2 ≤ α ≤ 2 3 2 − α, \t 2 3 ≤ α ≤ 1 α, \t 1 ≤ α ≤ 2 min(2 + 2β, α), \t 2 ≤ α.\n(16) We note here that these quantities satisfy the following in- equalities\nMoreover, from Theorem 1, it is clear that all of the inequalities above can be strict inequalities in general, de- pending on the relative values of (α, β). As an example, we have shown all four sum-capacities as functions of α, when β = 9/8 in Figure 3; and when β = 5/8 in Figure 4. The effect of feedback on the sum-capacity of the partial feedback model differs from that of the rate-limited feedback model. The feedback helps to increase the sum rate only when the feedback rate is greater than a certain threshold depending on the speciﬁc regime. The threshold is found to be equal to half of the sum-capacities in the model of no feedback. Intuitively, there is a tradeoff between complexity and capacity here.\nIn this regime, feedback does not increase the sum-capacity C ∗ P−FB when 0 ≤ β ≤ 1 − α. The sum-capacity starts to increase when 1 − α ≤ β. The difference between our normalized sum-capacity C ∗ P−FB and the sum-capacity in rate- limited feedback model C ∗ RL−FB is exactly 2(1 − α) in this case. The intuition behind this result is that the top n(1 − α) bits of the feedback are received perfectly by the intended receiver. Thus, feedback is redundant when the feedback link is too small.\nThe result in this case differs from the previous case. In this regime, feedback does not increase the sum-capacity when 0 ≤ β ≤ α. The sum-capacity starts to increase when α ≤ β . This result is counter-intuitive. Notice that only the top n(1 − α) bits of the feedback are already received perfectly by the intended receiver. The result here reﬂects the nature of interference in this regime. The difference between C ∗ P−FB and C ∗ RL−FB is 2α in this regime.\nFeedback does not increase the sum-capacity in this regime. Case 4: Very strong interference: 2 ≤ α\nIn this regime, the sum-capacity starts to increase only when 1 ≤ β. Notice that this is the case of very strong interference, where all the bits in all positions are interfered by the interference channel. Feedback in our model helps only when the rate of feedback is greater than the direct link\u2019s. The difference between C ∗ P−FB and C ∗ RL−FB is 2.\nIn this section, sum-capacity achieving coding schemes for speciﬁc values of (n, m, l) are presented. Gaining intuition from these examples, encoding schemes for arbitrary (n, m, l) are deduced in [11]. The converse is partially presented in the Appendix.\nIn this subsection, we present a capacity achieving encoding scheme for n = 6, m = 3, l = 4, to build intuition for the general case. Based on the example, a general encoding scheme can be deduced (see Figure 5). From the previous section, it is clear that the sum-capacity with no feedback is 6, with full feedback is 9, and with rate-limited feedback (of 4 bits) is also 9. Whereas, the sum-capacity with partial feedback of l = 4 bits is 8 bits/channel use. To this end, we will show that it is possible to achieve the rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) = (4, 4) for the LD-IC in consideration.\nIn the ﬁrst time slot t = 1, each transmitter sends 4 fresh information bits as shown in the ﬁgure. With a feedback channel gain l = 4, Tx 1 sees only the top 4 bits, which are a 1 , −, −, a 2 ⊕ b 1 , and hence it can recover b 1 . Notice that the feedback signal a 1 is redundant since it is already received cleanly at the intended transmitter Rx 1 . This is the price we have to pay for partial feedback in contrast to rate- limited feedback. In the second time slot i = 2, the transmitter Tx 1 sends 4 new fresh information bits again and encodes b 1 at the second topmost signal level as shown in the ﬁgure. The second topmost signal level is chosen to ensure that the resolving signal bit b 1 is received cleanly at Tx 1 . With the help of b 1 , Rx 1 can resolve the interference in the previous time slot and decode a 2 successfully. Due to symmetry, the same encoding operation is carried out at Tx 2 and Rx 2 .\nWe can repeat this encoding scheme again for a duration of B time slots. It is easy to see that this scheme asymptotically achieves a sum rate of 8 bits/channel use, which matches with the normalized sum rate of 2β as stated in Theorem 1.\nIn this subsection, we consider the speciﬁc example, where n = 7, m = 4 and l = 5. This corresponds to the case α ≤ β ≤ 1 (see Figure 6). From the ﬁgure, we can see that a sum rate of 10 bits/channel use, i.e., a normalized rate of 2α is asymptotically achievable, matching with the result in Theorem 1.\nThe interference channel with n = 1, m = 6, l = 2, i.e., α = 6, β = 2 is considered (see Figure 7). From the ﬁgure, it is easy to see that a sum rate of 4 bits/channel use, or a normalized sum rate of 2β is achievable, matching the result in Theorem 1.\nIn this paper, we have characterized the sum-capacity region of the deterministic interference channel with partial feedback. In addition, our result has been analyzed and compared with three other related models: without feedback, with full feedback and with rate-limited feedback. Being different from the rate-limited model, the feedback in our model helps to improve the sum-capacity only when the channel gains for the feedback links exceed certain thresholds, depending on the speciﬁc regimes. As on-going work, we are focusing on the capacity region of the GIC with output feedback corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise.\nIn this section, we present a sum-capacity achieving en- coding scheme and a converse proof for the very strong interference regime (2 ≤ α). The proof for the other regimes can be found in [11].\n1) Encoding Scheme for (n, m, l) such that 2n ≤ m.: For the case of strong interference, max(m, n) = m. The set of m bits at the transmitter Tx 1 (respectively Tx 2 ) is partitioned into 3 regions A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , with sizes (n, m − 2n, n). Accord- ing to the partition sizes, the m bits (channel output) received at Rx 1 can be described by: Y 1 = (B 1 , B 2 , B 3 ⊕ A 1 ) (see Figure 8). From Theorem 1, it is clear that feedback increases sum-capacity only if l > n. Hence, we focus on the case in which n < l.\nIn all time instances, Tx 1 encodes n fresh information bits in A 1 . An additional E 11 bits are encoded in the region A 2 . The optimal size of E 11 is a function of (l, m, n), which is chosen as min((l − n), m 2 − n). It remains silent in region A 3 to avoid interference. Similarly, Tx 2 sends fresh bits in (B 1 , E 21 ) and remains silent in B 3 .\nIn this ﬁrst time slot, Rx 2 can receive E 11 cleanly; however Rx 1 cannot. Moreover, via feedback of l most signiﬁcant bits, Tx 2 has access to E 11 and Tx 1 has access to E 21 . In the second time slot, Tx 1 , besides sending fresh bits in the top min(l, m 2 ) levels, forwards the bits E 21 in the remaining part of A 2 . Similarly, Tx 2 forwards the bits E 11 in the remaining part of B 2 . Thus, in this second time slot, Rx 1 can receive E 11 , and Rx 2 can receive E 21 . From the third time slot onwards, the same operation is repeated. A sum rate of min(2l, m) bits/channel use, or a normalized rate of min(2β, α) is achievable.\n2) Converse for (n, m, l) such that 2n ≤ m.: Let Y T F j for j = 1, 2, denote the feedback from Rx j to Tx j in the duration of T channel uses. Please refer to Figure 8 for the partition. We ﬁrst state the following lemma, which gives an upper bound on R 1 and R 2 .\nLemma 1. For α ≥ 2, we have R j ≤ n + (l − n) + for j = 1, 2.\n= (b) I(W 1 ; A T 1 , Y T F 2 |W 2 ) + H(W 1 |W 2 , A T 1 , Y T F 2 , X T 2 , Y T 1 ) ≤ H(A T 1 , Y T F 2 ) + H(W 1 |Y T 1 )\nwhere (a) follows from the independence between W 1 and W 2 ; (b) follows from the fact X T 2 is a function of (W 2 , Y T F 2 ), and Y T 1 is a function of (A T 1 , X T 2 ) and (c) follows from Fano\u2019s inequality. We next bound the term H(A T 1 , Y T F 2 ).\nCase 1: 0 ≤ l ≤ n. For this case, Y T F 2 is a function of A T 1 and we have H(A T 1 ) ≤ nT .\nCase 2: n ≤ l ≤ m. In this case, A T 1 is a function of Y T F 2 . We have H(Y T F 2 ) ≤ lT .\nFrom both these cases, we conclude that R 1 ≤ n+(l−n) + . The inequality for R 2 can be proved in a similar manner.\nFrom Lemma 1, we have R 1 + R 2 ≤ 2n + 2(l − n) + , thus proving the converse for the regime α ≥ 2."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S.
