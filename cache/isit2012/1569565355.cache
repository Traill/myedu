Among them, especially relevant are the unbounded support and the inﬁnite number of bits needed to represent signal points.\nIn practice, discrete distributions with a bounded support are typically preferred\u2014in this case, the number of points is allowed to grow with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Ungerboeck computed the rates that are achievable over the Gaussian channel when the channel input takes value in a ﬁnite constellation [2]. He observed that, when transmitting at a rate of R bits per channel use, there is not much to be gained from using constellations with size N larger than 2 R+1 . Ozarow and Wyner provided an analytic conﬁrmation of Ungerboeck\u2019s observation by deriving a lower bound on the rates achievable with ﬁnite constellations [3]. In both works, the channel inputs are assumed to be uniformly distributed on a lattice within some enclosing boundary, where the size of the boundary is scaled in order to ensure unit input-power.\nA related line of work considered signal constellations with favorable geometric properties, e.g., minimum Euclidean distance or minimum average error probability. For signal constellations with a large number of points, i.e., dense con- stellations, Forney et al. [4] estimated the loss in SNR with respect to the Gaussian input to be 10 log 10 πe 6 ≈ 1.53dB by comparing the volume of an n-dimensional hypercube with that of an n-dimensional hypersphere of identical average power. Later, Ungerboeck\u2019s work led to the study of multi- dimensional constellations based on lattices [5]\u2013[8].\nRecently, Wu and Verd´u have studied the information rates that are achievable over the Gaussian channel when the input takes value in a ﬁnite constellation with N signal points [9]. For every ﬁxed SNR, they show that the difference between the capacity and the achievable rate tends to zero exponentially in N. For the optimal constellation, the peak-to-average-power ratio grows linearly with N, inducing no capacity loss. This is in contrast to the constellations considered by Ungerboeck [2] and Ozarow and Wyner [3], which have a ﬁnite peak-to- average-power ratio.\nIn this work, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective to study the capacity loss incurred by signal constellations with a bounded support over the Gaussian channel for sufﬁciently small noise variance. In particular, we use the duality-based upper bound to the mutual information in [10] to provide a lower bound on the capacity loss. The results are valid for both peak- and average-power constraints and generalize directly to other additive-noise channel models. For sufﬁciently high SNR, our results recover the power loss of 1 .53dB for square signal constellations without invoking geometrical arguments.\nWe consider a discrete-time, complex-valued additive noise channel, where the channel output Y k at time k ∈ Z (where Z denotes the set of integers) corresponding to the time-k channel input x k is given by\nY k = x k + σW k , k ∈ Z. \t (2) We assume that {W k , k ∈ Z} is a sequence of independent and identically distributed, centered, unit-variance, complex random variables of ﬁnite differential entropy. We further assume that the distribution of W k does neither depend on σ > 0 nor on the sequence of channel inputs {x k , k ∈ Z}.\nThe channel inputs take value in the set S, which is assumed to be a bounded Borel subset of the complex numbers C. We further assume that S has positive Lebesgue measure and that 0 ∈ S.\nThe set S can be viewed as the region that limits the signal points. For example, for a square signal constellation, it is a square:\nfor some A > 0. Here Re (x) and Im (x) denote the real and imaginary part of x, respectively. Similarly, for a circular signal constellation,\nWe study the capacity of the above channel under an average-power constraint P on the inputs. Since the channel is memoryless, it follows that the capacity C S (P, σ) (in nats per channel use) is given by\nwhere the supremum is over all input distributions with essential support in S that satisfy E |X| 2 ≤ P.\nWe focus on C S (P, σ) in the limit as the noise variance σ tends to zero. In particular, we study the capacity loss, which we deﬁne as\n(Theorem 1 ahead asserts the existence of the limit.) Here C C (P, σ) denotes the capacity of the above channel when the support-constraint S is relaxed, i.e.,\nwhere the o(1)-term vanishes as σ tends to zero. (Here log(·) denotes the natural logarithm and h(·) denotes differential entropy.) The capacity loss (6) can thus be written as\nL = log P + log(πe) − h(W ) − lim σ↓0 \t sup\nBy choosing an input distribution that does not depend on σ, we can achieve 1\nwhich follows from the behavior of differential entropy under deterministic translation and under scaling by a complex number. Extending [10, Lemma 6.9] (see also [11]) to complex random variables yields then that, for every E |X| 2 < ∞ and E |W | 2 < ∞, the ﬁrst differential entropy on the right-hand side (RHS) of (11) satisﬁes\nConsequently, we obtain lim σ↓0 \t sup\nlim σ↓0 I(X; Y ) − log 1 σ 2 = \t sup\nLet P U denote the average power of a random variable that is uniformly distributed over S, i.e.,\nP U S |x| 2 d x S d x\nA small modiﬁcation of the proof in [12, Th. 12.1.1] shows that the density that maximizes h(X) for X ∈ S with probability one and E |X| 2 ≤ P has the form\nfor P < P U . Here I {statement} denotes the indicator function: it is equal to one if the statement in the brackets is true and it is otherwise equal to zero.\nApplying (15) to (10) yields L ≤ log P + log(πe) − log\nFor P = P U (and hence λ = 0), this becomes L ≤ log(πe) + log\nSpecializing (18) to a square signal constellation (3) yields (irrespective of A)\nwhich corresponds to a power loss of roughly 1 .53dB. Hence, we recover the rule of thumb that \u201csquare signal constellations have a 1 .53dB power loss at high signal-to-noise ratio.\u201d\nFor a circular signal constellation (4), the upper bound (18) becomes (irrespective of R)\nThe inequality in (17) holds with equality if the capacity- achieving input-distribution does not depend on σ, cf. (13). However, this is in general not the case. For example, for circularly-symmetric Gaussian noise and a circular signal constellation (4), it was shown by Shamai and Bar-David [13] that, for every σ > 0, the capacity-achieving input-distribution is discrete in magnitude, with the number of mass points growing with vanishing σ. Nevertheless, the following theorem demonstrates that the RHS of (17) is indeed the capacity loss.\nTheorem 1 (Main Result): For the above channel model, we have\nwhere λ = 0 for P ≥ P U , and where λ satisﬁes (16) for P < P U .\nNote 1: It is not difﬁcult to adapt the proof of Theorem 1 to other regions S and moment constraints. For example, the same proof technique can be used to derive the capacity loss when S is a Borel subset of the real numbers and the channel input\u2019s ﬁrst-moment is limited, i.e., E[ |X|] ≤ A.\nEquations (11)\u2013(13) demonstrate that the capacity loss (21) can be achieved with a continuous-valued channel input hav- ing density f (·). Using the lower-semicontinuity of relative entropy [14], it can be further shown that (21) can also be achieved by any sequence of discrete channel inputs {X N } for which the number of mass points N grows with vanishing σ, provided that\nwhere X is a continuous random variable having density f (·). (Here L → denotes convergence in distribution.) Such a sequence can, for example, be obtained by approximat- ing the distribution function corresponding to f (·) by two- dimensional step functions.\nIn view of (9), in order to prove Theorem 1 it sufﬁces to show that\nThe claim follows then by combining (23) with (17). To this end, we use the upper bound on the mutual information [10, Th. 5.1]\nwhere Q(·) denotes the input distribution; W (·|x) denotes the conditional distribution of the channel output, conditioned on X = x; and R(·) denotes some arbitrary distribution on the output alphabet. Every choice of R(·) yields an upper bound on I(X; Y ), and the inequality in (24) holds with equality if R(·) is the actual distribution of Y induced by Q(·) and W (·|·).\nTo derive an upper bound on I(X; Y ), we apply (24) with R(·) having density\n⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩\nis a normalizing constant; where S denotes the - neighborhood of S\nwhere S c denotes the complement of S ; and where λ is zero for P ≥ P U and satisﬁes (16) for P < P U .

By Chebyshev\u2019s inequality [15, Sec. 5.4], this can be further upper-bounded by\n2 . \t (36) It then follows that, for σ ≤ 1 π ,\nwhere the right-most term vanishes as σ tends to zero.

It further shows the information-rate losses of 2 m -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) for m = 10, 16, and 22, which were numerically obtained using\nGauss-Hermite quadratures [16], as described for example in [17, Sec. III]. Since for a ﬁxed m the information rate corresponding to 2 m -ary QAM is bounded by m bits, the rate loss of 2 m -ary QAM tends to inﬁnity as σ tends to zero. We observe that the lower bound on L(σ) converges to L = log(πe/6) ≈ 0.353 as σ tends to zero, but is rather loose for ﬁnite σ. However, in the proof of Theorem 1 we chose the density (25) to decay sufﬁciently slowly, so as to ensure that the lower bound on L holds for every unit-variance noise of ﬁnite differential entropy. For Gaussian noise, a density can be chosen that decays much faster, giving rise to a tighter bound.\nThe authors would like to thank Alex Alvarado for helpful discussions and for providing the QAM curves in Figure 1."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
