The terminals in a set M = {1, ..., m} observe correlated data, and wish to compute functions g 1 , ..., g m , respectively, of their collective data. To this end, they communicate interactively over a noiseless channel of unlimited capacity. It is required that this communication must not reveal the value of a speciﬁed private function g 0 of the data. If such a communication protocol exists, the functions are said to be securely computable. We formulate a Shannon theoretic multiterminal source model that addresses the basic question: When are the functions g 0 , ..., g m securely computable?\nThe answer to the general question above is not known. The case when the terminals in subset A of M compute only the private function g 0 and those not in A perform no computation was dealt with in [10]. Loosely speaking, denoting the collective data of the terminals by the random variable (rv) X M and the random value of the function g 0 by the rv G 0 , the maximum rate of randomness (in the data) that is independent of G 0 is H (X M |G 0 ). It was shown in [10] that if g 0 is securely computable (by the terminals in A), then\nwhere R ∗ has the operational signiﬁcance of being the min- imum overall rate of communication needed for a speciﬁc multiterminal source-coding task; this task does not involve any security constraint.\nIn this paper, we give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for secure computation of given functions. We extend the results of [10] and identify appropriate quantities R ∗ to establish necessary and sufﬁcient conditions of the same form as (1) and (2), respectively, for a broad class of settings involving the secure computation of multiple functions. The simpler case when the computed functions g 1 , ..., g m correspond to the observations of subsets of terminals is studied separately as a problem of secure multiterminal source coding.\nUnder the sufﬁcient condition (2), the secure computing scheme in [10] recovered the entire data at the (function seek- ing) terminals in A using communication that is independent of G 0 . Similarly, when one of the terminals computes the private function g 0 , i.e., g i = g 0 for some i ∈ M, our secure computing scheme enables the recovery of entire data at the terminal i.\nUnlike [10], we do not provide a single-letter formula for the quantity R ∗ , in general; nevertheless, conditions (1) and (2) provide a structural characterization of securely computable functions. Moreover, for special cases the conditions do take a single-letter form (see Example 1 and Corollary 4 below).\nThe problem of secure computing for multiple functions is formulated in the next section, followed by our main results in section III. Partial proof of our main result is sketched in the last section.\nNotation. The set {1, ..., m} is denoted by M. For i < j, denote by [i, j] the set {i, ..., j}. Let X 1 , ..., X m , m ≥ 2, be rvs taking values in ﬁnite sets X 1 , ..., X m , respectively, and with a known probability mass function. Denote by X M the collection of rvs (X 1 , ..., X m ), and by X n M = (X n 1 , ..., X n m ) the n independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). repetitions of rvs X M . For a subset A of M, denote by X A the rvs (X i , i ∈ A). Given R i ≥ 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, let R A denote the sum i∈A R i .\nFinally, for 0 ≤ < 1, we say an rv U is -recoverable from an rv V if there exists a function g of V such that Pr (U = g(V )) ≥ 1 − .\nWe consider a multiterminal source model for function computation using public communication, under privacy con- straints. This basic model was introduced in [4] in a separate context of SK generation with public transaction. Terminals 1, . . . , m observe, respectively, the sequences X n 1 , . . . , X n m of length n. For 0 ≤ i ≤ m, let g i : X M → Y i be given mappings, where the sets Y i are ﬁnite. Further, for 0 ≤ i ≤ m and n ≥ 1, the (single-letter) mapping g n i : X n M → Y n i is\ng n i (x n M ) = (g i (x 11 , . . . , x m1 ), . . . , g i (x 1n , . . . , x mn )), x n M = (x n 1 , . . . , x n m ) ∈ X n M .\nFor convenience, we shall denote the rv g n i (X n M ) by G n i , n ≥ 1, and, in particular, G 1 i = g i (X M ) simply by G i .\nEach terminal i ∈ M wishes to compute the function g n i (x n M ), without revealing g n 0 (x n M ), x n M ∈ X n M . To this end, the terminals are allowed to communicate over a noiseless public channel, possibly interactively in several rounds.\nDeﬁnition 1. An r-rounds interactive communication protocol consists of mappings\nwhere f ij denotes the communication sent by the jth node in the ith round of the protocol; speciﬁcally, f ij is a function of X n j and the communication sent in the previous rounds {f kl : 1 ≤ k ≤ i − 1, l ∈ M}. Denote the rv corresponding to the communication by\nDeﬁnition 2. For n > 0, n ≥ 1, we say that functions 2 g M = (g 0 , g 1 , ..., g m ), with private function g 0 , are n - securely computable ( n - SC) from observations of length n, and public communication F = F (n) , if\n(ii) F satisﬁes the secrecy condition 1\nBy deﬁnition, for n -SC functions g M , the private function G 0 is effectively concealed from an eavesdropper with access to the public communication F.\nDeﬁnition 3. For private function g 0 , we say that functions g M are securely computable if g M are n - SC from observa- tions of length n and public communication F = F (n) , such that lim\nIn this paper, we give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the secure computability of certain classes of functions g M = (g 0 , g 1 , ..., g m ). There are three classes of problems studied. In the ﬁrst two classes, we require at least one of the\nterminals to compute the private function g 0 , i.e. g i = g 0 for some 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The subclass with the additional restriction g i = g i (g 0 ) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m (along with g i = g 0 for some i) allows for a more structured secure computing protocol, and is studied ﬁrst. We note that the formulation in [10], in which the terminals in a given subset A of M are required to compute (only) g 0 securely, is a further particularization with\nIt was shown in [10] that (1) and (2) constitute, respectively, necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the functions above to be securely computable, with R ∗ being the minimum rate of interactive communication F that enables all the terminals in M to attain omniscience (see [4]), i.e., recover all the data X n M , using F and the decoder side information G n 0 given to the terminals in M \\ A. In fact, it was shown that when condition (2) holds, it is possible to recover X n M using communication that is independent of G n 0 .\nThe last class of problems we study is a generalization of the previous instance of secure multiterminal source coding. Speciﬁcally, we consider the situation where each terminal wishes to recover some subset X n M\nof the sources where M i ⊆ M \\ {i}, i.e.,\nWhile a characterization of securely computable functions in the general sense of Deﬁnition 3 is unresolved, for the speciﬁc classes above we provide matching necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the secure computability of g M . The guiding heuristic in this work is the following generalized interpretation of the results of [10]: Conditions (1) and (2) constitute, respectively, the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for functions g M = (g 0 , g 1 , ..., g m ) to be securely computable, where R ∗ is the inﬁmum of the rates of interactive communi- cation F in a multiterminal source coding problem described below:\nFor each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, the following must hold simultaneously: (P1) G n i is n -recoverable from (X n i , F ), and\n(P2) X n M is n -recoverable from (X n i , G n 0 , F ), i.e., the ter- minals attain omniscience, with G n 0 as side information that is used only for decoding (but is not used for the communication F ),\nwhere n → 0 as n → ∞ 3 . For the speciﬁc case in (3), R ∗ above has a single-letter formula. In general, a single-letter expression for R ∗ is not known.\nOur results, described in section III, are obtained by simple adaptations of this principle. Unlike [10], our conditions, in general, are not of a single-letter form. Nevertheless, they provide a structural characterization of secure computability. As an application, our results provide simple conditions for secure computability in the following illustrative example.\nExample 1. We consider the case of m = 2 terminals that observe binary symmetric sources (BSS) with underlying rvs X 1 , X 2 with joint pmf given by\nwhere 0 < δ < 1/2. The results of this paper will allow us to provide conditions for the secure computability of the four choices of g 0 , g 1 , g 2 below; it will follow by Theorem 1 that functions g 0 , g 1 , g 2 are securely computable if\nand conversely, if the functions above are securely computable, then\nwhere h(τ ) = −τ log τ − (1 − τ) log(1 − τ), and the constant τ = τ (δ) depends on the choice of the function. These characterizations are summarized in the next table.\nX 1 ⊕ X 2 \t X 1 ⊕ X 2 \t X 1 ⊕ X 2 1/2 X 1 ⊕ X 2 \t X 1 ⊕ X 2 \t φ \t 1\nX 1 ⊕ X 2 , X 1 .X 2 X 1 ⊕ X 2 , X 1 .X 2 X 1 .X 2 \t 2δ/3 X 1 ⊕ X 2 \t X 1 ⊕ X 2 \t X 1 .X 2 \t 2/3\nThe results for the ﬁrst two settings follow from [10]. The third and fourth results are new. In these settings, terminal 1 is required to recover the private function; our results below show that the conditions for the secure computability in these cases remain unchanged even if this terminal is required to attain omniscience. Note that since h(δ) < 1 for all 0 < δ < 1/2, there exists a communication protocol for securely computing the functions in the second setting. By contrast, a secure computing protocol for the functions in the third setting does not exist for any 0 < δ < 1/2, since h(δ) > 2δ/3.\nIn this section, we characterize securely computable func- tions for three settings. Our necessary and sufﬁcient conditions\nentail the comparison of H (X M |G 0 ) with a rate R ∗ ; the speciﬁc choice of R ∗ depends on the functions g M .\nDenote by R ∗ 1 (g M ) the closure of the (nonempty) set of pairs\nwith the inﬁmum taken over rates R 1 , ..., R m satisfying the following constraints:\nThe quantity inf n,F R (1) F corresponds to the solution of a multiterminal source coding problem. Speciﬁcally, it is the inﬁmum of the rates of interactive communication that satisfy (P1) and (P2) above (see [3, Theorem 13.5], [4]).\nNote that the SK-based scheme for secure computing given in section IV relies critically on the functional relation g i = g i (g 0 ).\n(2) The next case is a relaxation of the previous model in that the restriction g i = g i (g 0 ) for i ∈ [m 0 + 1, m] is dropped. Let R ∗ 2 (g M ) denote the closure of the set of pairs\nwith the inﬁmum taken over rates R 1 , ..., R m and R m 0 +1 , ..., R m satisfying the following constraints:\n(2c) ∀L ⊆ M, [1, m 0 ] ⊆ L, and L ⊆ [m 0 + 1, m] with either L = M or L = [m 0 + 1, m],\nThe quantity inf n,F R (2) F corresponds to the solution of a multiterminal source coding problem, and is the inﬁmum of the rates of interactive communication F that satisfy (P1) and (P2) above, and additionally satisﬁes:\n(P3) X n M is n -recoverable from G n j , G n 0 , F , m 0 < j ≤ m. This modiﬁcation corresponds to the introduction of m − m 0 dummy terminals, with the jth dummy terminal observing G n j , m 0 < j ≤ m; the dummy terminals can be realized by a terminal i in [1, ..., m 0 ] that recovers X n M from (X n i , F). As remarked before, the SK-based secure computing scheme in section IV does not work for this case, and a secure computing scheme based on the dummy terminals above is used instead. The conditions (P2) and (P3) above correspond to omniscience at the terminals in the extended model, with G n 0 provided as side information only for decoding.\n(3) The last case concerns multiterminal source coding without revealing the private data (see (4)). Denote by R ∗ 3 (g M ) the closure of the set of pairs\nwith rates R 1 , ..., R m satisfying the following constraints: (3a) For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀ L ⊆ M i ⊆ M \\ {i},\nAs before, the quantity inf n,F R (3) F corresponds to the inﬁmum of the rates of interactive communication that satisfy (P1) and (P2) above.\nOur main result below characterizes securely computable functions for the three settings above.\nTheorem 1. For i = 1, 2, 3, with functions g 0 , g 1 , ..., g m as in the case ( i) above, the functions g M are securely computable if the following condition holds:\nConversely, if the functions above are securely computable, then\nTheorem 1 affords the following heuristic interpretation. The quantity H (X M |G 0 ) represents the maximum rate of randomness in X n M that is (nearly) independent of G n 0 . On the\nother hand, R ∗ i (g M ) is an appropriate rate of communication for the computation of g M ; we show that latter being less than H (X M |G 0 ) guarantees the secure computability of g M .\nAlthough the conditions for secure computability above are not of a single-letter form in general, they do reduce to such a form for speciﬁc instances. The following result provides a sufﬁcient condition for obtaining single-letter conditions for characterizing securely computable functions.\nLemma 2. For case (i), i = 1, 2, 3, if for all n ≥ 1 and interactive communication F\nThe proof is a simple consequence of the deﬁnition of R ∗ i (g M ) in (11). Note that R (i) constant has a single-letter form.\nRemark. As mentioned before, the quantity inf n,F R (i) F is the inﬁmum of the rates of interactive communication that satisﬁes (P1),(P2) for i = 1, 3, and satisﬁes (P1)-(P3) for i = 2. Thus, when the conditions of Lemma 2 hold, we have from Theorem 1 that g M are securely computable if\nwhere R (i) constant is the minimum rate of communication that satisﬁes (P1), (P2) for i = 1, 3, and satisﬁes (P1)-(P3) for i = 2.\nAs a consequence of Lemma 2, we obtain below a single- letter characterization of securely computable functions, with m = 2, in a special case; the following lemma, which is a special case of [5, Lemma B.1] (see also [6, Theorem 1]), is instrumental to our proof.\nLemma 3. Let m = 2. For an interactive communication F, we have\nCorollary 4. For m = 2, for functions g 0 , g 1 , g 2 with g 1 = g 0 and g 2 = g 2 (g 0 ), we have\n(13) Proof: The constraints (1a) and (1b) satisﬁed by rates\nThus, R (1) constant equals the term on the right side of (13). From H (G 2 |G 0 ) = 0, and the expression for R (1) F above, we have\nwhere the last inequality follows from Lemma 3. The result then follows from Lemma 2.\nWe next derive simple conditions for secure computability for the BSS in Example 1\nExample 2. Consider the setup of Example 1, with g 0 = g 1 = X 1 ⊕ X 2 , X 1 .X 2 and g 2 = X 1 .X 2 . By Corollary 4 and the observation H (G 2 |X 2 ) = h(δ)/2, we get R ∗ 1 (g M ) = 3h(δ)/2. Since H (X 1 , X 2 | G 0 ) = H (X 1 , X 2 | X 1 ⊕ X 2 ) −\nH (X 1 .X 2 | X 1 ⊕ X 2 ) = δ, the characterization of secure computability claimed in Example 1 follows from Theorem 1.\nExample 3. In the setup of Example 1, consider g 0 = g 1 = X 1 ⊕ X 2 and g 2 = X 1 .X 2 . This choice of g 0 , g 1 , g 2 is an in- stance of case ( 2) above. For an interactive communication F, a manipulation of constraints (2a), (2b), (2c) in the deﬁnition of R (2) F , yields\nNext, note from (15) that for any interactive communication F,\nR (2) F ≥ 1 n [H(F) − H (F|X n 1 ) − H (F|X n 2 )] + H (G 2 |X 2 ) + H (X 2 |X 1 )\nwhere the last inequality above follows from Lemma 3. The characterization in Example 1 follows from (16), (17), and H (X 1 , X 2 |G 0 ) = 1, using Lemma 2 and Theorem 1.\nIn this section we present the key ideas in the proof of sufﬁciency part of Theorem 1 for case ( 1). The sufﬁciency proof for other cases, and the proof of necessity, are omitted due to space constraints.\nIf H (X M |G 0 ) > R ∗ 1 (g M ) holds, then from the deﬁnition of R ∗ 1 (g M ), for all sufﬁciently small > 0 there exist n ≥ 1 and interactive communication F = F (X n M ) such that\n1 n\nwhere R 1 , ..., R m satisfy the constraints (1a), (1b). From (18), using the approach of the proof of sufﬁciency in [10, Theorem 5], we ﬁrst show the existence of an interactive communication F = F X N M that is almost independent of G N 0 , and attains omniscience at the terminals in M, with side information G N 0 given for decoding to the terminals in [m 0 + 1, m], for N = nk sufﬁciently large; the interactive communication F\nincludes F. Next, for m 0 < j ≤ m, denoting by ˆ F j the Slepian-Wolf codeword for G N j given X N j and F , we show the existence of rvs K j = K j X N j of approximate rate\nhence, the communication F , K l ⊕ ˆ F l , m 0 < l ≤ m is al- most independent of G N 0 .\nFor m 0 < l ≤ m, K l ⊕ ˆ F l is used as a one-time-pad to send ˆ F l , and so G N j , to terminal l observing X N l , F . The existence of K m 0 +1 , ..., K m follows by extending the proof of [9, Theorem 4], using (18), and the observation\nThis work beneﬁted greatly from the discussions with Prof. Prakash Narayan.
