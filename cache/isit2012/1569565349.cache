Trafﬁc from each node in the session has to be sent to every other node in the session. If the session does not consist of all the nodes, the remaining nodes act as relays. The nodes are connected by undirected edges whose capacities are independent and identically distributed random variables. We study the asymptotics of the capacity region (with network coding) in the limit of a large number of nodes, and show that the normalized sum rate converges to a constant almost surely. We then provide a decentralized push-pull algorithm that asymptotically achieves this normalized sum rate."},"body":{"text":"1 n\nMulticast : We next address a more general setting with only a subset of k n nodes in the multicast session, where lim n→∞ k n /n = α and α < 1. Data from each of the k n nodes has to reach every one of the other k n −1 nodes. The remaining n − k n nodes serve as relays. Again, in an edge-capacitated framework where each edge is independent and identically distributed (iid) with distribution F , we are interested in the set of all achievable rate tuples r 1 , · · · , r k n in the asymptotics of a large number of nodes n. We demonstrate that the capacity region is almost surely\n1 n\nThe LP formulation of this problem is in Section II, proof of the converse is in Section III, and proof of achievability is in Section V. Our proof of achievability in this case is via a combination of \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d that suggests a decentralized implementation.\nOur achievability proof is based on ﬂows (allowing for duplications) and thus do not employ network coding. While it has been observed empirically that the gain from network coding is marginal for random network topologies (see [1, p.1017]), our results of this paper imply that there is indeed no asymptotic gain from network coding with respect to the performance metric of normalized rate. Our simple \u201cpush- pull\u201d scheme in the multicast case and the observation that asymptotically network coding does not yield a gain for almost every graph (with respect to a probability distribution on graphs) are the central contributions of this paper.\nConsider the allcast problem described in Section I. Right- away, we observe that the allcast capacity region in the undirected capacitated network does not depend on who the sender is ([1, Th. 4]). This is straightforward for ﬂow-based schemes, but the same holds under coding as well; see [1, Th. 4]. We may therefore assume that there is only one sender (say node 1), and all other n − 1 nodes are recipients that must receive all information sent by node 1. Thus, the rates are (r 1 , 0, 0, . . .), and we characterize r 1 .\n(node 1) to the k n − 1 other recipients is the maximum value of the modiﬁed LP:\nSet α n = k n /n, and denote the maximum value of (4) as π n (α n ). The above LP is the same as that of (3) with T n replaced by the less restrictive T n (k n ).\n\u2022 Let χ n and χ n (k n ) denote the maximum throughput achievable in the allcast and multicast settings with the added possibility of network coding at each node. (The dependence of these quantities on the edge capacities is understood and suppressed).\n\u2022 Let η n denote the strength of the allcast network deﬁned as follows. Let P denote the set of all partitions of the vertex set {1, 2, . . . , n}. Consider a partition ℘ ∈ P. Let ∂℘ denote the set of intercomponent edges. Deﬁne\n\u2022 Let η n (k n ) denote the strength of the multicast network with k n nodes in the session. This is deﬁned as follows. Let P(k n ) denote the set of all partitions of the vertex set {1, 2, . . . , n} such that each component of a partition contains at least one of the session nodes {1, 2, . . . , k n }. Deﬁne\nTheorem 1: (Li et al. [1, Th. 2 and Th. 3]) (a) For any allcast session, π n = χ n = η n .\nWe can easily ﬁnd upper bounds on η n and η n (k n ) as in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2: Let {C i,j } 1≤i<j≤n denote the undirected edge capacities. We then have the following upper bounds:\n1 2\nFor the multicast case, use (11) in (8) to obtain η n (k n )\nFurthermore, it sufﬁces to prove achievability for graphs whose edge capacities are independent Bernoulli random vari- ables with parameter p, i.e., lim inf n→∞ π n /n ≥ p/2 almost surely. By following standard techniques of truncation, scaling, and quantization, see for example [5], one can show that lim inf n→∞ π n /n ≥ (1/2)E[C] for any generic distribution with an expectation.\nGraphs whose edge capacities are independent Bernoulli random variables with parameter p are the Erd˝os-R´enyi ran- dom graphs denoted G(n, p). For such graphs, even for p as low as (28 log n/n) 1/3 , Catlin et al. [6, Sec. 3] proved the stronger result that\nBy the strong law of large numbers, it is then obvious that lim n π n /n = p/2 almost surely.\nWhile one could in principle proceed as in Catlin et al. [6] to prove achievability, we wish to provide a more constructive proof of achievability for cases when α < 1. We shall use Theorem (3) in the proof. Our constructive procedure does not yet handle the boundary case when α = 1.\nTheorem 4: For the multicast problem with k n in the ses- sion, let lim n→∞ k n /n = α < 1. We then have\nProof: As in the proof of Theorem 3, converse was already shown in (10). So showing achievability sufﬁces, and further this can be shown on Erd˝os-R´enyi random graphs with parameter p.\nNext observe that the subset of session nodes alone form a complete graph with k n vertices for which Theorem 3 is applicable. Using the scheme suggested by that theorem, we have\nis achievable for simultaneous multicast, almost surely, with- out using any of the relay nodes.\nRemoving these direct links between the session nodes, we end up with a graph in Figure 1, where the session nodes are now only connected to the m n = n − k n relay nodes. The edge to each relay node from each session node has Bernoulli (p) capacity. Further the relay nodes have inter- relay edge capacities that are independent Bernoulli (p) random variables. We now claim that a rate π (2) n can be simultaneously multicast to the k n session nodes (solely with the help of the relay nodes), and the rate almost surely satisﬁes\nPush step 2 : Each ﬁrst hop relay node relays its bit to each neighbor that is not already a ﬁrst hop relay. The resulting bit carrying relays are called secondary relays. Note that there may be secondary relays that are in contact with the source, but did not receive any bit on account of the source\u2019s degree exceeding m n p(1 − ε).\nThe bit-map of available bits with relays is as follows. Let us index the bits as 1, 2, . . . , m n p(1 − ε), and relays as 1, 2, . . . , m n . Then row i indicates what relay i contains.\nIn the table, X i,j = 1 if relay i (with m n p(1 − ε) < i ≤ m n ) is connected to ﬁrst hop relay j. Clearly, the presence or absence of this edge is independent of all other events, and so X i,j is a Bernoulli (p) random variable.\nData is \u201cpulled\u201d from the relays by the session nodes as follows. Consider a session node i.\nPull step 1 : If a session node i is connected to a ﬁrst hop relay, it pulls the corresponding bit. Let A (n) 2 (i) be the event there are less than m n p 2 (1 − ε) 2 ﬁrst hop relays that our session node is in contact with. Again by Bernstein\u2019s inequality, Pr{A (n) 2 (i)} ≤ e − m n c 2 for some c 2 > 0.\nPull step 2 : The session node now has to pull the remaining bits from the secondary relays. The number of bits that remain to be pulled is\nThe number of relays that are not ﬁrst hop relays is at least m n − m n p(1 − ε) = m n (1 − p(1 − ε)).\nLet A (n) 3 (i) be the event that the session node is connected to fewer than p(1 − ε) fraction of these nodes, i.e., to fewer than m n (1 − p(1 − ε)) · p(1 − ε) = b n such relays. By Bernstein\u2019s inequality again, Pr{A (n) 3 (i)} ≤ e − m n c 3 for some c 3 > 0.\nPull step 3 : Assume now that A (1) n ∪ A (2) n (i) ∪ A (3) n (i) does not occur. Then the matrix rows corresponding to the secondary relays in contact with the session node and the columns corresponding to the bits not yet pulled constitutes a b n × b n square submatrix whose entries are conditionally iid Bernoulli (p) random variables. We may view this as a bipartite graph with (non-ﬁrst-hop) relays on the one side and not-yet- pulled bit indices on the other side. There are b n vertices on each side. The edges of this bipartite graph are X k,l which are independent Bernoulli (p) random variables. For a selected\nnot be connected to any vertex in V 3−i −Γ(A) The probability that this happens for A ⊂ V 1 is at most\nThere are n a choices for A ⊂ V 1 with |A| = a, n a−1 choices for Γ(A), and an extra factor of 2 to account for A ⊂ V i , i = 1, 2. Using these and n k ≤ (en/k) k , we get\nn a\nThe probability that there is some isolated node is upper bounded by γ 2 (n) := n(1 − p) n−1 . Thus the probability that the bipartite graph of n vertices does not have a complete matching is at most γ(n) = γ 1 (n) + γ 2 (n).\nWhen we have b n vertices on each side, the above bound turns out to be γ(b n ). Straightforward computations yield that\nThis work was done as part of a summer internship by V. N. Swamy in her junior undergraduate year at the Indian Institute of Science, and where P.
