We adopt the framework of Hou, Borkar, and Kumar, and study the maximum total timely throughput of the network, denoted by C T 3 , which is the maximum average number of packets delivered successfully before their deadline. We propose a deterministic relaxation of the problem, which converts the problem to a network with deterministic delays in each link. We show that the additive gap between the capacity of the relaxed problem, denoted by C det , and C T 3 is bounded by 2 N (C det + N 4 ), which is asymptotically negligible compared to C det , when the network is operating at high-throughput regime.

This motivates two fundamental questions: ﬁrst, how much is the ultimate capacity gain from opportunistic utilization of network heterogeneity for delay-sensitive trafﬁc? And second, what are the optimal policies that exploit network heterogeneity for delivery of time-sensitive trafﬁc?\nIn this paper, we study these questions in the downlink of a heterogeneous wireless network with N Access Points (AP\u2019s) and M clients, where each AP is using a distinct frequency band; and all AP\u2019s are connected to each other through a Backhaul Network (see Fig. 1(a)), with error free links.\nWe focus on real-time video streaming applications, such as video-on-demand, video conferencing, and IPTV, that require tight guarantees on the timely delivery of packets. As a result, we focus on the notion of timely throughput, proposed in [2], which measures the long-term average number of packets\ndelivered for each client before the deadline as an analytical metric for evaluating both throughput and QoS for delay- constrained ﬂows. So, the total timely throughput ( T 3 ) is the summation of timely throughputs of all the M clients; and our objective is then to ﬁnd the maximum achievable T 3 , denoted by C T 3 , over all possible scheduling policies.\nWe face a complicated combinatorial optimization problem to ﬁnd C T 3 , as there are exponential (in M ) different ways of assigning packets to the AP\u2019s for transmission. To overcome this challenge, we propose a deterministic relaxation of the problem, which is based on converting the problem to a network with deterministic delays for each link. Our main contribution in this paper is two-fold. First, we show that the value of the solution to the relaxed problem, denoted by C det , is very close to C T 3 . Therefore, instead of solving the main problem, one can solve the relaxed problem to approximate C T 3 . Moreover, the solution to the relaxed problem proposes a scheduling policy for the main problem which achieves a value close to C T 3 . Second, we show that the relaxed problem, which is a packing problem, can also be approximated in polynomial time using a simple LP rounding method.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes our network model, and explains the problem for- mulation. Section III describes and formulates the relaxation of the problem, and states the main results. Finally, Section IV and Section V provide the proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, respectively.\nRelated Work: Although there are classical results [5], [6] on scheduling clients over time-varying channels and char- acterizing the average delay of service, in recent years there has been increasing research on serving delay-sensitive trafﬁc over wireless networks [7]-[12]. The most related work to this paper is the work of Hou et. al [2], in which they have proposed a framework for jointly addressing delay, delivery ratio, and channel reliability. For a network with one AP and N clients, the timely throughput region for the set of N clients has been fully characterized in [2]; and the work has been extended to variable-bit-rate applications in [3], and time-varying channels and rate adaptation in [4]. Although in [2]-[4] they provide tractable analytical results and low- complexity scheduling policies, the analyses are done for the case of only one AP. This paper aims to extend the results to\nthe case of having multiple AP\u2019s, where there is an additional challenge of how to split the packets among different AP\u2019s.\nIn this section we describe our network model and illustrate the notion of timely throughput that was ﬁrst introduced in [2]. We consider the downlink of a wireless network with M wireless clients Rx 1 , . . . , Rx M that have packet requests, and N Access Points AP 1 , . . . , AP N . These AP\u2019s have error-free links to the Backhaul Network (see Fig.1). In addition, we assume that time is slotted, and each AP may make one packet transmission in each time-slot. Furthermore, the time-slots are grouped into intervals of length τ .\nEach AP is connected via unreliable wireless links to a subset (possibly all) of the wireless clients. These unreliable links are modeled as packet erasure channels that are i.i.d over time, and have ﬁxed success probabilities for each transmis- sion. In addition, channels are independent and do not have interference with each other. The success probability of the channel between AP i and Rx j is denoted by p ij ; and if there is no link between AP i and Rx j , then p ij = 0.\nWe assume that at the beginning of each interval each client has request for a new packet. Right before the start of an interval, each requested packet for that interval is assigned to one of the AP\u2019s to be transmitted to its corresponding client. Furthermore, during a time-slot of an interval, each AP picks one of the packets assigned to it to transmit. At the end of that time-slot the AP will know if the packet has been successfully delivered or not. If the packet is successfully delivered, the AP removes that packet from its buffer and does not attempt to transmit it any more. The packets that are not delivered by the end of the interval are dropped from the AP\u2019s.\nDeﬁnition 1: The decisions on how to assign the requested packets for an interval to the AP\u2019s, and which packet to trans- mit on a time-slot by each AP are speciﬁed by a scheduling\npolicy , denoted by η, which makes the decisions causally based on the entire past history of events. We denote the set of all possible scheduling policies by S.\nDeﬁnition 2: A greedy static scheduling policy, η g-static , is a scheduling policy in which each AP becomes responsible for serving packets of a ﬁxed subset of clients for all intervals; and the packets of clients assigned to an AP are served according to their channel success probabilities. In particular, a greedy static scheduling policy η g-static is fully speciﬁed by the vector Π = [I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I N ], where I i \u2019s partition the set {1, 2, . . . , M }, indicating how the packet of clients are assigned to AP\u2019s.\nConsequently, when a greedy static scheduling policy is applied and after the clients are assigned to the AP\u2019s to get service, during each interval each AP ﬁrst serves the client with the highest channel success probability.\nLet N j (r, η) denote the number of successful deliveries for Rx j using scheduling policy η during the r th interval. When using η, the timely throughput of Rx j , denoted by R j (η), is deﬁned as\nr \t , j = 1, 2, . . . , M. 1 (1) The total timely throughput resulting from using η, T 3 (η), is deﬁned as\nOur objective is to ﬁnd the maximum achievable T 3 , denoted by C T 3 . More precisely, our optimization problem is\nAccording to Lemma 1 that we state later on, the optimiza- tion in (3) can be reduced to optimization over greedy static scheduling policies. So, the optimization in (3) is equivalent to ﬁnding the partition Π such that the corresponding η g-static maximizes M j =1 R j (η) for η = η g-static . However, this is still quite challenging as the number of possible greedy static scheduling policies is N M , which grows exponentially in M for N > 1.\nTo overcome the aforementioned challenge, we now de- scribe our deterministic relaxation method that we use to approximate the main problem (3) and state the main results.\nSuppose that packet of client j is the only packet assigned to AP i . The memory-less erasure channel with success prob- ability p ij can be viewed as a pipe with variable delay which takes the packet from AP i and gives it to Rx j according to\nthat variable delay. The probability distribution of the delay is Geometric with parameter p ij ; and without any deadline, it takes 1 p ij time-slots on average for packet of Rx j to be delivered when transmitted by AP i .\nTo simplify the Main Problem, we propose to relax each channel into a bit pipe with deterministic delay equal to the inverse of its success probability. Therefore, for any packet of Rx j , when assigned to AP i , we associate a ﬁxed size of\nto that packet. This means that each packet assigned to an AP can be viewed as an object with a size, where the size varies from one AP to another. On the other hand, we know that each AP has τ time-slots during each interval to send the packets that are assigned to it. Therefore, we can view each AP as a bin of capacity τ . Therefore, our new problem is a packing problem; i.e., we want to see over all different assignments of objects to bins what the maximum number of objects is that we can ﬁt in those N bins of capacity τ . We denote this maximum by C det . More precisely, if we deﬁne x ij as the 0 − 1 variable which equals 1 if packet of client j is assigned to AP i , and 0 otherwise, then the Relaxed Problem (RP) can be formulated as following.\nWe now state our main results. The ﬁrst theorem bounds the gap between the solution to the Main Problem in (3) and its deterministic relaxation in (4).\nTheorem 1: Let C T 3 denote the value of the solution to our Main Problem in (3). Also, let C det denote the value of the solution to our Relaxed Problem in (4). We have\nRemark 1: As the number of AP\u2019s, N , is typically small, Theorem 1 implies that as C T 3 → ∞, C det C\n→ 1. Hence, the bounds in Theorem 1 suggest the asymptotic optimality of solving RP instead of MP.\nRemark 2: The bounds in Theorem 1 are worst-case bounds, and via numerical analysis illustrated in Figure 2 we observe that the gap between C T 3 and C det is in most cases much smaller, even for a limited number of clients. Therefore, rather than solving the Main Problem, we can solve the Relaxed Problem and still get a value as the solution which is very close to the solution for the main problem.\nThe next theorem demonstrates that the relaxed problem can be approximated efﬁciently.\nTheorem 2: Suppose that x ∗tr is a basic optimal solution to the LP relaxation of (4). We have\nRemark 3: According to Theorem 2 if we ﬁnd a basic optimal solution to LP relaxation of (4), and then round down the solution to get integral values, the result will deviate from the optimal solution ( C det ) by at most N . Note that N is typically very small; and therefore, this algorithm performs well in approximating the optimal solution to RP.\nRemark 4: The Relaxed Problem in (4) is a special case of the well-known Maximum Generalized Assignment Prob- lem (GAP), for which there is a large body of literature. Although GAP is APX-hard [16], there are several approxi- mation algorithms for it, including [16]-[17]. The performance guarantees in the literature are concerned with multiplicative gap. However, our result in Theorem 2 suggests an additive gap performance guarantee of N for the special case of GAP presented in (4), which provides a tighter approximation guarantee for our problem of interest for large C det .\nFinally, we state the following corollary that bounds the gap between C T 3 and the T 3 of the greedy static scheduling policy that uses the assignment policy suggested by the solution to relaxed problem.\nCorollary 1: Suppose we choose a basic optimal solution to the LP relaxation of (4), denoted by x ∗tr , and round down the solution to get integral values. Let Π apx det denote the assignment suggested by the resulting integral values; and let η apx det denote the corresponding greedy static scheduling policy. For C T 3 >\nIn the remainder of the paper we provide proof sketch of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. Complete proof details as well as the proof of Corollary 1 can be found in [21].\nWe prove the right inequality in Theorem 1. The proof for the left inequality can be found in Appendix D of [21]. We ﬁrst state the following lemma which is proved in [21].\nLemma 1: C T 3 can be achieved using a greedy static scheduling policy.\nBy Lemma 1 it is sufﬁcient to prove that for any greedy static scheduling policy η g-static we have\nT 3 (η g-static ) < C det + N. \t (8) Suppose an arbitrary greedy static scheduling policy η g-static with the corresponding partition Π g-static = [I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I N ] and ordering Γ g-static \t is implemented, where {I i (1), I i (2), . . . , I i (|I i |)} is the enumeration of clients assigned to AP i according to their channel success probabilities in decreasing order. Let Y i denote the random variable indicating the number of successful deliveries by AP i during one interval, when η g-static is implemented. More precisely, Y i \t j∈I i N j (1, η g-static ), i = 1, 2, . . . , N. Then,\nwhere (a) follows from (2); (b) follows from (1); and (c) follows from LLN; since a greedy static scheduling policy is implemented and channels are i.i.d over time. Deﬁne\nLemma 2: Let τ ∈ N and G 1 , G 2 , . . . , G q be independent geometric random variables with parameters p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p q respectively, such that 1 ≥ p 1 ≥ p 2 ≥ . . . ≥ p q ≥ 0. Also deﬁne l \t max ˆl s.t. \t ˆ l i =1 1/p i ≤ τ and Y\nmax i s.t. \t i j =1 G j ≤ τ, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , q}. Then, we have E[Y ] < l + 1.\nProof: Suppose that l > 0 (for l = 0 the proof is straightforward). Without loss of generality we can omit p i \u2019s that are equal to zero. Moreover, it is sufﬁcient to prove the lemma for the case of q = τ .\nLet X l = l i =1 G i , where G i = Geom(p i ). By this notation we have\nE[Y ] = l− 1 i =0 i Pr(Y = i) + τ i =l i( τ t =l Pr(Y = i|X l = t) Pr(X l = t)) = l− 1 i =0 i Pr(Y = i) + τ t =l Pr(X l = t)( τ i =l i Pr(Y = i|X l = t)).\nSince 1 ≥ p l ≥ p l +1 ≥ . . . ≥ p τ > 0, E[Y ] is less than the case where p l = p l +1 = . . . = p τ , although l remains the same. So it is sufﬁcient to prove Theorem 1 for the case where p l = p l +1 = . . . = p τ . Then, for t ≤ τ we have\nwhere (a) follows from Pr(X l > τ ) = l− 1 i =0 Pr(Y = i); and (b) follows from τ < l +1 i =1 1 p\nwhere the last equality follows from memoryless property of geometric distribution. By substituting (12) into (11) the proof will be complete.\nwhere (a) follows from the fact that N i =1 l i is the value of the objective function in (4) for a feasible solution. Hence, by considering (9) and (13) together, the proof of the right inequality in Theorem 1 is complete.\nLet LR-RP denote the linear relaxation of RP in (4), which is obtained by relaxing the integrality constraints x ij ∈ {0, 1} to nonnegativity constraints x ij ≥ 0. Note that ﬁnding a basic optimal solution to a linear program is straightforward, and is discussed in [20]. So, let x ∗tr = [x ∗tr ij ] N ×M denote a basic optimal solution to LR-RP with objective value V ∗ ; i.e., V ∗ =\nx ∗tr ij . Deﬁne K as the number of objects that are not assigned to any of the bins (not even partially) by the solution proposed by x ∗tr . Therefore, V ∗ ≤ M − K; and by noting that C det ≤ V ∗ , we have\nMoreover, suppose that there are Z objects in the solution proposed by x ∗tr each of which is associated with at least one fractional value x ∗tr ij . Therefore,\nNow, it is sufﬁcient to show that Z ≤ N in order to complete the proof of Theorem 2. To do so, we convert RP to an instance of Min-GAP, which is formulated as following, and then use the result in [18], [19].\nThe conversion is done as following, and is similar to that of Section 3.2 in [16]. Set s ij = 1 p ij if p ij > 0, and s ij = T + 1 if p ij = 0.; set b = τ ; set c ij = 1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , N and j = 1, 2, . . . , M ; add an additional bin of capacity τ to ensure the existence of a feasible solution. For the (N + 1) st bin set s N +1,j = 0 and c N +1,j = M for j = 1, 2, . . . , M .\nLet LR-CP denote the linear relaxation of the converted problem. The following lemma, connects basic optimal solu- tions of LR-RP and LR-CP. The proof of Lemma 3 is omitted for brevity.\nLemma 3: Suppose that x ∗tr = [x ∗tr ij ] N ×M is a basic solution to LR-RP. Further, consider x ∗ = [x ∗ ij ] (N +1)×M , where\n2) ∀j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M } x ∗ N +1,j = 1 − N i =1 x ∗tr ij . Then, x ∗ is a basic solution to LR-CP.\nConsider the solution x ∗ to LR-CP with the same construc- tion as described in Lemma 3. By Lemma 3, x ∗ is a basic solution to LR-CP. Therefore, by considering the fact that there are also Z partially assigned objects in x ∗ , and using Theorem 1 of [18], [19], we get Z ≤ N. Therefore, by (16) we have C det − N i =1 M j =1 ⌊x ∗tr ij ⌋ ≤ N , and the proof of Theorem 2 is then complete.\nThe research of A. S. Avestimehr and S.
