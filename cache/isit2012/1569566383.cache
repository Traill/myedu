Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate the existence of a spectral efﬁciency upper bound that does not grow with the transmit power, when channels are estimated via pilot signals. This is because pilot-assisted channel estimation is only possible within ﬁnite cooperation clusters, resulting in out-of-cluster inter- ference that scales with the transmit power. Making the clusters excessively large can actually worsen this effect, nor does side- stepping the pilot-assisted channel estimation via noncoherent demodulation provide an escape. Using a cellular system as an example, it is demonstrated that the spectral efﬁciency saturates at power levels of operational relevance, indicating that the lackluster gains from cooperation observed in practice may be based on fundamental information-theoretic limitations, rather than current technology imperfections."},"body":{"text":"The standard information-theoretic model for communica- tion in cellular systems is the interference channel. This is justiﬁed under the assumption that each base station (BS) transmits and receives autonomously. Based on research con- ducted over the last decade [1], it is now widely believed that in future networks the performance limitations of the interfer- ence channel could be overcome through cooperation. If the BSs were to cooperate, the logic goes, the interference channel could be converted to a massive broadcast channel (BC, for the downlink) or multiple access channel (MAC, for the uplink), with all the BSs jointly decoding (MAC) or encoding (BC). At present, cooperation is somewhat constrained by the backhaul capabilities in current cellular infrastructure [2]. With ideas like cloud radio access networks, however, it seems forseeable that an arbitrary number of BSs would be able to cooperate in the future to achieve enormous spectral efﬁciency gains over the lone-BS model [3]. Based on this logic, it appears that the study of the interference channel for cellular systems is just an artifact of current technological limitations.\nIn this paper, we establish a new model for communica- tion in cellular networks. Our main insight is to show that the existence of interference whose power scales with the transmit power is inevitable in large systems, regardless of the extent of the cooperation. In particular, we show how this limitation arises with pilot-based channel estimation [4]\u2013[8],\nwhich is universally utilized in current and emerging cellular systems. The key idea is that the overhead from estimating the channel states grows with the size of the cooperation clusters, prompting the use of ﬁnite-size clusters that are subject to out- of-cluster interference. While our results assume pilot-based coherent communication, a companion paper deals with the more general case of noncoherent communication showing that, even in that case, saturation of the spectral efﬁciency is unavoidable [9].\nThe fact that the interference power should scale with the transmit power is acknowledged in [10], [11]. However, in [10] and [11] the channel gains are deterministic and thereby known perfectly\u2014at no cost\u2014by all the transmitters and receivers in the system. In our analysis, the channel gains outside the cluster of interest cannot be known and those within the cluster have to be learned. Additionally, [10] and [11] assume a speciﬁc relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio and the signal-to-interference ratio, while our approach is general in that respect.\nPilot-based explicit channel estimation is the de-facto ap- proach in modern cellular systems. A cellular system featur- ing full cooperation with pilot-based channel estimation was studied in [4], but a single isolated cluster was considered. Results for different cluster sizes were provided in [6], but the channel estimation overheads were neglected. Analysis including pilot-based channel estimation and the resulting overhead in [7] shows that, in some cases, a cooperative system indeed performs worse than an uncooperative one. While the analysis in [7] is comprehensive in several ways, a generic model capturing the key impacts is not proposed. Work in [5] and [8] considers the impact of estimation error and overhead on the performance of interference alignment (IA) in the interference channel. The authors argue that, due to estimation errors, IA should be performed in ﬁnite clusters using orthogonal signaling resources, neglecting out-of-cluster interference.\nThe traditional approach to analyzing performance in a cellular system is to study a simpler setting representing a fragment of the system. Such simpler settings are typically described (at a given time epoch) by the following relationship.\nRelationship 1 (Traditional System Model) The observation at receiver n is\nwhere K and N are the number of transmitters and receivers, respectively, X k is the signal generated by transmitter k, normalized such that P is its power, and H nk is the channel from transmitter k to receiver n. The term Z n is the noise at receiver n, typically white and Gaussian, with some normal- ized variance.\nWhile the model can be quite elaborate, for the sake of exposition we henceforth consider single-antenna transmitters and receivers such that the values in (1) are scalars.\nRelationship 1 is quite general and can be used to describe any network with K transmitters and N receivers, including the single-user channel, MAC, BC, and K-user interference channel. It has led to heralded results on the capacity of the BC and MAC [12], the deﬁnition of the number of DoF (degrees of freedom) in a network, the idea of IA [13], [14], and the concept of Network MIMO [3].\nMost work related to Relationship 1 has focused on the high-power regime, where interference becomes important. For any setting conforming to Relationship 1, the high- power behavior is as illustrated in Fig. 1. If the channel coefﬁcients {H nk } are known by the corresponding receivers and possibly also the transmitters, the spectral efﬁciency achieved by a given user grows, for P → ∞, linearly with log(P ) with a slope given by the so-called multiplexing gain. The multiplexing gain cannot exceed the number of DoF. Cooperative techniques then aim at maximizing the number of DoF available in the network, promising large gains in spectral efﬁciency through cooperation (see, e.g., [15] and references therein). In subsequent system-level simulations and\nﬁeld trials, however, these gains do not seem to materialize and the reported gains are meager, on the order of 10-20% [1], [16]\u2013[18]. The major discrepancy between theoretical predictions and observed performance raises questions as to whether Relationship 1 is the correct model for a fragment of a cellular system.\nA problem with Relationship 1 is that there are K pos- sibly cooperating transmitters and all other interference is ignored. The K cooperating transmitters are typically geo- graphic neighbors, and are referred to as a cluster. It is usually assumed that any interference from outside the cluster can be lumped into the Z n noise terms. It cannot, because Z n has a ﬁxed variance that does not depend on P whereas the out-of- cluster interference power is proportional to P . This can be resolved by modifying Relationship 1 as follows.\nRelationship 2 (Proposed System Model) The observation at receiver n is\n(2) where ˜ K and ˜ N the total numbers of transmitters and re- ceivers in the system, and K and N are the ones cooperating. Deﬁning Z n = ˜ K k =K+1 H nk X k as the out-of-cluster inter- ference at receiver n, a cluster is described by\nIn Relationship 2, as P → ∞, the out-of-cluster interference does as well if the total network size is greater than K. This gives rise to two distinct regimes for large P : (i) a DoF regime where the spectral efﬁciency scales with log P , corresponding\nto when the noise Z is small relative to P but still much larger than the out-of-cluster interference Z , and (ii) a saturation regime where the out-of-cluster interference dominates and the spectral efﬁciency no longer increases signiﬁcantly with P . The notion of DoF, and with it any standard high-power result, is only meaningful in the DoF regime, over a bounded range of P .\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, new quantities of interest emerge: the values of P at which the two transitions occur, i.e., P dof and P sat , and the limiting spectral efﬁciency, C ∞ . The values of these new quantities depend on the system topology, the channel propagation laws, and the degree of user mobility. In cases of practical interest, we will show that the transition to the saturation regime takes place within the range of operational interest and that the result is not an artifact of having K too small.\nLet G nk denote the average channel power gain resulting from distance decay, shadow fading, building penetration losses, antenna patterns, and possibly other factors, between transmitter k and receiver n. Let us further deﬁne the normal- ized channel power gains g nk = G nk / K k =1 G nk such that, for every n, K k =1 g nk = 1. Thus, g nk signiﬁes the share of receiver n\u2019s signal power that corresponds to transmitter k. The set {g nk }, for which we coin the term geometry proﬁle, provides a compact but very general representation of all the channels and channel-dependent effects in the network. Using the geometry proﬁle, we deﬁne for every receiver n a signal- to-noise ratio ( SNRn ) that scales with P and a signal-to-(out- of-cluster)-interference ratio ( SIRn ) that does not scale with P :\nwhere N 0 is the noise spectral density and B the bandwidth. If both the noise and the out-of-cluster interference are\n(6) where the signals {x k }, the channel fading coefﬁcients {h nk }, and the aggregate noise-plus-interference z n are mutually independent, Gaussian, and unit variance, i.e., N C (0, 1). It is convenient to rewrite (6) to have unit-variance noise-plus- interference giving\nFor small P , then, SINRn ≈ SNRn whereas, for P → ∞, SINRn → SIRn . The formulation on the basis of SNRn and SIRn is very general in that it captures not only the scaling with P , but also with other parameters such as cell size or noise variance.\nThe small-scale fading is modeled as Rayleigh and thus the normalized fading coefﬁcients satisfy h nk ∼ N C (0, 1). We consider a frequency-selective channel with coherence bandwidth B c and thus the value of each h nk varies from subband to subband. In terms of the temporal fading dynamics, both block- and continuous-fading are considered:\n\u2022 With block fading, the channels remain constant for L symbols and then change to a different value in an IID (independent identically distributed) fashion. If we denote by T c the channel coherence in time, then\u2014 irrespective of how the signaling is arranged along the time and frequency dimensions\u2014the number of symbols over which the channel remains coherent is L = B c T c .\n\u2022 With continuous fading, the channels within each sub- band are discrete-time stationary and ergodic random pro- cesses with a Doppler spectrum S h ( ·) that is bandlimited, i.e., such that\nfor some maximum Doppler frequency f D ≤ 1/2. In cellular channels, f D = v/(λB), where v is the velocity and λ is the carrier wavelength.\nExplicit channel estimation entails the transmission of pilot symbols regularly in time (and in frequency when multiples of B c are spanned) followed by coherent detection of payload data [19]. Note that (i) pilot symbols are overhead, and (ii) the periodicity of pilot transmission is determined by the channel coherence.\nDenote by α the share of the symbols reserved for pilots; the rest, (1 −α), is for payload data. The pilot transmissions should be orthogonally multiplexed from each of the transmitters [20] and thus the estimation of each of the K channel coefﬁcients at each receiver relies on a share α/K of the symbols. When only the kth transmitter is actively sending pilots, the SINR at receiver n is g nk SINRn and, with block fading, the MMSE on the estimation of h nk is then [19]\nK/α + g nk SINRn S h (ν) dν. (11) If the Doppler spectrum is rectangular, (11) becomes\nwhich coincides with (10) for f D = 1/(2L). The expression for the MMSE in (12) thus allows embracing both the block- and continuous fading models in a single framework.\nDenoting by ˆ h nk and ˜ h nk the estimate and estimation error for h nk , respectively, we have that h nk = ˆ h nk + ˜ h nk with ˆ h nk and ˜ h nk uncorrelated and E[ |˜h nk |] = MMSEnk . From (7)\n(13) for n = 1, . . . , N . Typically the receivers decode using the channel estimates as if they were correct, in which case the terms in the second summation play the role of additional Gaussian noise [22]. With that, the effective SINR at receiver n upon payload data detection is\nand the average spectral efﬁciency (bits/s/Hz/user) that can be attained reliably is\nwhere the function f ( ·) depends on the type of cooperation among the K = N users. The spectral efﬁciency, which vanishes for both α → 0 and α → 1, is maximized by a proper choice of 0 < α < 1.\nAs K grows, α needs to grow with it to maintain the effective SINRs. Ultimately, C is bound to peak at some cluster size and diminish thereafter. Effectively, excessively large clusters incur excessive overhead and/or poor channel estimates that ultimately nullify the beneﬁts of cooperation.\nTo provide some concrete numbers for C ∞ and P sat , we consider a cellular system with an inﬁnite number of tri- sector hexagonal cells of size R. Each sector\u2019s antenna has a uniform gain over the 120 ◦ span of the sector and a gain that is uniformly 20 dB lower outside that span. Orthogonal signaling resources (time slots and frequency bands) are allocated to the users within each sector. On any given resource there is a single user per sector and hence K = N . The user is centered in azimuth within its sector and at a distance 2R/3 from the BS. The signals experience distance-dependent decay with an exponent γ = 3.8 in addition to Rayleigh fading.\nConsider the uplink with clusters of arbitrary size K = N where the BSs fully cooperate via Network MIMO, i.e., they jointly decode the K signals received at the N sectors. Deﬁning an N × K matrix S whose entries are independent and such that the (n, k)th entry is S nk ∼ N C (0, σ 2 nk ) where\nFig. 3: Spectral efﬁciency as function of SNR for varying cluster sizes. Uplink with full cooperation.\nThe fading is either block ( L = 20, 000) or continuous with a rectangular Doppler spectrum ( f D = 2.5 × 10 −5 ), which are equivalent in terms of channel estimation and correspond to pedestrian velocities.\nFig. 3 illustrates C( SNR ) for several cluster sizes. The baseline K = N = 1 corresponds to single-user decoding, i.e., no cooperation. The case K = N = 3 corresponds to a cluster of 3 facing sectors. The case K = N = 21 corresponds to a cluster of 7 cells: one central cell plus the tier around it. The pilot overhead α is equal for all users but otherwise it is optimized to maximize C, i.e., it is optimized for every K and SNR. The performance improves going from K = 1 to K = 3 but then degrades when K increases from 3 to 21 and hence the optimum size is seen to be somewhere in-between.\nTo gauge the impact of the out-of-cluster interference at the best cluster size, we re-plot the spectral efﬁciency for K = N = 3 in Fig. 3 next to that obtained in the same exact conditions only with all the transmitters outside the cluster turned off. This comparison, presented in Fig. 4, shows that without out-of-cluster interference the traditional behavior is recovered. With it, however, the behavior is drastically different. Note that modeling the out-of-cluster interference as additional background noise of ﬁxed variance cannot ﬁx Relationship 1, as it merely would shift the spectral efﬁciency by some ﬁxed amount. Only Relationships 2\u20133 can reproduce the correct behavior.\nThe SIR that should be plugged into Relationship 3 can be found to be SIRn = 3 k =1 G nk / ∞ k =4 G nk = 9.2 dB for n = 1, 2, 3 which, indeed, corresponds with the inﬂection point observed in Fig. 3. That point, which corresponds to P sat and thus is denoted by SNRsat , delineates the transition between the DoF and the saturation regimes. The limiting spectral efﬁciency can be found to be C ∞ = 2.54 bits/s/Hz/user.\nFor user locations different from the ones chosen in this simulation, and/or with shadow fading accounted for, the SIR varies and thus the transition between the DoF and the satura- tion regimes takes place at a different SNRsat , but qualitatively speaking the behavior is unaltered. Exactly summing the out-\nFig. 4: Spectral efﬁciency as function of SNR in dB for K = N = 3. Uplink with full cooperation. In solid, with the out-of- cluster interference included. In dashed, with the out-of-cluster interference turned off.\nof-cluster interference becomes challenging in general, but the computation is otherwise conceptually identical.\nSimilar observations can be made for the downlink, by extending the pilot-based scheme in [23] to the multicell realm.\nThis paper has shown that saturation of the spectral efﬁ- ciency at sufﬁciently high SNR is unavoidable in large systems that employ pilot-based channel estimation. Consequently the spectral efﬁciency behaves as illustrated in Fig. 2 rather than Fig. 1. This does not nullify the beneﬁts of cooperation, but it indicates that cooperation has some fundamental limitations that cannot be overcome just through faster backhaul, more so- phisticated signal processing, or other technological advances. Nevertheless, in many contexts, the value of P sat should be large enough to allow signiﬁcant gains to be observed in the DoF regime. That is, cooperation can help approach C ∞ faster and, more importantly, it can increase the value of C ∞ . But the ultimate capacity is in fact bounded as a function of P .\nIt could be argued that the need for clusters is not fundamen- tal but rather a by-product of the explicit channel estimation process. If explicit channel estimation could be transcended by means of noncoherent detection, then perhaps the entire system could cooperate. In our companion work in [9] we refute this idea showing that, for K, N > L, saturation of the spectral efﬁciency is fundamentally unavoidable.\nAngel Lozano\u2019s work is supported by the European Project 265578 \u201dHIATUS\u201d.
