Through quorum sensing, each bacterium performs sensing the medium and communi- cating it to others via molecular communication. As a result, bacteria can orchestrate and act collectively and perform tasks impossible otherwise. In this paper, we consider a population of bacteria as a single node in a network. In our version of biological communication networks, such a node would communicate with one another via molecular signals. As a ﬁrst step toward such networks, this paper focuses on the study of the transfer of information to the population (i.e., the node) by stimulating it with a concentration of special type of a molecules signal. These molecules trigger a chain of processes inside each bacteria that results in a ﬁnal output in the form of light or ﬂuorescence. Each stage in the process adds noise to the signal carried to the next stage. Our objective is to measure (compute) the maximum amount of information that we can transfer to the node. This can be viewed as the collective sensing capacity of the node. The molecular concentration, which carries the information, is the input to the node, which should be estimated by observing the produced light as the output of the node (i.e., the entire popu- lation of bacteria forming the node. The molecules are trapped in the bacteria receptors forming complexes inside the bacteria which affect the genes responsible for producing the light. We focus on the noise caused by the random process of trapping molecules at the receptors as well as the variation of outputs of different bacteria in the node. The optimal input distribution to maximize the mutual information between the output of the node, e.g., light, and the applied molecule concentration is derived. Further, the capacity variation with the number of bacteria in the node and the number of receptors per bacteria is obtained. Finally, we investigated the collective sensing capability of the node when a speciﬁc form of molecular signaling concentration (which resembles M-ary modulation) is used. The achievable sensing capacity and the corresponding error probabilities were obtained for such practical signaling techniques."},"body":{"text":"The idea of exploiting a colony of bacteria to perform a desired task has been the subject of research in various biological disciplines and new designs have recently attracted the attention of researchers in the information theory and network engineering areas. The basic idea behind such net- works is adaptation and engineering of speciﬁc types of bac- teria that are capable of sensing, computation, actuation, and above all, communication with each other [1]. The existence of a form of communication using molecules that occurs naturally among bacteria has been conﬁrmed [1]. Such a communication enables single cells to gather and process sensory information about their environment and evaluate and\nreact to chemical stimuli. One phenomenon that in particu- lar demonstrates the essential components of communication among cells is \u201cQuorum Sensing\u201d [1], [2]. Quorum Sensing can be viewed as a decentralized coordination process which allows bacteria to estimate the density of their population in the environment and regulate their behavior accordingly. To estimate the local population density, bacteria release speciﬁc signaling molecules. These signal molecules will then reach the neighboring bacteria providing them with information about other bacteria in the environment. As the local density of bacteria increases, so will the concentration of the molecules in the medium. Bacteria have molecule receptors that can estimate the molecular concentration and thus the bacteria population density. Bacteria use quorum sensing to coordinate energy expensive actions that cannot be carried out by a single bacterium. This process, captures most of the important components of a molecular communication system.\nNew designs are constantly emerging from manipulation of quorum sensing bacteria\u2019s DNA. The encoding, sending, and releasing information using living organisms as carriers of data is studied in [3]. The design of biological clocks using quorum sensing is introduced in [4]. A model for forming a network via molecular communication is given in [5]. These studies have inspired researchers to investigate the communication among bacteria more carefully and also pay attention to information theoretical aspects of bacteria communication.\nIn [6] we studied a discrete noiseless molecular communi- cation channel inspired by diffusion process in the medium where living organisms dwell in. The information is assumed to be encoded in the alteration of concentration of molecules in the medium. In [7], we presented models to account for the reception process of molecules in a single bacterial receiver. In [8], we introduced the Molecular Communication Networking (MCN) paradigm where a population of bacteria (i.e., the primitive agents) that are clustered together form the node of a communication network. Such node is considered to be an independent entity and act as a fairly smart node in the network. The information is transferred from one node to another through diffusion of molecules in the medium. The agents in each node coordinate their actions via quorum sensing process. The agents in a node sense the concentration of molecules at steady-state and responds accordingly. This setup enables us to take advantage of primitive agents in a network that is designed to perform a speciﬁc task and transfer information. Motivated by the network framework in [8], in the present paper, we wish to compute the collective sensing capacity of each such node. We should also mention that there\nexists another line of research which relies on the assumption that information is encoded in the timing of emission of molecules that tries to answer analytical questions concerning the communication in nano-scale through that lens [9], [10].\nThe output of quorum sensing process can be in various forms, for example, the bacteria can emit light or produce Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) which can be used to convey information to the outside world. In this paper, our goal is to quantify the maximum amount of information that a population of bacteria can convey, through luminescence or ﬂuorescence, given a constant concentration of molecules as its input. This can then be used to design signaling schemes for engineering bacteria communication networks such as the one in [8]. We consider a population of bacteria (i.e., a node) that is stimulated with a slow varying concentration of molecules. The output of the node, in the form of light or GFP, is measured to estimate (i.e., to decode the information) the concentration of molecules at the vicinity of the node. We use a probabilistic model to account for discrepancy in behavior of individual bacteria. We obtain the optimal distribution on input concentration (i.e., the signal) that results in maximum mutual information between the input and output (i.e., the maximum sensing capacity). In addition, we present a signaling technique and obtain the resulting sensing capacity of the node versus the corresponding error rate.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the problem setup using the related works in biology and bio-networks. Sec. III discusses the analysis of the capacity of concentration sensing and Sec. IV introduces a practical signal technique that can be used to achieve a certain error rate.\nIn our previous work [8], we introduced a molecular communication network consisting of nodes which contain n bacteria. The information is conveyed in the network from one node to another through alternation of concentration of Acyl Homoserine-Lactone (AHL) molecules A surrounding the nodes. Note that the random variable A represents the concentration. This concentration is sensed by the bacteria in the node such that each bacterium emits light or GFP with the intensity that depends on A. Fig. 1(a) shows a bacterium used in such a node. The plasmid contains the information (genes) about production of light and can be added to a bacterium that does not naturally emit light. Each node is a fairly smart unit that can measure the total output (e.g., in the form of light) of the bacteria population residing in the unit and coordinate their action to alter the concentration of molecular signals (by emitting new molecules to the medium). Note that, in general, a node can sense the concentration of one molecule type and emit to the medium another type of molecular signal (i.e., decode and forward the information to the next node without interference between the input and the output of a node). By this architecture, we form a reliable node out of collection of unreliable bacteria.\nBy measuring the output of bacteria (which as mentioned before is in the form of light or GFP), the node is able to\nestimate the concentration of molecules and hence, decode the information. The number of differentiable levels of input and the error in decoding to the right level limit the amount of information that can be transferred to the node (i.e., sensed by the node). In this setup, one of the fundamental problems is the maximum amount of information that can be transferred to a node and the way it can be achieved. It is important to note that molecular communication networks has very slow dynamics. This is because 1. the molecular diffusion, in the channel connecting two nodes, is very slow, and 2. the chemical processes inside the bacteria are time consuming. Therefore, information delivery from one node to another occurs in a slow pace. Hence, we can assume that molecular signal A varies slowly in time. Therefore, we can assume that the concentration of molecules surrounding a node is constant for sufﬁcient amount of time, allowing the decoding of the information by the node. Hence, we focus on a receiving node and compute the sensing capacity of a constant concentration of molecules around the node. The setup is consistent with the analysis of the capacity for continuous channels, in which we sample the signal and measure the capacity per sample (rather than per seconds). Finally, note that throughout this paper, we focus on the receiver end and do not study the rate constraints (in bits per seconds) due to the (bandwidth of the) diffusion channel. That is why we referred to the maximum information rate (in bits per sample) as the sensing capacity.\nThe response of various strands of bacteria to different levels of inter-cellular AHL molecule concentrations has been studied extensively and mathematical models for the chain of chemical reactions it causes inside the bacterium is provided. In [11], a model consisting of a chain of linear differential equations is introduced to account for the process of luminescence or ﬂuorescence in response to presence of AHL molecules in the medium. These equations capture the average dynamic behavior of bacteria and also their steady- state behavior. They account for three main stages in the process: 1) binding of AHL molecules to the cell receptors, 2) production of the AHL+LuxR complex and transcription of genes responsible for production of light or GFP and ﬁnally, 3) light emission or GFP production. These three stages are shown in Fig. 1(b). The differential equation accounting for probability of binding of molecules to the cell receptors is given by [11]:\nwhere A is the concentration of molecules, γ is the input gain and κ is the dissociation rate of trapped molecules in the cell receptors. Here, ˙p is the derivative of p with respect to time. In this model, each cell receptor (i.e., the ligand receptor) is activated with a probability that depends on the concentration of molecules in the medium surrounding the cell. This probability starts to increase from the moment a constant concentration is applied until it takes its ﬁnal steady-state value p 0 , given by\nwhere Y i , (i.e., Y i = N j=1 Y ij ) is the output of bacterium i. Using the conditional expectation, we have\nwhere the last equality comes from the fact that the noise has zero mean. Hence, for the output deﬁned in (6), we have E(Y)=nN p 0 . By using conditional variance, we have\nV ar (Y i ) = E(V ar(Y i |p i )) + V ar(E(Y i |p i )) = E(N p i (1 − p i )) + V ar(N p i )\nThe ﬁrst term in (8) is due to general uncertainty in a Binomial output and the second one is due to noise in the parameter p i . By independence assumption between the output of different bacteria, the variance of the output is equal to\nSince the number of receptors N per bacterium is usually large enough, the second term is dominating. Hence, we can approximate the variance by nN 2 σ 2 p 2 0 (1 − p 0 ) 2 .\nNote that Y can take nN + 1 different levels which results in a trivial upper bound of log 2 (nN + 1) for the mutual information between A and Y . In order to make the analysis of the capacity tractable, we approximate the output in (6) with a Normal random variable. Since the number of receptors N is large, we can use the Central Limit Theorem and approximate Y i by N (N p 0 , σ 2 Y i ) where σ 2 Y i is given in (8). Hence, the output Y will be the sum of n Normal variables given by\nwhere the noise ǫ Y ∼ N (0, σ 2 Y ). The ﬁrst term in (10) can be considered as the signal to be decoded by the node and the second term is an additive Gaussian noise which has a signal-dependent variance. In order to calculate the sensing capacity, we should obtain the optimized distribution of p 0 which maximizes I (p 0 ; Y ) the mutual information between the input and output, which in turn gives the optimized distribution for A through (2).\nTo proceed, we observe that, in practice, A cannot take any values and the maximum achievable concentration is\nA max which maps to probability p max via (2). This maximum probability is an indicator of the maximum power used by the transmitter to emit the molecules into the medium. By using more power, the transmitter can increase the maximum concentration of molecules at the vicinity of the receiver node and increase p max . We obtain the optimized distribution for p 0 over the interval [0 p max ] and calculate the capacity based on p max . We assume p max to be greater than 1 2 .\nThe structure of noise in (10) is complicated since the noise variance depends on the signal itself. Hence, we use the numerical method of Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BA) in order to obtain the optimal input distribution and its corresponding capacity. Note that due to above approximations, it will give us the approximated sensing capacity. As we can see in (9), the noise power is at its maximum at p 0 = 1 2 and goes to zero when p 0 approaches to either zero or one. Hence, we expect that the distribution of p 0 should take values close to 0 and p max with a higher probability. The results from the algorithm conﬁrms this fact and the distribution has local maximums at 0 and p max .\nResults for the capacity (in bits per sample) with respect to p max for different values of σ 2 0 is shown in Fig. 2. In this setup, we have chosen N = n = 30. As we observe from the plot, the capacity increases when we either increase p max or decrease σ 2 0 . Note that the maximum achievable capacity is limited even if the transmitter used inﬁnite power to make p max = 1. Here, we have assumed σ 2 0 to be nonzero but even in the case that σ 2 0 = 0, the capacity is limited. This is because of the ﬁrst term in the variance of noise in (9) which does not depend on σ 0 and is caused by binomial nature of the reception process. Note that in practice, N and n are very large. However due to the exponential growth of the simulation time with respect to N or n, we only computed the capacity for small values of N and n.\nFig. 3 shows the capacity versus p max for different values of n the number of bacteria in the population, and N the number of receptors per bacterium. Here, σ 2 0 is considered to be 0.1 during the simulation. As we observe from the plot, by increasing n or N , the capacity increases but the effect of n is more signiﬁcant. The reason for that can be explained by (9) and (10). The input signal increases linearly with both n and\nN but the variance of the noise increases quadratically with N and linearly with n.\nIn the previous section, the capacity was obtained with the assumption that A (and hence p 0 ) is a continuous variable between 0 and A max . In other words, it was assumed that any concentration of molecules can be achieved by the transmitter at the vicinity of the node. In practice, a discrete number of levels of concentration of molecules can be achieved which results in discrete levels of p 0 .\nIn this section, we consider a speciﬁc signaling method (i.e., modulation) and study the modulations of input signal that achieve speciﬁc error rates and compute its achievable information rate. The range of the input is determined by p max at the receptors. The number of levels of concentration and different choices for those levels introduce different ways of modulation of information. In essence, given k, the number of input signal levels, we have to ﬁnd the best k levels to choose from the interval [0 p max ] and their corresponding weights in order to minimize the error of transmission. Since the variance of the error in the output varies for different inputs, the ideal analysis as described above will be cumbersome and actually not practical. This is because of the complexity that it enforces on the transmitter, which is assumed to be simple. Here, we use a rather simple but effective modulation of the input signal in which the k levels are chosen uniformly from the interval [0 p max ] and symbols are assumed to be equi- probable. The probability of error can be reduced by increasing the transmission power which in turn increases p max . Again we assume p max to be always greater than 1 2 .\nThe most trivial modulation corresponds to k = 2 in which symbols p 0 = 0 and p 0 = p max are transmitted with equal probability. Ideally if the transmitter is able to make p max = 1, we can achieve the data rate of 1 with error probability of zero. This is because the symbols 0 and 1 do not make any noise in the receiver (see (5)). Hence, zero error can be achieved in a binary transmitter with power approaching to inﬁnity.\nWe consider a hard decision scenario in decoding the symbols. In other words, the receiver chooses the closest symbol to the received one. We obtain the error probabilities p e versus p max as shown in Fig. 4 for different modulations. The results are given for n = N = 30 and σ 2 0 = 0.1. The probability of error for k = 2 is practically zero even for ﬁnite power. We can conclude from Fig. 4, that the communication is not reliable as k increases. For example, for the case of k = 32, the probability of error cannot become less than 0.2. However, by increasing N and n, for any k, the scheme becomes a practical modulation. The experiment is not plotted due to page limit. Note that p e decreases as p max increases but it cannot be made arbitrarily small for a modulation with large k, unless n and N are large.\nIn this paper, we studied the transfer of information to a pop- ulation of bacteria by stimulating them with a concentration of\nmolecules. The output can be in the form of light or GFP and contains a noise from the process of trapping of the molecules and the variation in bacteria responses. the power can be accounted for by the maximum achieved concentration at the receiver. The optimal input distribution and the corresponding capacity were obtained based on the received power. Finally, we introduced practical modulations that achieve a speciﬁc data rate and error probability."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"B. L.
