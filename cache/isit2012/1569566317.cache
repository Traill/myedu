Under the assumption of full visibility, this reduces to studying connectivity in the so- called random K-out graph H(n; K); here n is the number of nodes and K < n is an integer parameter affecting the number of keys stored at each node. We show that if K ≥ 2 (resp. K = 1), the probability that H(n; K) is a connected graph approaches 1 (resp. 0) as n goes to inﬁnity. This is done by establishing an explicitly computable lower bound on the probability of connectivity. From this bound we conclude that with K ≥ 2, the connectivity of the network can already be guaranteed by a relatively small number of sensors with very high probability. This corrects an earlier analysis based on a heuristic transfer of classical connectivity results for Erd˝os-R´enyi graphs.\nKeywords: Random graphs, Connectivity, Zero-one laws, Wireless sensor networks."},"body":{"text":"Random key predistribution is one of the approaches pro- posed in the literature for addressing security challenges in resource-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The idea of randomly assigning secure keys to the sensor nodes prior to network deployment was ﬁrst introduced by Es- chenauer and Gligor [5]. Following their original work, a large number of key predistribution schemes have been proposed; see the survey articles [2], [15], [16], [17].\nHere we consider the random pairwise key predistribution scheme proposed by Chan et al. in [3]: Before deployment, each of the n sensor nodes is paired (ofﬂine) with K dis- tinct nodes which are randomly selected from amongst all other nodes. For each sensor and any sensor paired to it, a unique (pairwise) key is generated and stored in their memory modules along with their ids. A secure link can then be established between two communicating nodes if at least one of them is paired to the other so that the two nodes have at least one pairwise key in common. Precise implementation details are given in Section II. The random pairwise predistribution scheme has a number of advantages over the scheme of Eschenauer and Gligor: (i) Even if some nodes are captured, the secrecy of the remaining nodes is perfectly preserved; (ii) Unlike earlier schemes, the pairwise\nscheme enables both node-to-node authentication and quorum- based node revocation.\nLet H(n; K) denote the undirected random graph on the vertex set {1, . . . , n} where distinct nodes i and j are adjacent if they have a pairwise key in common as described earlier; this random graph models the random pairwise predistribution scheme under full visibility (whereby all nodes are within wireless communication with each other). We seek conditions on n and K under which H(n; K) is a connected graph with very high probability as n grows large. As in the case of the Eschenauer-Gligor scheme, such conditions may provide guidelines for dimensioning purposes (although they are possibly too optimistic given the full visibility assumption used).\nWe report on the following zero-one law for connectivity in H(n; K): With K ≥ 2 (resp. K = 1), the probability that H(n; K) is a connected graph approaches 1 (resp. 0) as n grows large. This is done by establishing a computable lower bound on the probability of connectivity for each K ≥ 2. Applying this lower bound with K = 2 we see that for n = 20, the graph is connected with probability larger than 0.98, whereas with only 50 sensors, this probability of connectivity becomes larger than 0.999. Thus, connectivity is already achievable with high probability under very small values of K and n. These values are much smaller than the ones implied by a heuristic transfer of classical connectivity results from Erd˝os-R´enyi graphs (as was done in the original paper of Chan et al. [3] and in [8]). The results obtained here correct misleading predictions made in these earlier papers, and form the basis for a reappraisal of the scalability of the random pairwise predistribution scheme; see [19], [22] for details.\nThe random graph H(n; K) is known in the literature on random graphs as the random K-out graph [1], [6], [13]. Fenner and Frieze [6, Thm. 2.1, p. 348] have established the zero-one law given here by a completely different approach which focuses on the vertex and edge connectivity parameters. While their analysis also leads to a lower bound on the probability of connectivity, the lower bound obtained here is sharper than theirs for K ≥ 3.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we give a formal model for the random pairwise predistribution scheme of Chan et al., and introduce the induced random K-out graph.\nThe main results of the paper concerning the connectivity of random K-out graphs are presented in Section III; there we also compare them against the earlier results of Fenner and Frieze. Various comments are given in Section IV. Proofs are omitted due to space limitations but can be found in [23].\nAll statements involving limits, including asymptotic equiv- alences, are understood with n going to inﬁnity. The cardinal- ity of any discrete set S is denoted by |S|.\nThe random pairwise key predistribution scheme of Chan et al. is parametrized by two positive integers n and K such that K < n. There are n nodes which are labelled i = 1, . . . , n with unique ids Id 1 , . . . , Id n . Write N := {1, . . . n} and set N −i := N − {i} for each i = 1, . . . , n. With node i we associate a subset Γ n,i (K) of nodes selected at random from N −i \u2013 Each of the nodes in Γ n,i (K) is said to be paired to node i. Speciﬁcally, for any subset A ⊆ N −i , we require\n \nThus, the selection of Γ n,i (K) is done uniformly amongst all subsets of N −i which are of size exactly K. The rvs Γ n,1 (K), . . . , Γ n,n (K) are assumed to be mutually indepen- dent so that\nfor arbitrary A 1 , . . . , A n subsets of N −1 , . . . , N −n , respec- tively.\nOnce this ofﬂine random pairing has been created, we con- struct the key rings Σ n,1 (K), . . . , Σ n,n (K), one for each node, as follows: Assumed available is a collection of nK distinct cryptographic keys {ω i| , i = 1, . . . , n; = 1, . . . , K}. These keys are drawn from a very large pool of keys; in practice the pool size is assumed to be much larger than nK, and can be safely taken to be inﬁnite for the purpose of our discussion.\nNow, ﬁx i = 1, . . . , n and let n,i : Γ n,i (K) → {1, . . . , K} denote a labeling of Γ n,i (K). For each node j in Γ n,i (K) paired to i, the cryptographic key ω i| n,i (j) is associated with j. For instance, if the random set Γ n,i (K) is realized as {j 1 , . . . , j K } with 1 ≤ j 1 < . . . < j K ≤ n, then an obvious labeling consists in n,i (j k ) = k for each k = 1, . . . , K with key ω i|k associated with node j k . Of course other labeling are possible. e.g., according to decreasing labels or according to a random permutation. Finally, the pairwise key\nis constructed and inserted in the memory modules of both nodes i and j. Inherent to this construction is the fact that the key ω n,ij is assigned exclusively to the pair of nodes i and j,\nhence the terminology pairwise predistribution scheme. The key ring Σ n,i (K) of node i is the set\nΣ n,i (K) \t (1) = {ω n,ij , j ∈ Γ n,i (K)} ∪ {ω n,ji , i ∈ Γ n,j (K)}.\nAs mentioned earlier, under full visibility, two nodes, say i and j, can establish a secure link if at least one of the events i ∈ Γ n,j (K) or j ∈ Γ n,j (K) takes place. Both events can take place, in which case the memory modules of node i and j both contain the distinct keys ω n,ij and ω n,ji . By construction this scheme supports node-to-node authentication.\nUnder full visibility the pairwise predistribution scheme naturally gives rise to the following class of random graphs: With n = 2, 3, . . . and positive integer K < n, the distinct nodes i and j are said to be adjacent, written i ∼ j, if and only if they have at least one key in common in their key rings. Thus, with the notation (1), we have\nLet H(n; K) denote the undirected random graph on the vertex set {1, . . . , n} induced by the adjacency notion (2). In the literature on random graphs, the random graph H(n; K) is usually referred to as a random K-out graph [1], [6], [13].\nFurthermore, let λ(n; K) denote the probability of edge as- signment (between any two nodes) in H(n; K). Under the enforced independence assumptions, it is plain from (2) that\nOur main technical result is given next; its proof, given in [23], adapts classical arguments used for proving the one-law for connectivity in Erd˝os-R´enyi graphs [4, Section 3.4.2, p. 42].\nThe bound (5) gives some indication as to how fast the convergence lim n→∞ P (n; K) = 1 occurs when K ≥ 2, with the convergence becoming faster with larger K as would be expected; see also (7) below. Although the right handside of (5) may be negative for small values of n (in which case the bound is trivial), it is already positive when n = 2(K + 1) (hence also past n(K)).\nFor each n = 2, 3, . . ., a simple coupling argument yields the comparison\n \nThe one-law in Theorem 3.2 is an easy consequence of the bound (5), while the zero-law of Theorem 3.2 is proved separately in [23]. Theorem 3.2 easily yields the behavior of graph connectivity as the parameter K is scaled with n, but ﬁrst some terminology: We refer to any mapping K : N 0 → N 0 as a scaling whenever it satisﬁes the natural conditions\nRelated results have appeared earlier: Fix n = 2, 3, . . . and consider a positive integer K < n. We deﬁne the vertex connectivity C v (n; K) of H(n; K) as the minimum number of its vertices whose deletion disconnects H(n; K). The edge connectivity C e (n; K) is deﬁned similarly in terms of edges. Fenner and Frieze have established the following result in terms of these quantities [6, Thm. 2.1, p. 348].\nThe one-law in Theorem 3.2 is immediate from either (11) or (12) since H(n; K) is connected if either C v (n; K) ≥ 1 or C e (n; K) ≥ 1. The zero-law in Theorem 3.2 coincides with (13), and was obtained in [6] with the help of results by Katz [11] concerning random mappings. In [23] we give a com- pletely different proof for (13); it uses classical enumeration results for the set of undirected graphs on n nodes which are connected and have exactly n edges [7, p. 133-134].\nInspection of the proof of Theorem 3.4 given in [6, Thm. 2.1, p. 348] yields the lower bound\nfor any positive integers n and K such that K < n, where we have set\nThis follows from Eqn. 2.2 in [6, p. 349] with p = 0; note that the parameter K used here is denoted m in [6].\nThe lower bound (14) has the same form as the one given in Theorem 3.1, but is weaker (i.e., is a smaller lower bound) than (5) except for K = 2. Indeed it is easy to check that\nIn order to better understand how these lower bounds compare with each other, observe that\nThus, the lower bound given in Theorem 3.1 for the probability of network connectivity approaches one much faster than the bound (14) inferred from [6]. To illustrate this fact, with n = 50 we have plotted the behavior of a(K), b(K) and b(n; K) with respect to K in Figure 1. As expected from the remarks above, a(K) approaches zero much faster (in fact exponentially fast) than b(n; K) as K increases. Although K = 2 is already enough to ensure connectivity with high probability, in a realistic WSN setting, we expect K to\ntake larger values in order to accommodate other network requirements and to ensure connectivity under severe channel conditions [21].\nFor each p in [0, 1] and n = 2, 3, . . ., let G(n; p) denote the Erd˝os-R´enyi graph on the vertex set {1, . . . , n} with edge probability p. While edge assignments are mutually indepen- dent in G(n; p), they are strongly correlated in H(n; K) in that they are negatively associated in the sense of Joag-Dev and Proschan [10]; see [18], [21] for details. Thus, H(n; K) cannot be equated with G(n; p) even when the parameters p and K are selected so that the edge assignment probabilities in these two graphs coincide, say λ(n; K) = p. As a result, neither Theorem 3.1 nor Corollary 3.3 are consequences of classical results for Erd˝os-Renyi graphs [1]. See also the discussion in Section IV-C.\nTo drive the point further, note the following: In many known classes of random graphs, the absence of isolated nodes and graph connectivity are asymptotically equivalent properties, e.g., Erd˝os-R´enyi graphs [1], [4], geometric random graphs [12] and random key graphs [14], [18], [20]. This equivalence, when it holds, is exploited by ﬁrst establishing the zero-one law for the absence of isolated nodes, a step which is usually much simpler to complete with the help of the method of ﬁrst and second moments [9, p. 55]. However, there are no isolated nodes in H(n; K) since each node is of degree at least K. Thus, the class of random graphs studied here provides an example where graph connectivity and the absence of isolated nodes are not asymptotically equivalent properties; in fact this\nis what makes the proof of the zero-law (given in [23]) more intricate.\nIn the original paper of Chan et al. [3] (as in the refer- ence [8]), the connectivity of H(n; K) was analyzed through the following two-step process: (i) First, the random graph H(n; K) was equated with an Erd ˝ os-R´enyi graph so that the edge assignment probabilities are asymptotically equivalent; (ii) Then, classical connectivity results for Erd˝os-R´enyi graphs were formally transferred to H(n; K) under this constraint.\nWe revisit this transfer argument in some details: First, there is no loss of generality in writing any scaling p : N 0 → [0, 1] for the edge assignment probability in Erd˝os-R´enyi graphs in the form\nfor some deviation sequence α : N 0 → R. Also, recall [1] that the property of graph connectivity admits the zero-one law\n \nIt is tempting to use this result as follows: A given scaling K : N 0 → N 0 is said to be asymptotically matched to a scaling p : N 0 → [0, 1] for Erd˝os-R´enyi graphs provided λ(n; K n ) ∼ p n . This ensures that the expected degrees (per node) in the random graphs G(n; p n ) and H(n; K n ) are asymptotically equivalent. In view of (3) this requirement amounts to\nIf the scaling p : N 0 → [0, 1] is put in the form (15) for some deviation sequence α : N 0 → R, then (17) becomes\nWith this identiﬁcation, one might expect the random graphs G(n; p n ) and H(n; K n ) to behave in tandem, at least asymp- totically, and by analogy the following zero-one law\n \nshould then hold by a formal transfer of (16). This approach, though appealing for its simplicity, leads to incorrect conclu- sions as we now show.\nIndeed, consider a scaling K : N 0 → N 0 such that K n = K for some positive integer K for all n sufﬁciently large. On that range, the requirement (18) leads to the corresponding deviation function α : N 0 → R being given by\nfor some sequence t : N 0 → R + with lim n→∞ t n = 1. Thus, we have lim n→∞ α n = −∞ regardless of the value of K , and according to (19) we would conclude that lim n→∞ P (n; K ) = 0 for all positive integers K , in clear contradiction with Theorem 3.2.\nWe could also have used a weaker version of the zero-one law (16) which considers scalings p : N 0 → [0, 1] of the form\n \nunder (20), and a formal transfer of (21) suggests the validity of the zero-one law\n \nIn particular, we read off from (23) that K n should behave like γ log n with γ > 1 2 (resp. γ < 1 2 ) in order for H(n; K n ) to be connected (resp. disconnected) with a probability approaching 1 for n large. Not only does this conclusion fall short of the result given in Corollary 3.3, but it also leads to incorrect design decisions: For instance, the maximum supportable network size evaluated in [3], [8] leads to the conclusion that the random pairwise key predistribution scheme is not scalable in the context of WSNs. The results given here form the basis for a reevaluation of these conclusions; see [19], [22] for details.\nThis work was supported by NSF Grant CCF-0729093.
