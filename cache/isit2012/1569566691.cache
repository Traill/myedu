In these models one or more source nodes communicate with one or more destination nodes with the help of intermediate relay nodes. Relay network models are of relevance in wireless sensor networks where the sensor nodes have limited transmission power capabilities and com- munication range. In this work we study a special type of relay network called the diamond network or parallel relay network, introduced by Schein and Gallager [1]. We focus on the Gaussian case, in which the transmitted signals are real and subject to an average power constraint, and the received signals are affected by channel attenuation and additive white Gaussian noise.\nDespite the simplicity of the model, its capacity, that is, the maximum reliable communication rate from source to destination, is in general unknown. The best known capacity upper bound is based on the cut-set bound. Many com- munication strategies have been proposed, such as decode- and-forward (DF), compress-and-forward (CF), amplify-and- forward (AF), bursty-amplify-and-forward (BAF), rematch- and-forward (RF), and combinations thereof, leading to var- ious capacity lower bounds. Progress has been made in the characterization of capacity by establishing the gap, either additive or multiplicative, between the lower and upper bounds [2], [3], [5]. Some of these characterizations apply to a general class single-source multicast networks and can be sharpened for the special case of symmetric diamond networks.\nIn this work we focus on the low SNR regime. The capacity of the Gaussian relay channel (i.e. single relay network) has\nbeen studied in [6] for low SNR via a minimum energy-per-bit formulation. This work also establishes a relationship between the minimum energy-per-bit and capacity, and characterizes the minimum energy-per-bit within a constant factor. The slow-fading Gaussian relay channel at low SNR has been studied in [7] for low outage probability, where it is shown that the BAF scheme (see below) is optimal and achieves the outage capacity for certain parameter ranges.\nWe propose a new communication scheme tailored to the low SNR regime which we denote binary-superposition- partially-decode-and-forward (BSPDF). We generate a binary codebook (i.e. with symbols chosen from {0, 1}) of sparse binary patterns, and encode part of the source message through the selection of a codeword from this codebook. The remaining part of the source message is encoded through an independent codeword with Gaussian symbols, transmitted in the symbol positions where the binary codeword has ones. The relays then decode the binary codeword and amplify the received signal only in the time indices where the binary codeword has ones. Finally the destination jointly decodes both codewords. We ob- serve that BSPDF leverages the beneﬁts of BAF of increasing the symbol SNR to avoid excessive noise ampliﬁcation, while achieving a larger rate by conveying information through the binary codeword.\nWe characterize the rates that can be achieved with the BSPDF scheme, and analyze its performance in the asymptotic regime of SNR → 0 for symmetric diamond networks. Our results show that our new communication scheme matches or exceeds the performance of all previously known communica- tion schemes in this asymptotic regime. We use the achievable rate of BSPDF at low SNR to compute an upper bound on the minimum energy-per-bit for the symmetric diamond network. We show that the worst-case ratio of this upper bound to the cut-set lower bound on the energy-per-bit is 1.87, improving on the worst case ratios obtained with DF and BAF, which are 2 and 2.85 respectively.\nWhile not explicitly discussed in this paper, it is possible to improve the performance of other communication schemes (e.g. CF, partial-decode-and-forward, etc.) by combining them with the underlying ideas of BSPDF, i.e. increasing the symbol SNR by communicating with small-duty-cycle signals and encoding additional information in the binary codeword.\nx n , and its t th element is expressed as x[t]. Differential entropy and mutual information are denoted by h and I and are expressed in bits. ln and log 2 are used for natural and base-2 logarithms respectively. Probability and expectation are denoted by Pr and E. A Gaussian distribution with mean μ and variance σ 2 is denoted by N (μ, σ 2 ).\nWe consider a diamond network consisting of a source node S, two relay nodes Relay i , i = 1, 2, and a destination node D (cf. Fig. 1).\nWe denote by X S [t] and X i [t] the signals transmitted by the source and relay i = 1, 2 at discrete time t respectively. We assume the average power of the transmitted signals to be upper bounded by P S and P r , i.e. for a large block of n symbols 1 n n t=1 E(X S [t] 2 ) P S and 1 n n t=1 E(X i [t] 2 )\nP r for i = 1, 2. We denote by √g i ∈ R + the channel gain from the source to relay i and by\ni ∈ R + the channel gain from relay i to the destination, noting that there is no loss of generality in considering non-negative channel gains. In the symmetric diamond network that we consider, g 1 = g 2 = g and h 1 = h 2 = h. We normalize the channel by choosing P S = P r = 1 and absorbing the values of the power constraints in the channel gains g and h. The received signal at relay i = 1, 2, Y i and the received signal at the destination, Y D , are given by Y i [t] = √gX S [t] + Z i [t] and Y D [t] = 2 i=1 √ hX i [t] + Z D [t] where Z 1 [t], Z 2 [t] and Z D [t] are independent identically distributed random variables with distribution N (0, 1).\nThe source communicates to the destination a message W that is uniformly distributed in the set {1, 2, . . . , M}. A (2 nR , n) code for the diamond network consists of a set of integers M = {1, 2, . . . , 2 nR } with 2 nR = M, called the message set and the following encoding and decoding functions. The source uses an encoding function Enc S : {1, 2, . . . , M} → R n to map any message W ∈ M into a vector (X S [1], . . . , X S [n]) = Enc S (W ). At time t relay i maps the input signals {Y i [1], . . . , Y i [t − 1]} into an output signal X i [t] using an encoding function Enc t−1 R i : R t−1 → R for i = 1, 2 and t = 1, . . . , n. The decoder outputs an estimate\nof the transmitted message ˆ W = Dec(Y D [1], . . . , Y D [n]) using the decoding function Dec : R n → {1, 2, . . . , M}.\nThe average probability of error is deﬁned as the probability that the decoder\u2019s estimate ˆ W is not equal to the transmitted message W , and is given by\nThe rate R is said to be achievable for the diamond relay network if there exists a sequence of (2 nR , n) codes with the transmitted signals satisfying the power constraints such that P (n) e tends to zero as n tends to inﬁnity. Similarly, an energy- per-bit E is achievable if there exist a sequence of (2 nR , n) codes such that ( 2 nR t=1 X S [t] 2 + X 1 [t] 2 + X 2 [t] 2 )/nR tends to E with vanishing error probability as n tends to inﬁnity.\nIn this subsection we obtain the rates achievable with DF and BAF which will be baselines for comparing the performance of the proposed scheme BSPDF.\nIn DF each relay must decode the message transmitted by the source node. As a result, the achievable rate cannot exceed the capacity of the point-to-point channel from the source to each relay. In addition, since both relays decode the transmitted message, they can beamform their transmissions to the destination. The achievable rate cannot exceed the capacity of the multiple-input single-output (MISO) point-to- point channel from the relays to the destination. Combining both rate constraints we obtain\nIn BAF the source and relays transmit only during a fraction δ of the time, staying silent during the remaining channel uses. This allows to increase the transmission power at the source and relays by a factor 1/δ while still satisfying the average power constraints. Relay i ampliﬁes the received signal by a factor γ i and transmits the signal to destination. The ampliﬁ- cation factor at relay i, γ i , must satisfy γ i 1/(δ +g i ). In the symmetric channel, the optimal choice is γ 1 = γ 2 = 1/(δ+g). Since the channel is only used a fraction δ of time, which can be optimized, the resulting achievable rate of the BAF scheme is\nThe general cut-set capacity upper bound [4] can be spe- cialized to the symmetric diamond network as follows.\nC (SR) = 1 2 log 2 (1 + g) 1 + h 1 − ρ 2 C (D) = 1 2 log 2 (1 + 2h(1 + ρ)) .\nThe BSPDF communication scheme that we propose is a generalization of DF, AF, and BAF. In the BAF scheme, the bursts occur in predetermined time intervals, and no information is carried in the timing of the bursts. Our BSPDF scheme is inspired by the observation that it is possible to encode information in the burst position as long as the relays and destination can identify the position of the bursts. The relays need to determine the burst position in order to know when to amplify the received signal and when to remain silent.\nIt is not necessary to transmit in bursts. The effective SNR of AF can be increased by transmitting sparse or low duty cycle signals. In the BSPDF scheme we create these signals by generating a binary codebook C 1 with random i.i.d. codewords u 1,i 1 with Bernoulli (δ) symbols, and for each of these codewords u 1,i 1 generating a random codebook C 2,i 1 with codewords u 2,i 1 ,i 2 with symbols distributed as N (0, 1/δ) for the time indices where u 1,i 1 [t] = 1 and with constant value 0 for the time indices where u 1,i 1 [t] = 0. The source transmits a message indexed by (i 1 , i 2 ) by transmitting u 2,i 1 ,i 2 . Then the relays attempt to decode the binary codeword u 1,i 1 and amplify the received signal only in the time indices t where u 1,i 1 [t] = 1, using appropriate gains to satisfy the power constraints. Finally the receiver attempts to decode both u 1,i 1 and u 2,i 1 ,i 2 generating an estimate (ˆi 1 ,ˆi 2 ).\nThe following theorem establishes the rates that can be achieved with the BSPDF scheme.\nTheorem 1. Let U be a random variable with Bernoulli(δ) distribution and let X S be a random variable with conditional distribution X S |{U = 1} ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) and X S |{U = 0} having a mass point at 0 with probability 1, where 0 < δ < 1 and σ 2 δ < 1. For i = 1, 2, let Y i = √gX S + Z i , where Z i ∼ N (0, 1) independent over i. Finally, let Y D = √ hκU(Y 1 + Y 2 ) + Z D , where δκ(gσ 2 + 1) < 1, and Z D ∼ N (0, 1) independent of everything else. Then, the rate R = R 1 + R 2 is achievable in the symmetric diamond network if\nR 1 < I(U; Y i ), i = 1, 2, R 2 < I(X S ; Y D |U)\nRemark 1. Theorem 1 can be generalized to non-symmetric diamond networks, with more than 2 relays, and to other distributions for U and X S [8].\nProof: (Sketch) We communicate over b + 1 blocks of length n each. In the ﬁrst block, the source sends a message in {1, . . . , 2 nR } which is received by both relays. The relays remain silent during this ﬁrst block. In block m, 1 < m b,\nthe source encodes a new message in {1, . . . , 2 nR } which is received by both relays, while the relays encode signals based on the signals received in block m − 1. Finally, in block b + 1 the source remains silent while the relays encode signals based on the signals received in block b. Assuming that the destination successfully decodes all the messages, the communication rate is Rb/(b + 1) for large n, which tends to R as b → ∞. We next describe and analyze the coding scheme used in each block of length n. To simplify notation, we use index t to represent the time index in block m for the signal transmitted at the source and received at the relays, and the time index in block m + 1 for the signal transmitted by the relays and received at the destination, for m = 1, . . . , b.\nCode construction: We generate a codebook C 1 with 2 nR 1 random i.i.d. codewords chosen according to the distribution of U. For each u n 1,i 1 ∈ C 1 , we generate a codebook C 2,i 1 with 2 nR 2 codewords with symbols u 2,i 1 ,i 2 [t] chosen independently according the distribution of X S |U = u 1,i 1 [t].\nEach message W ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M} is represented by a pair (i 1 , i 2 ). The source transmits message (i 1 , i 2 ) by sending the codeword u n 2,i 1 ,i 2 ∈ C 2,i 1 . That is,\nRelay processing: At the end of each block m ∈ {1, . . . , b}, relay i attempts to decode the codeword u n 1,i 1 . Decoding consists of ﬁnding the unique codeword u n 1,ˆi 1 in codebook C 1 that is jointly typical with Y n i , declaring an error if it ﬁnds zero or more than one such codewords.\nRelay i encodes the signal to be sent in transmission block m + 1 based on the received signal Y n i and the decoded codeword u n 1,ˆi 1 in block m for t = 1, . . . , n as follows,\nDecoding at the destination: The destination attempts to decode the codewords u n 1,i 1 and u n 2,i 1 ,i 2 from the received signal in each block Y n D using joint typicality decoding. Decoding consists of ﬁnding the unique pair (u n 1,ˆi 1 , u n 2,ˆi 1 ,ˆi 2 ) in C 1 × C 2,ˆi 1 that are jointly typical with Y n D , declaring an error if it ﬁnds zero or more than one such pairs. The decoded message in each block is given by Dec (Y n D ) = (ˆi 1 ,ˆi 2 ).\nAnalysis of the probability of error: We ﬁnd the av- erage probability of error over all the random code con- structions. Due to the symmetry of the random code con- struction, the conditional probability of error is independent of the transmitted messages, i.e. P (n) e = Pr{Dec(Y n D ) = (1, 1) | message (1, 1) was sent}, and without loss of gener- ality we assume that u n 2,1,1 has been sent.\nThere is an error whenever some relay or the destination declares an error. For any given block, relay i = 1, 2 declares an error if the correct codewords u n 1,1 is not jointly typical with Y n i , or if an incorrect codeword u n 1,i 1 is jointly typical with Y n i for some i 1 = 1. Similarly, the destination declares an error if the correct codewords {u n 1,1 , u n 2,1,1 } are not jointly typical with Y n D , or if incorrect codewords {u n 1,i 1 , u n 2,i 1 ,i 2 } are jointly typical with Y n D for some (i 1 , i 2 ) = (1, 1).\nIn addition, we declare an error if the average power of the transmitted signal at the source is larger than one, or if the average power of the transmitted signal at some relay is larger than one. This is done to make sure that the power constraints at the source and relays are satisﬁed.\nUsing the union bound, the law of large numbers, and standard properties of jointly typical sets and jointly typical sequences we can bound the probability of error at the relays and destination by:\nwhere can be made arbitrarily small when n → ∞. When the conditions of the theorem are satisﬁed we can make the average probability of error of the coding scheme, which is averaged over all the random codebooks, arbitrarily small for n large enough. Therefore, there exists a sequence of codebooks with average probability of error going to zero as n tends to inﬁnity. As a result, the rate R = R 1 + R 2 is achievable.\nTheorem 1 provides explicit expressions of achievable rates for the BSPDF communication scheme. However, ﬁnding the maximum achievable communication rate requires computing differential entropies of mixtures of Gaussian random variables and optimizing over the parameters δ, σ 2 , and κ. To simplify the numerical computations and to gain more insight into the low SNR regime we consider an asymptotic regime where the channel gains tend to zero while maintaining a constant ratio among them. Since in this regime the channel capacity goes to zero, we measure performance by the ratio of the achievable rates and some reference channel gain. Due to our channel normalization, this asymptotic regime is equivalent to making P S = P r = P → 0 in the unnormalized channel while keeping the channel gains ﬁxed, measuring performance by the ratio between the achievable rate and some constant times P .\nIn the asymptotic regime that we consider, the optimal duty cycle δ of the signals transmitted by the source and relays with BSPDF tends to zero. In this case, the mixtures of Gaussian distributions that are required in the evaluation of the information quantities of Theorem 1 have a main component occurring with probability (1 −δ) and a secondary component occurring with probability δ. For small δ, the differential entropy of these mixtures can be approximated using a Taylor series expansion as stated in the following Lemma (see [8] for a proof).\nLemma 1. Let the probability distribution of the random variable Y be mixture of Gaussian distributions f Y (y) = (1 − δ) e −y 2 /(2σ 2 0 ) /( √ 2πσ 0 ) + δ e −y 2 /(2σ 2 1 ) /( √ 2πσ 1 ), where 0 < δ < 1. For small δ we can write the differential entropy of Y as h(Y ) = 1 2 log 2 (2πeσ 2 0 )+δ(σ 2 1 /σ 2 0 −1)/(2 ln 2)+O(δ 2 ).\nLemma 1 allows us to approximate the information expres- sions appearing in Theorem 1 as follows.\nCorollary 1. Let U ∼ Bernoulli(δ) and Y have conditional distribution Y |U = 0 ∼ N (0, σ 2 0 ) and Y |U = 1 ∼ N (0, σ 2 1 ). Then for small δ we have,\nUsing this low SNR approximation for the information quantities appearing in Theorem 1 we obtain the following theorem that characterizes the performance of BSPDF in the low SNR asymptotic regime.\nTheorem 2. For a symmetric diamond network let α = g/h. The rate |h|R BSPDF (α) + O(h 2 ) bits per network use is achievable, where R BSPDF (α) is the solution of the following optimization problem.\n√ αβ 2 ln 2\nβ(2 + α + √ αβ) \t (4) Proof: Due to Theorem 1 we are able to achieve any rate\nR 1 < I(U; Y i ) for i = 1, 2, R 1 < I(U; Y D )\n√ gh with 0 < δ < 1, σ 2 = (1 − )/δ and κ = 1/(g + δ) for some = o(h 2 ). Let σ 2 r = √\nα(1 − )/β + 1. Conditioned on U = 1, the random variable Y i has distribution N (0, σ 2 r ) for i = 1, 2, and conditioned on U = 0 we have Y i ∼ N (0, 1) for i = 1, 2. Thus, by Corollary 1\nfor i = 1, 2, where we absorbed the terms depending on in the O(h 2 ) term.\n√ α(1− )/(β(α+β √ α))+2/(α+β √ α)+ 1, we have that conditioned on U = 1, Y D ∼ N (0, σ 2 D ) and conditioned on U = 0, Y D ∼ N (0, 1). Therefore, using Co- rollary 1\n− ln 1 + 4 √ α/(β(α + β √ α)) + 2/(α + β √ α) + O(h 2 )\nwhere, as before, we absorbed the terms depending on in the O(h 2 ) term.\n1 + 2/(α + β √ α) + O(h 2 ) After some simpliﬁcation the theorem follows.\nWe have numerically solved the optimization for R BSPDF (α) for various values of h/g. The results are plotted in Fig. 2 together with the achievable rates of DF, BAF, and the cut-set upper bound. It follows from Fig. 2 that BSPDF outperforms both DF and BAF in the low SNR regime. It also follows from the ﬁgure that for a certain range of h/g timesharing different BSPDF schemes results in higher rates. This suggests that generalizing BSPDF to more than two power levels (i.e. {0, P }) to select the codeword symbols in the C 2,i 1 may lead to better performance (see [8] for this generalization and corresponding performance improvements).\nIn this section, we use the results of Section IV to compute upper and lower bounds on the minimum energy-per-bit for the symmetric diamond network. An extension of the result in [6] shows that the minimum energy-per-bit of the diamond network can be characterized as\nwhere C(P, ρP ) represents the capacity of the symmetric diamond network with average power constraint P on the source node and ρP on the relay nodes.\nWe can get a lower bound on E b by upper bounding C(P, ρP ) in (5) using the cut-set upper bound in (3). In addition, we can ﬁnd an upper bound on the minimum energy- per-bit of the diamond network by lower bounding the capacity in (5) with the achievable rate of any communication scheme. For example, we can use the capacity lower bounds of DF (1) and BAF (2) to derive upper bounds on E b .\nSince the results of Section IV assume a normalized chan- nel, we need to scale R BSPDF (α) appropriately in Theorem 2 to get an upper bound for (5). We need to set the normalized channel gains as ˜g = P g and ˜h = ρP h, obtaining α = ˜g/˜h = g/(ρh), C |˜h|R BSPDF (α)+O(h 2 ) = ρP hR BSPDF (g/(ρh))+\n(g/(ρh)) . \t (6) The ratio of the upper and lower bounds on E b for different\nvalues of h/g are plotted in Figure 3 for DF, BAF, and BSPDF. For BAF, the ratio tends to one if h \t g or g \t h, with a worst case value of approximately 2.85 when these gains are comparable. In DF the lower and upper bounds on E b coincide when h/g 1/2. However, the ratio between the upper and lower bounds approaches 2 when h/g → ∞. The BSPDF communication scheme outperforms both BAF and DF schemes with respect to the minimum energy-per-bit for all values of h/g. The worst-case ratio of the upper and lower bounds on E b for the BSPDF scheme is 1.87."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"B. E.
