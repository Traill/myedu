Two main models are studied: the case where the actions depend only on the messages, and the case where the actions can depend also on past values of the state. The latter model is referred to as actions with feedback. When the actions depend only on the messages, the full capacity region is derived. We then show that if the channel is physically degraded, then dependence of the actions on past values of the state does not increase its capacity region. We further demonstrate by an example that if the channel is stochastically degraded, action feedback can increase its capacity region. This situation resembles previous results on feedback in regular (state-independent) broadcast channels.\nIndex Terms\u2014Action-dependent states; broadcast chan- nel; causal side information; feedback; Shannon strategies."},"body":{"text":"Let A, S, X , Y, and Z be ﬁnite sets, and let A n stand for the set of all n-sequences of letters from A. An element (a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n ) of A n is denoted by a n , with substrigs written as a j i = (a i , . . . , a j ). When the dimension n is clear from the context, boldface letters are used to denote n-vectors, thus a stands for a n . Random variables are written by capital letters, with similar convention for random vectors: A n , Y j i , A etc. For two jointly distributed random variables A and S, we denote by P A , P A,S , and P S|A the probability mass function (PMF) of A, their joint PMF, and the conditional PMF of S given A. A memoryless broad- cast channel with action dependent states is a septuple\nalphabet, S the state space, P S|A a conditional PMF from the action alphabet to the state space, X the channel input alphabet, Y and Z the channel output alphabets, and P Y,Z|S,X a conditional PMF from S × X to Y × Z. As a shorthand, and when the choice of the alphabets and P S|A is clear, we will refer to the broadcast channel just as P Y,Z|S,X . Both the channel from action to state and that from state and channel input to channel outputs are assumed memoryless.\nFor notational convenience, the dimension in the PMF notation will sometimes be omitted. Thus P S n |A n (s n |a n ) and P Y n ,Z n |S n ,X n (y n , z n |s n , x n ) will be denoted by P S|A (s|a) and P Y,Z|S,X (y, z|s, x), respectively, and similarly for other tuples.\nAs in [6], we consider a vector cost function, of dimension d ≥ 1, that takes into account input and action costs. Thus, let\nbe a single letter (vector-valued) cost function. The cost associated with vector of actions a and a channel input word x is\nLet Λ k (a, x), 1 ≤ k ≤ d, denote the kth coordi- nate of Λ(a, x). We denote the sets of messages by N k = {1, 2, . . . , ν k }, k = 1, 2, where ν 1 and ν 2 are two integers. A coding scheme for the broadcast channel with action dependent states available causally at the encoder operates as follows. A vector of actions A n = α(M 1 , M 2 ) is selected by the encoder based on the messages M 1 and M 2 which are drawn randomly from N 1 and N 2 , respectively. A random state vector S n is now generated as the output of the memoryless channel P S|A with the action sequence A n at its input. The encoder observes the state sequence in a causal manner and selects the channel input based on it and\nthe pair of messages. We give next a formal deﬁnition of the coding scheme described above.\nDeﬁnition 1. An (n, ν 1 , ν 2 , λ, ) code for the broadcast channel P Y,Z|S,X with action dependent states known causally at the encoder is an action mapping\ng y : Y n → N 1 g z : Z n → N 2\nsuch that the average input costs are bounded by λ k E[Λ k (A(M 1 , M 2 ), f (S, M 1 , M 2 ))] ≤ λ k ,\nwhere g −1 y (m 1 ) ⊂ Y n and g −1 z (m 2 ) ⊂ Z n stand for the decoding sets of the messages m 1 and m 2 , respectively, and where\n(5) The rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) of the code is\nA cost-rates triple (λ, R 1 , R 2 ) is said to be achiev- able if for every > 0 and sufﬁciently large n there exists an (n, 2 nR 1 , 2 nR 2 , λ, ) code for the broadcast channel P Y,Z|S,X with causal action dependent states. The capacity-cost region for the channel is the closure of the set of all achievable cost-rates triples, and is denoted by C c . For a given vector λ of input costs, C c (λ) stands for the section of C c at λ.\nP e ≤ P e,z + P e,y \t (6) where\nand where P Y |S,X and P Z|S,X are the conditional marginals derived from P Y,Z|S,X . Therefore, the capacity region depends on P Y,Z|S,X only via its conditional marginals P Y |S,X and P Z|S,X .\nWe use in the sequel the notion of degradedness as deﬁned in [5]. A broadcast channel P Y,Z|S,X is said to be physically degraded if there exists a conditional PMF P Z|Y such that\nin which case Z is said to be the degraded component. A state dependent broadcast channel is said to be stochas- tically degraded if\nfor some conditional PMF P Z|Y (z|y). As in the case where no actions are present [5], the capacity of the degraded broadcast channel with action-dependent states depends on the conditional PMF P Y,Z|S,X only via its marginals P Y |S,X and P Z|S,X . Therefore, no distinc- tion has to be made between physically degraded and stochastically degraded channels, and they will be termed degraded broadcast channels.\nWe are interested in the characterization of the capacity-cost region C c of the degraded broadcast chan- nel with action dependent states. 1 Let P be the set of all random variables (A, K, U, S, X, Y, Z) such that K and U take values in ﬁnite sets K and U , respectively, the size of which will be speciﬁed later, and\n(9) Denote by R c the set of all costs and rates (λ, R 1 , R 2 ) such that\nR 1 ≤ I(U ; Y |K) \t (10a) R 2 ≤ I(K; Z) \t (10b)\nfor some P A,K,U,S,X,Y,Z ∈ P. Note that the region R c remains unchanged if we replace (10a) with the constraint\nsince, on one hand, I(U ; Y |K) ≤ I(U, A; Y |K), and on the other hand, we can always deﬁne a new external random variable ˜ U = (U, A), which satisﬁes (9) and reduces (11) to (10a). The next proposition states a few properties of R c .\n2) To exhaust R c , it is enough to restrict P A|K,U and P X|A,K,U,S to be 0 − 1 laws\n3) To exhaust R c , it is enough to restrict K and U to satisfy\nThe proof is similar to the proof of [5, Proposition 4] and is omitted. We proceed to state our main result.\nTheorem 1. For any discrete memoryless degraded broadcast channel with action-dependent states known causally at the encoder\nThe proof is given in Section IV. Due to space consid- erations, we will give only the proof of the converse part. We note here that this result was derived independently in [1].\nIt is possible to express R c in terms of Shannon strategies [4], as was done in [5, eq. (33)], with the difference that in the current setting we have to take the random actions A into account. Denote by T the family of all Shannon strategies, i.e., mappings from S to X :\nWe denote by T a random mapping taking values in T , and P T its distribution. Let V be the set of all extended strategies deﬁned as pairs (a, t) with a ∈ A and t ∈ T , and let P V be a distribution on V. That is, V is a random extended strategy V = (A, T ).\nWe will now hinge on Proposition 1 and (11) to characterize R c in terms of extended strategies. Due to Proposition 1 we can write\nX = ˜ φ 2 (A, K, U, S) = ˜ φ 2 (φ 1 (K, U ), K, U, S) = φ 2 (K, U, S)\nfor some deterministic functions φ 1 and φ 2 . Therefore, for ﬁxed (k, u), φ 2 (k, u, ·) ∈ T . We will refer to the random mapping φ 2 (U, K, ·) as T . For ﬁxed k, a conditional distribution P U |K (·|k) induces a conditional distribution on T , P T |K (·|k). By (9), and the fact the T is a deterministic function of (K, U ), the following Markov relations hold\n(K, U ) − −(A, T, S) − −Y \t (12) (K, U, T ) − −A − −S \t (13)\nwhere (a) is true because T is a deterministic function of (U, K), and (b) holds due to (13). This proves (14). Since A and T are deterministic functions of (U, K), (14) implies\nwhere we identiﬁed V as the random extended strategy (A, T ). Therefore, R c can be characterized also as the set of all costs-rates triples (λ, R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying\nR 1 ≤ I(V ; Y |K) \t (17a) R 2 ≤ I(K; Z) \t (17b)\nwhere V is an extended strategy, and S and K are independent given V .\nA natural extension of the model of Section II is the case where the actions chosen by the encoder depend not only on the messages, but also on past values of the generated state, that is, A i = A i (M 1 , M 2 , S i−1 ). This model is interpreted as actions with feedback from the state sequence to the actions encoder. It is shown in [6]\nthat for the single user channel with action dependent states known causally at the encoder, feedback from the states does not increase capacity. The same question for the non-causal case remains open.\nIn [3] El Gamal proved that the capacity region of the memoryless physically degraded broadcast channel is not enlarged by feedback. Dueck [2] demonstrated, via examples, that partial (i.e., one sided) feedback can increase the capacity regions of two-way channels and general broadcast channels. Speciﬁcally, the example that Dueck constructed for the broadcast channel is a stochastically degraded one, thus emphasizing that when feedback is present one has to distinguish between physically and stochastically degraded models.\nIn this section we examine the broadcast channel with causal side information and actions feedback. We show that for this class of channels, the situation is parallel to the case of regular broadcast channels with feedback: dependence of the actions on past values of the state does not increase the capacity region of degraded broadcast channels, but it can increase the capacity region of a stochastically degraded (and hence also the general) broadcast channel. The deﬁnition of an (n, ν 1 , ν 2 , λ, ) code remains as in Deﬁnition 1, except that the action mapping (1) is replaced by a sequence of mappings:\nthe costs (3) now depend on the state also via the actions A:\nk = 1, 2, . . . , d, \t (19) and P S|A (s|α(m 1 , m 2 )) in the probability of error (4) is replaced by\n(20) where we use the notation\nα 3 (s 2 , m 1 , m 2 ), . . . , α n (s n−1 , m 1 , m 2 ) . \t (21) We have the following result\nTheorem 2. The capacity region of the physically de- graded broadcast channel with action-dependent states known causally at the encoder is not increased if the actions depend on past values of the states.\nFor a proof, see the proof of the converse part of The- orem 1.\nIf the channel is not physically degraded, then allow- ing the actions to depend on past values of the state can increase the capacity region. This is demonstrated in the next example, which follows Dueck\u2019s example [2].\nExample 1. We ﬁrst deﬁne the channel from the actions to the state. Let A = A 0 × A 1 × A 2 and S = S 0 × S 1 , where A i = S j = {0, 1} for i = 0, 1, 2 and j = 0, 1. Let V be a binary (1/2, 1/2) random variable, independent of the actions. The state S is deﬁned as:\nBoth outputs, Y and Z, are independent of X. Moreover, since Z 0 = Y 0 and V is binary (1/2, 1/2), the output Z is stochastically degraded with respect to Y . Since the outputs are independent of the input, messages are encoded only via the actions. Therefore the actions play the role of the input in a broadcast channel without states or actions. By (22) and (23), there is one noiseless channel from the action A 0 to the outputs (Y 0 , Z 0 ). The channels from A 1 to Y 1 , and from A 2 to Z 1 , are useless in the absence of state feedback, and the sum rate cannot exceed 1. However, when the actions depend on past values of S = (S 0 , S 1 ), at time i the encoder learns V i from S 1,i and sends it to both receivers via A 0,i+1 in the next time epoch. This results in two clean binary channels, and the point (R 1 , R 2 ) = (1, 1) is achievable.\nWe start with a sequence of codes with increasing blocklength and vanishing probability of error. Denote by M 1 and M 2 the messages intended to user Y and user Z, respectively. To prove the converse of Theorem 1, we can assume that the channel is physically degraded. Starting from the Fano inequality, we have\nwhere the last equality is true since the channel is physically degraded. Deﬁne the random variables\nS i − −A i − −(U i , K i ) \t (29) (A i , K i , U i ) − −(X i , S i ) − −(Y i , Z i ) \t (30)\nDue to the convexity of R c , the converse now follows after using the standard time sharing argument, and taking the limit n → ∞.\nWe note here that the same arguments hold also in the case where the action A i depends on past values of the state, that is, A i = A i (M 1 , M 2 , S i−1 ), therefore proving theorem 2 for the physically degraded broadcast channel."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"B.
