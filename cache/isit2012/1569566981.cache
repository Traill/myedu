Oftentimes, both users wish to acquire some common channel state information (CSI), such as the gain of a time- division duplex (TDD) fading channel. This bidirectional channel estimation problem is conventionally divided into two one-way estimation problems, where, in each direction, the sender transmits deterministic pilots to assist the receiver.\nThis paper poses some fundamental questions: Is it optimal to separate the bidirectional channel estimation problem into two one-way problems? Can a user adapt its signaling to the information already acquired to better assist the other user?\nTo answer these questions in a novel view, we study two concrete models. The ﬁrst model involves a bidirectional chan- nel where the common multiplicative channel coefﬁcient takes two possible values. It is shown in a simple case that a smaller probability of estimation error is achievable at one user by using adaptive pilots than using predetermined (deterministic) pilots from the other user. The second model is a bidirectional Gaussian channel where both users are subjected to a common colored interference. The goal is for each user to estimate the common interference by linearly ﬁltering its received signals. To assist the other user, each user applies a scaling of the most recent received symbol as the adaptive pilot. With optimized scaling and linear estimators, the mean square error (MSE) achieved by the bidirectional estimation scheme is shown to be substantially smaller than that achieved by separate one- way estimation. Although the preceding models are motivated by two-way wireless channels with fading and/or interference,\nthey are not intended to be accurate. Rather, the simple models allow a simple analysis to illustrate the potential beneﬁts of adapting pilots for channels where reciprocity applies.\nThe bidirectional estimation strategy studied in this paper is motivated in part by the bidirectional training schemes proposed in [1] and [2]. There the users take turns transmitting pilots in each direction to estimate beamformers and receive ﬁlters directly. Two-way training schemes for estimating CSI at one end were previously presented in [3], [4], [5], [6]. In [7], multiple round protocols implemented by power control could achieve a diversity-multiplexity tradeoff. A very recent paper [8] studies simply combining training and quantized feedback to acquire CSI at transmitter in a TDD system.\nThe bidirectional channels studied in this paper resemble the two-way channels studied by Shannon [9] and subsequent authors [10], [11]. That work, however, has mainly been concerned with the capacity trade-off between the two users instead of the problem of estimating some common channel state.\nIn this section, we use a simple model to demonstrate that treating a bidirectional channel estimation problem as two separate one-way estimation problems is in general not optimal. The model involves two users communicating through a bidirectional discrete-time half-duplex fading channel with complex-valued state H. When user 1 transmits signal X t during symbol interval t, user 2 receives\nand when user 2 transmits signal X τ during symbol interval τ , user 1 receives\nwhere {N τ } and {N t } are independent noise processes con- sisting of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) stan- dard circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) random variables. It is assumed that both users are subject to average transmit power constraint. Evidently, if only user 1 wishes to estimate the channel coefﬁcient H, it is optimal to let user 2 transmit a constant symbol. If both users wish to estimate the channel, it is usually treated as two separate estimation problems: The two users take turns to transmit constant pilots to assist the other user to estimate the channel.\nDoes it help to adapt the pilot to one\u2019s knowledge about the channel? To answer this question, consider a special case\nwhere H is equally likely to be 1 and j = e j π 2 . If user 1 sends constant 1, then user 2 receives Y t = H + N t , so that to estimate H is to test between two hypotheses 1 and j in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The square distance (per symbol) between the two hypotheses is |1 − j| 2 = 2, which determines the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Suppose for a moment user 1 knows H (or has perfect estimate), so that user 1 can send H itself as the pilot. Then user 2 receives Y t = H 2 + N t , where H · H = H 2 is equally likely to be ±1. User 2 still carries out hypothesis testing, whereas the SNR doubles because the square distance between the two hypotheses increases to 4.\nIt is, however, not always beneﬁcial to use adaptive pilots. For example, if H in (1) and (2) is equally likely to be 0 and 1, then it is optimal to transmit constant pilots, because using adaptive pilots does not improve the average square distance between the two hypotheses.\nIf a user\u2019s knowledge about the channel state is imprecise, is it still beneﬁcial to use adaptive pilots? We answer this question by assuming two channel uses only, one by each user, with maximum signal power s 2 . Let user 1 send a pilot symbol s so that user 2 estimates the channel by testing the two hypotheses s and js. The error probability of user 2 is P e = P { ˆ H = H} = Q s √ 2 where Q(x) = 1 √ 2π ∞ x e −x 2 /2 dx.\nSuppose user 2 next sends X = s if ˆ H = 1; otherwise user 2 sends X = se jθ for some θ ∈ [0, π) to be optimized shortly. Then signal HX takes four possible values depending on (H, ˆ H ): {s, se jθ , js, jse jθ }. As shown in Fig. 1, these four points are symmetric about line OB. The optimal decision rule is simple: If the received signal Y of user 1 falls to the left of line OB, then the estimate is ˆ H = j; otherwise ˆ H = 1. It is easy to show that the error probability of user 1 is:\nThe parameter θ should be chosen to minimize (3). By setting the derivative of (3) with respect to θ to 0, the optimal choice of θ is found by solving\nFig. 2 plots the error probability of user 1 achieved by the two schemes against the SNR of the pilots. The results illustrate that the simple bidirectional scheme outperforms one-way estimation.\nIn this section, we study bidirectional estimation in a Gaus- sian channel with colored additive interference. All signals are real-valued. When user 1 transmits signal X t during symbol interval t, user 2 receives\nand when user 2 transmits signal X τ during symbol interval τ , user 1 receives\nwhere {N t } and {N t } are i.i.d. standard Gaussian processes. The colored interference {H t } is a wide-sense stationary process with zero mean and covariance\nwhere 1 β ∈ (0, 1]. 2 The processes {N t }, {N t } and {H t } are independent. Assume that both users are subject to maximum amplitude constraint: |X t | ≤ s max and |X t | ≤ s max for all t.\nWe shall consider both full- and half-duplex modes of the channel. The full-duplex mode models the situation where the users simultaneously inject two symbols X t and X t at the two ends of the channel during interval t and receive Y t and Y t , respectively. The interference H t to both users is identical, while the noise components N t and N t are different, because they are introduced at the respective receiving ends. The physical model suggests that the received signal should also contain one\u2019s own transmitted signal. Such (known) self- interference is assumed to be canceled to yield (5) and (6).\nThe half-duplex mode models the situation where a user cannot receive any useful signal during its own transmission, so that the users should not transmit at the same time. In case of half-duplex transmission, it is further assumed that user 1 transmits during odd intervals and user 2 transmits during even intervals in this section.\nWe restrict our attention to linear estimators. If all random processes involved are Gaussian, the optimal estimator is often linear.\nWe ﬁrst study the performance achieved by separate one- way channel estimation. The optimal linear estimators in the mean-square sense can be viewed as a Kalman ﬁlter. We ﬁrst consider the full-duplex mode. Since constant pilots are inconsequential here, it sufﬁces to assume X t = X t = 0 at all time. The received signal of user 1 is thus Y t = H t + N t . In steady state, or, equivalently, when {H t } is wide-sense stationary, the minimum causal MSE f is the unique positive root of the second-order polynomial equation [12]:\nThe problem of one-way estimation in the half-duplex mode is similar, except that one can use only every other received symbol. The steady-state performance is the same as that of the full-duplex mode with reduced covariance. That is, the minimum causal MSE h is the unique positive root of equation (9) with β replaced by β 2 .\nWe now allow users to coordinate and adapt pilots to their respective received signals. For simplicity, we ﬁrst consider memoryless processing. That is, the estimate of the current interference as well as the pilot to be transmitted in the next interval only depends on the most recent received symbol.\nWe assume half-duplex channel in this subsection. The memoryless scheme is described as follows: Suppose user 2 receives Y t−1 during interval t − 1, where t is an even number. During interval t, user 2 transmits pilot\nand user 1 receives signal Y t = X t + H t + N t and produces an estimate of the interference as\nand user 2 receives Y t+1 = X t+1 +H t+1 +N t+1 and produces an estimate\nThe problem here is to select deterministic numbers {a t , b t } to minimize the mean squared error of the interference estimates, where it is assumed that the power of the transmitted symbols\nsatisﬁes the following constraints: E X 2 t ≤ (s max ) 2 and E (X t ) 2 ≤ (s max ) 2 for some constant s max > 0.\nLet the correlation coefﬁcient of any two random variables U and V be denoted by ρ(U, V ). The minimum MSE at time t achieved by any linear estimation is expressed as:\nb t = E {Y t H t }/E Y 2 t \t (15) in (11). Evidently, minimizing the MSE is equivalent to maximizing the correlation coefﬁcient ρ(Y t , H t ). That is, the more correlated are the received signal and the interference, the better the interference can be estimated.\nWe determine {a t , b t } next. Since the expected value of the pilots are inconsequential, we assume E {X t } = E {X t } = 0. For convenience, we let ρ t denote the correlation coefﬁcient of the current pilot and interference:\nand let s t denote the standard deviation of the current pilot, i.e., we have\n= ρ t s t σ + σ 2 . \t (20) Given ρ t , the pilot power s 2 t should be chosen to maximize ρ(Y t , H t ) by solving the following optimization problem:\ns 2 t + σ 2 + 1 + 2ρ t s t σ \t (21) subject to s t ≤ s max . \t (22)\n) , s max \t (23) so that\n \nIt is easy to see that (23) applies to both even and odd t. Moreover, in order for the pilot power to be s 2 t , the ampliﬁer a t should be determined based on (10) as\nAll parameters can be derived sequentially as follows: At the beginning of time t = 0, before any observation is made, we have ρ 0 = 0. Hence the optimal s 0 = 0, so the pilot can be chosen as X 0 = 0 with a 0 = 0 and b 0 = σ 2 /(1 + σ 2 ). In general, given ρ t , we can obtain the optimal s t from (23) and subsequently determine (a t , b t ) as well as ρ(Y t , H t ). The preceding process can be repeated in the subsequent symbol interval, because once ρ(Y t , H t ) is determined from (21), we can obtain\nρ t+1 = ρ(X t+1 , H t+1 ) \t (27) = β ρ(X t+1 , H t ) \t (28) = β ρ(Y t , H t ) \t (29)\nIt is straightforward to evaluate the steady-state perfor- mance, which can be regarded as the limit of t → ∞. It is expected that\nfor some constant ρ.

The differ- ence is that each user produces an estimate of the interference using the most recent received symbol during every symbol interval. The details are omitted here due to space limitations.\nThe performance of memoryless bidirectional estimation is demonstrated by simulation results at the end of this section.\nIn this subsection, we seek the optimal linear causal estima- tion at the receivers assuming that the pilots are still generated using the most recent received symbol in a memoryless manner. We study the steady-state performance for brevity. It is enough to assume that all pilot and received signal processes are deﬁned for all integer values of time t and stationary. Suppose user 1 receives a symbol during interval t, then user 1 estimates the interference as\nwhere (c 0 , c 1 , . . . ) represents the coefﬁcients of a causal ﬁlter. In the subsequent interval, user 1 transmits a pilot\nWe ﬁrst consider the full-duplex mode in this subsection. It sufﬁces to discuss the performance of user 1 according to the symmetric model. For every interval t, the signals are described by (5), (6), (35) and (36). Due to the orthogonality condition of optimal linear ﬁltering [12], we have, for all l ≤ t\nY t+2 = X t+2 + H t+2 + N t+2 \t (40) = a(X t+1 + H t+1 + N t+1 ) + H t+2 + N t+2 (41) = a 2 Y t + aH t+1 + aN t+1 + H t+2 + N t+2 . \t (42)\n= E {[a(aY t−1 + H t + N t ) + H t+1 + N t+1 ]Y l } \t (44) = a 2 E {Y t−1 Y l } + (a + β)E {H t Y l } . \t (45)\nBy substituting (39), (43) and (45) into (46) and peeling off two leading terms of the sum, we obtain\nBoth (38) and (48) could be treated as sets of linear equations.

With (49)\u2013(51), we have\nwhere we have used (42) to write (53). Thus, from (8) and (53) the estimation error in steady state is calculated as follows,\nwhere we use the fact that the current estimation error is uncorrelated with future noise samples. From (55), we have\nLet s 2 t = E X 2 t . From (21), (26) and (29), it is not difﬁcult to verify that\nGiven the maximum average power s 2 max , the optimal c 0 , c 1 , and a should be chosen to minimize by solving the following optimization problem:\nminimize (56) \t (58) subject to s 2 t ≤ s 2 max \t (59)\nOnce c 0 and c 1 are determined, all the remaining coefﬁcients can be calculated according to (49)\u2013(51).\nThe case of half-duplex causal estimation and memoryless pilots can be derived in a similar manner as the full-duplex case. The details are omitted here due to space limitations.\nWe compare the numerical performance of bidirectional channel estimation with that of separate one-way channel estimation in steady state. We assume the interference power σ 2 = 3 and the pilot power does not exceed s 2 max = 5. The MSE achieved by different estimations are plotted against the coefﬁcient β of the Gauss-Markov interference process in Fig. 3. In both full-duplex and half-duplex modes, using optimal causal linear estimators and memoryless pilots outperforms\nseparate one-way estimation. Even if only memoryless esti- mators are allowed, bidirectional estimation also outperforms one-way estimation in full-duplex mode if β ≤ 0.90, and in half-duplex mode if β ≤ 0.98. It is interesting to note that despite memoryless processing at each end, the bidirec- tional scheme introduces memory into the overall estimation procedure. Moreover, in the half-duplex mode, the one-way estimation only has access to every other output symbol, whereas the bidirectional estimation is inﬂuenced by output symbols at both ends either directly or indirectly."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
