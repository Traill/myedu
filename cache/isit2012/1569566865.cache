Previously invented relay coding strategies have not been designed to achieve this enormous capacity occurring in the low SNR region. In this paper, we propose a simple coding strategy for a relay channel with low SNRs or, equivalently, for a very noisy relay channel. The multiplicative repetition is utilized to design this simple coding strategy. We claim that the proposed strategy is simple since the destination and the relay can decode with almost the same computational complexity by sharing the same structure of decoder. An appropriate static power allocation which yields the maximum throughput close to the optimal one in low SNRs is suggested. Under practical constraints such as equal time-sharing etc., the asymptotic performance of this simple strategy is within 0.5 dB from the achievable rate of relay channel. Furthermore, the performance at short code lengths enjoys a relaying gain by approximately 1.4 dB."},"body":{"text":"A three terminals relay channel [1], which consists of a source (S), a relay (R) and a destination (D), is an elementary component of a cooperative network. By using the decode- and-forward protocol, R is capable to decode the received signal and forward the decoded information to the D. This protocol yields the signiﬁcant increase in the capacity com- paring to that of a direct transmission when the quality of S-R link is good [2]. At the present moment, full-duplex relaying is still impractical since (R) cannot receive and transmit simultaneously with good quality at the same time [3]. We therefore focus our study on the time-division based half- duplex relaying since this system is regarded as more practical. Throughout this paper, we simply refer to this type of system with decode-and-forward protocal as relay channel.\nBy using the information theoretic tool [4], it can be ob- served that the increase in capacity with the cost of employing relay (relaying gain) is very large especially at low to medium signal to noise ratios (SNRs) [5]. The recent progress on the development of relay coding strategies which offer the excellent performance in medium SNRs can be found in [3], [6], [7] while the efﬁcient strategy to capture the relaying gain in low SNRs has not been proposed. We thus focus our attention on designing the coding strategy for low SNRs.\nIn order to function close to the theoretical limit of relay channel, we have to deal with the coding strategy of very large code lengths (10 4 ∼ 10 5 bits). For example, at medium SNRs, the optimized binary low density parity-check (BLDPC) codes\nof length 10 5 bits can perform within 1 ∼ 1.5 dB from the achievable rate of relay channel [3], [6], [7]. Unfortunately, there is a limit on the size of code length in wireless com- munication with delay constraint. The large code lengths lead to the transmission latency and complex decoders which are not preferable in the real world communication. It is thus quite impractical to build such a coded relay system with the current wireless technologies in which short code lengths (10 2 ∼ 10 3 bits) are feasible.\nIn this paper, we focus our attention on nonbinary LDPC (NBLDPC) codes deﬁned over GF(2 8 ) with regular parity- check matrix of column weight 2. This is motivated by the outstanding performance at short code lengths with the simplest form of regular parity-check matrix [8], [9]. The concept of multiplicative repetition is applied for designing the simple relay coding strategy. We demonstrate that the proposed strategy is the promising technique for capturing relaying gain at low SNRs. This is illustrated via the simulation under practical constraints such as equal time-sharing and static power allocation. Based on the simulation results, the proposed technique can be used to enable reliable relay communication in very noisy case (using a bit error rate of 10 −5 as the reliable communication).\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The NBLDPC codes are introduced in Section II. In Section III, the system model for NBLDPC coded half duplex relaying is described. In Section IV, we discuss an appropriate static power allocation and develop a simple NBLDPC coding strategy which appli- cable to very noisy relay channel. In Section V, we present the simulation performance of the proposed relay coding strategy at short to medium code lengths. The conclusions are ﬁnally given in Section VI.\nAn NBLDPC code C over GF(2 m ) is deﬁned by the null- space of a sparse M × N parity-check matrix H = (h ij ) deﬁned over GF(2 m ) [8]\nwhere x = (x 1 , . . . , x N ) is a codeword. The ith parity-check equation for i = 1, . . . , M is written as h i1 x 1 + h i2 x 2 + · · · + h iN x N = 0 where h i1 , . . . , h iN ∈ GF(2 m ) are the entries of ith row of H. The parameter N is the codeword length in symbol. Assuming H is of full rank, the number of information\nsymbols is given by K = N − M. The coding rate R of any NBLDPC code can be computed by R = K/N .\nAn NBLDPC code is called (d v , d c )-regular if the parity- check matrix of the code has constant column weight d v and row weight d c . In this paper, only the (d v = 2, d c )-regular NBLDPC codes deﬁned over GF(2 8 ) are considered, since, for point to point channels, they are empirically known as the best performing codes especially for short code lengths [8], [9]. We can represent the parity-check matrix of an NBLDPC code by a Tanner graph with variable and check nodes [10]. Each variable node and check node represents a coded symbol and a parity-check equation, respectively.\nIn time-division based half-duplex relaying [5], the trans- mission in relay channel takes place over two time slots of normalized duration. In the ﬁrst time slot of duration t, S sends information to R and D. In the second time slot of duration t \u2032 = 1 − t, R and S send information to D. The ﬁrst time slot is referred to as broadcast (BC) mode whereas the second time slot is referred to as multiple-access (MAC) mode. The parameter t is known as the time-sharing factor. Figure 1 illustrates the transmission in the time-division based half- duplex relay system. Parameters h SD , h SR and h RD generally represent the channel effects.\nAssuming that the relay channel is governed by channel code of rate R with the information of length k bits (the overall code length is thus n = k/R bits). By using decode- and-forward protocol, the transmission relay system can be described as follows. In BC mode, S ﬁrstly encodes the k information bits with a code of length tn and of rate R S,BC = k tn . The tn coded bits are transmitted to both R and D. At the end of BC mode, R decodes its received signals and the estimation obtained from decoder will be further used in MAC mode. Meanwhile, D just stores the received signals. In MAC mode, R transmits another set of t \u2032 n = n −tn bits to D by using the estimation decoded in BC mode. At the same time, S also simultaneously sends t \u2032 n bits to D. Finally, D can decode the received information transmitted in BC mode at lower code rate R = R D,MAC = k tn+t \u2032 n = k n since it receives the additional information transmitted in the MAC mode.\nSince, in this paper, the binary modulation is assumed and the relay system is coded by NBLDPC codes, we thus describe how to transmit the NBLDPC coded symbols x v by using the binary modulation scheme for v = 1, . . . , N . We can represent each coded symbol x v ∈ GF(2 m ) by using the binary sequences of length m bits. For each m, we ﬁx a Galois ﬁeld GF(2 m ) with a primitive element α and its primitive polynomial π. Once a primitive element α of GF(2 m ) is ﬁxed, each symbol is given by an m-bit representation [11, p. 110]. At the vth output of NBLDPC encoder, each coded symbol x v ∈ GF(2 m ) is mapped to the binary sequence of m bits (x v,1 , x v,2 , . . . , x v,m ) ∈ GF(2) m according to the primitive polynomial as described above. The obtained binary sequence (x v,1 , x v,2 , . . . , x v,m ) ∈ GF(2) m is then mapped to m modulated signals through the mapper for the binary transmission.\nFollowing [12], an equivalent physical model of the half- duplex relay system shown in Fig. 1 is illustrated in Fig. 2. In this model, R is placed on the direct line between S and D. The distance between S and D is normalized to 1 while the distance between S and R is denoted by d for d < 1.\nFor ith transmission (consisting of two time slots), let s (i) S,BC be the modulated binary signals transmitted from S in BC mode, let s (i) S,MAC be the modulated binary signals transmitted from S in MAC mode and let s (i) R,MAC be the modulated binary signals transmitted from R in MAC mode. In the similar way, y (i) D,BC , y (i) D,MAC and y (i) R,BC are deﬁned as the received signals at given positions and modes. From the notations above, the received signals at R and D in BC mode can be written as [3]\nwhere n (i) D,BC , n (i) R,MAC and n (i) D,MAC are AWGN with zero mean and unit variance. In this paper, we consider only the large scale path loss. Under this circumstance, |h SD | 2 = 1, |h SR | 2 =\nand |h RD | 2 = 1 (1 −d) α where α is the path loss exponent. For a fair comparison with direct transmission (the communication that consists of S and D), the transmitted powers of S and R must satisfy an average global power constraint given as [3]\nwhere P S,BC is the average transmitted power of S in BC mode, P S,MAC and P R,MAC are the average transmitted powers\nof S and R in MAC mode respectively. P is the total transmis- sion power of the relay system. The relationship between the total transmission power and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the relay system is deﬁned as follows [3].\nwhere R is the coding rate for the relay channel and E b /N 0 is the the energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio.\nIn order to obtain the optimal achievable rate for time- division half-duplex relay channel with decode-and-forward protocol, a joint optimization is needed over the correlation in MAC mode, time-sharing factor and power allocation (see e.g. [3] for a complete detail of computing an achievable rate).\nIt is worth noting that maintaining the reliable commu- nication in low SNRs (or equivalently very noisy channel) is to deal with low rate channel code. In this section, we ﬁrst describe the multiplicative repetition which exactly is the method to construct high performance low rate NBLDPC codes. After that, the proposed coding strategy and static power allocation for very noisy relay channel are presented.\nRecently, Kasai et al. proposed an efﬁcient method called multiplicative repetition to construct low-rate NBLDPC codes [13]. Over point to point channels, the multiplicatively re- peated NBLDPC codes constructed by this method outperform the previously found low-rate codes. By using the NBLDPC code of rate R 1 , we can easily construct code NBLDPC codes of lower rate R < R 1 as described as follows.\nLet C 1 denote an NBLDPC code of length N and coding rate R 1 . Since code C 1 is used to construct another code, we refer to C 1 as a mother code. A low-rate code C 2 of length 2N and coding rate R 2 = 1 2 R 1 can be constructed as follows. We select N coefﬁcients r N +1 , . . . , r 2N randomly from GF(2 m ) \\ {0}. Note that we deﬁne r v = 1 ∈ GF(2 m ) for v = 1, . . . , N for simplicity of notation. We then multiplicatively repeat the coded symbols from C 1 with the coefﬁcients to obtain the lower-rate code C 2 as follows.\nC 2 = {(x 1 , . . . , x 2N ) ∈ GF(2 m ) 2N | x N +v = r N +v x v , for v = 1, . . . , N , (x 1 , . . . , x N ) ∈ C 1 }.\nIn this way, we can construct a (2N, K) code from an (N, K) code.\nThe codes C 3 , . . . , C T of lower coding rates can also be constructed from code C 1 through the multiplicative repeti- tion process. We refer a parameter T as repetition param- eter. For T ≥ 3, in a recursive fashion, N coefﬁcients r (T −1)N+1 , . . . , r T N are chosen randomly from GF(2 m ) \\{0}. The code C T of rate R T = 1 T R 1 can also be constructed as follows.\nx (T −1)N+v = r (T −1)N+v x v , for v = 1, . . . , N, (x 1 , . . . , x (T −1)N ) ∈ C T −1 }.\nB. Power Allocation for Low SNRs and Good Suboptimal Parameters\nChakrabarti et al. investigated the sensitivity of achievable rate of half duplex relay channel [5]. This work clearly shows that the suboptimal parameters which are equal time-sharing (t =1/2) and completely correlated source in MAC mode incur the marginal loss marginal in achievable rate. It is known that the static power allocation, equal time-sharing, and completely correlated source in MAC mode are quite attractive from the practical point of view because the design of relay protocol, scheduling, and synchronization can be simpliﬁed. Thus, the remaining is to ﬁnd the static power allocation (power allocation is static for all points of operating SNRs) that yields a good achievable rate.\nWe suggest that an appropriate static power allocation for low SNRs can be computed by averaging the optimal power allocation in the region of interest. This can be done as follows : Let g = {g 1 , . . . , g b } be the set of discrete values of SNR. The set of optimal power allocation at S in BC mode which corresponds to g is denoted by P ∗ S,BC = {P ∗ S,BC (g 1 ), . . . , P ∗ S,BC (g b ) }. The sets P ∗ S,MAC and P ∗ R,MAC\nare deﬁned in the same way. The fractions of power at each mode and terminal calculating from the set of optimal power allocation are as follows\ng i . Consequently, the static power allocation based on the concept of averaging can be expressed as\nVarious achievable rates R obtained from the different set of parameters are displayed in Fig. 3. The direct capacity is also plotted to illustrate the relaying gain. An optimal achievable rate (unconstrained input, i.e., Gaussian input) is the leftmost curve. As we expected from the conclusions given in [5], an achievable rate from optimal power allocation, t = 1/2, and r = 1 is very close to the optimal rate at low SNRs (or equivalently R < 0.4). By using the averaging concept, suggested above, to ﬁnd the static power allocation, κ S,BC = 0.6456, κ S,MAC = 0.0634, and κ R,MAC = 0.2910 are\nobtained when g = {-16 dB, -15 dB, . . . , -8 dB} is chosen. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that this static power allocation together with t = 1/2 and r = 1 can bring the achievable rate very close to the optimal one. Note that the chosen g is the set of SNR points in low SNR region, For BPSK input, this suggested static power allocation offers the relaying gain in low rates by more than 3 dB. We also show that the equal power allocation with t = 1/2 and r = 1 is not attractive\n(though it is simple) since it suffers from the rate loss more than 2 dB (comparing to optimal rate).\nIn this subsection, we develop a simple low rate coding strategy for equal time-sharing constraint. The proposed low rate relay coding strategy can be described as follows.\n1) Encoding in BC mode: By using a multiplicatively repeated NBLDPC code of rate R S,BC = K T N with T ≥ 1, S encodes K information symbols into a codeword x = (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x T N ) ∈ GF(2 m ) T N . This codeword x ∈ C T is mapped to a binary sequence of length tn = mT N bits. Then the BPSK modulated signals of the binary sequence are sent to R and D. S also stores the codeword x for using in MAC mode. Note that the mother code is (N, K) NBLPDC code and the associated Tanner graph has N variable nodes.\n2) Decoding in BC mode: R decodes its received signals by using the BP algorithm [14]. This is analogous to the decoding of multiplicative repeated NBLDPC codes with repetition parameter T (see section III of [13] for decoding algorithm). After BP decoding, R produces an estimated codeword ˆ x R ∈ GF(2 m ) T N . The decoding is accomplished on the Tanner graph of mother code with N variable nodes. Meanwhile, D only stores its received signals for the future decoding at the end of MAC mode.\n3) Encoding in MAC mode: By using x = (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x T N ) ∈ C T stored in BC mode, S ﬁrst generate (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x 2T N ) ∈ C 2T by using the multiplicative repetition. S then sends only T N multiplicative symbols x S = (x T N +1 , x N +2 , . . . , x 2T N ) to D. Therefore, the amount of information sent by S is t \u2032 n = mT N bits.\nIn the same way, as S produces x S from x, R produces x R ∈ GF(2 m ) T N from ˆ x R ∈ GF(2 m ) T N obtained from decoding process in BC mode and sends this to D. By doing this, the amount of information generating in this mode is equal to the information sent in BC mode. This corresponds to the equal\ntime sharing constraint since tn = t \u2032 n. We note that S and R will send the same coded symbols in this mode if R, in BC mode, did successfully decode the codeword, i.e., ˆ x R = x. This means the additional parity symbols sent from S and R in this mode are fully correlated.\n4) Decoding in MAC mode: At this step, D has two received signals which are y (1) D,BC , . . . , y (mN ) D,BC corresponding to codes C 1 , . . . , C T and y (mN +1) D,MAC , . . . , y (mT N ) D,MAC corresponding to codes C T +1 , . . . , C 2T . The overall 2T N coded symbols or equiva- lently 2mT N coded bits are now stored at D. The overall code rate of the relay channel is thus R = K 2T N . After combining the received signals from two modes, we note that the decoding process can be done over the Tanner graph of mother code with N variable nodes even we have 2T N received information symbols. This is analogous to the decoding of multiplicative repeated NBLDPC codes with repetition parameter 2T [13]. Finally, D produces an estimated codeword ˆ x D ∈ GF(2 m ) N as an output.\nWe claim that the proposed coding strategy is very simple since the Tanner graphs of decoders at both R and D are the same, i.e., the Tanner graph of mother code. The difference of decoding at R and D is only the initialization. Thus, the computational complexity of the decoders are almost the same even the code rate at D is lower than that of R.\nIn this section, we examine the decoding performance of the proposed coding strategy. For all results, the regular (d v = 2, d c ) NBLDPC codes deﬁned over GF(2 8 ) are employed. The FFT-based BP algorithm [14] with the maximum iteration ℓ max = 100 is used for decoding. The BPSK modulation is used for all the links in the relay channel. We set the attenuation exponent to α = 2 and the S-R distance is d = 0.5. The concept of ﬁnding the static power allocation presented in the previous section is used for all results.\nWe ﬁrst assess the proposed coding strategy by using the Monte Carlo density evolution [15, pp.22-23]. The Monte Carlo density evolution is a tool for calculating the minimum SNR of which NBLDPC codes can reliably decode the noisy received signal by assuming very large code length and cycle free Tanner graph. This minimum SNR is often known as the decoding threshold. The Monte Carlo density evolution for direct transmission is extended to calculate the decoding threshold of the proposed NBLDPC relay coding strategy and the decoding thresholds are reported in Table 1. It is obviously seen that the proposed coding strategy can asymptotically perform within 0.5 dB from the achievable rate.\nAfter looking at the performance in the limit of large code length, the performance at ﬁnite code lengths is presented. The performance of the proposed coding strategy at low SNRs is shown in Fig. 4. The mother code is regular (2, 3) NBLDPC codes of rate R S,BC = 1/3. The proposed coding strategy with R = 1/6 and R = 1/12 is constructed from repetition parameter T = 1 and T = 2 respectively. At BER of 10 −5 , it can be seen that the proposed coding strategy of information lengths k = 576 bits (code length n = k/R) performs within\n2.3 dB from the achievable rate. The relaying gain, as deﬁned in introduction, of about 1.4 dB can also be realized by this short information length. Moreover, it is obviously seen that the FER performance is very good without employing high rate algebraic channel code as an outer code.\nAlthough the transmission model in MAC mode described in (4) is widely used but the signals from S and R must be coherently combined. This may cause a high complexity of the receiver. This problem can be easily alleviated by keeping S silent in MAC mode. In this circumstance, D receives the additional information of length t \u2032 n only from R. Under the same constraints, it is seen from Fig. 4 that the proposed coding strategy with R = 1/6 and silent S in MAC mode is away from its original performance by about 0.5 dB. We note that the static power allocation for S in BC mode and R in MAC mode is also based on the averaging concept presented in the previous subsection. This proves that the method to ﬁnd the static power allocation for low SNRs which is suggested in this paper is very useful.\nIn this paper, the simple NBLDPC coding strategy for very noisy relay channel is presented. We have demonstrated that this NBLDPC coding strategy is very promising to capture the\nrelaying gain in very noisy relay channel under very practical constraints. The advantages of the proposed strategy can be listed as follows: 1) The waterfall performance within 2.3 dB from the achievable rate can be obtained by using the moderate length NBLDPC codes. 2) We do not need the code optimization process. We just employ the (2, d c )-regular NBLDPC deﬁned over GF(2 8 ) as the channel code. 3) The FER performances obtained from the (2, d c )-regular NBLDPC codes are excellent. 4) The relay and the destination can decode with almost the same computational complexity since both the relay and the destination use the same Tanner graph for decoding. 5) The encoding processes for both the source and the relay in MAC mode are very simple since we employ the multiplicative repetition which requires only (T − 1)N multiplications over GF(2 m ).\nThis work is ﬁnancially supported by the Telecommunica- tions Research Industrial and Development Institute (TRIDI), with National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), Grant No.PHD/009/2552."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"E.
