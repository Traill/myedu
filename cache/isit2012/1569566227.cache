As pointed out in [1], however, most studies on random access systems are built upon simplistic physical layer models such as the collision channel which is too pessimistic and assumes that if more than one nodes transmit simultaneously, none of them are successful [2]\u2013[4]. The multipacket reception (MPR) model allows successful reception of simultaneously transmitted packets [5]\u2013[7]. How- ever, the use of channel state information (CSI) is ignored as the channels are modeled with constant success probabilities over time.\nExploiting CSI for increasing the network capacity has been thoroughly investigated for point-to-point links at the physical layer (see [8] and references therein). The gain from utilizing the CSI information is due to the multiuser diversity that needs precise CSI feedback to the centralized controller. This is a very strong and rather unrealistic requirement. In [9] and [10], it was shown that a variant of the ALOHA protocol in the way that the nodes adapt their transmissions based on the local CSI, called channel-aware random access (CARA), can signiﬁcantly improve the sum throughput even without the centralized controller. However, these results were derived under the simplifying assumption that the users are always backlogged and experience identically distributed channel con- ditions. Subsequently, the authors in [11] and [12] extended the results to the case of bursty sources and derived the stability\nregion 1 of CARA for the non-identical two-node case. Note that even for the original ALOHA with static channels, an exact stability analysis is available only for the two-node case and only bounds are known for the cases with arbitrary number of nodes [2]\u2013[7]. This is due to the complicated interaction between queues, i.e., the service process of a queue depends on the status of the other queues.\nOn the other hand, all the above-mentioned results on CARA assumed the availability of perfect CSI at each node. In practice, however, the channel states may not be directly observable but rather needs to be estimated. Subsequently, errors in estimation will result in the performance degradation, which is what we focus on in this paper. In [13], the stability region of CARA with imperfect CSI was obtained for the two- node case but under the simplistic collision channel model. It also did not obtain the closure of the stability region which is a common criterion for comparison between different systems.\nIn this work, an exact characterization of the stability region of CARA with arbitrary error rates is obtained for the two- node case with a receiver having MPR capability. The obtained results, therefore, generalize the cases of having perfect CSI with either the collision channel or the channel with MPR capability. Unlike the constant MPR model considered in [5]\u2013 [7], the MPR probabilities in our model depend not only on the set of transmitters but also on their instantaneous channel conditions. The effect of channel uncertainty on the stability of CARA is identiﬁed by comparing with the cases of having perfect CSI and no CSI. Finally, we make a comparison with the class of stationary scheduling policies which requires channel state feedback to a centralized controller.\nWe consider a time-slotted system consisting of N nodes transmitting to a common receiver having MPR capability [5]\u2013[7]. The formulation is for arbitrary N but most of the results are for N = 2. Each node i has an inﬁnite size buffer for storing the arriving packets. The packet arrivals at each queue i are modeled as a Bernoulli process 2 of rate\nλ i per slot and the slot duration is equal to the transmission time of a single packet. The channel state between node i and the receiver at time slot t is denoted by C i (t) which is randomly time-varying between \u2018Good\u2019 and \u2018Bad\u2019 states, i.e., C i (t) ∈ {G, B}. Let C(t) denote the channel state vector of the transmitting nodes among {1, . . . , N}. Channels hold their states for the duration of a slot, and potentially change on slot boundaries. The channel states at different nodes are assumed to be independent, but the realizations of a channel at different times are not necessarily independent of each other. The channels are stationary and the steady-state probabilities that channel i is in \u2018Good\u2019 and \u2018Bad\u2019 states are denoted by π G i and π B i , respectively.\nDenote with q i |C(t) the success probability of node i for a given channel state vector C (t). Since we are considering the scenario with a common receiver, if one node\u2019s channel is in \u2018Good\u2019 state, then it is likely to interfere with the other nodes at a higher level. Consequently, for the two-node case, the MPR probabilities satisfy q 1|{G,G} ≤ q 1|{G,B} and q 2|{G,G} ≤ q 2|{B,G} . We assume throughout the paper that the success probability when a node\u2019s own channel state is \u2018Bad\u2019 is zero regardless of the level of interference. This describes the situation where its channel is in deep fading and, thus, the signal-to-noise ratio itself is below a certain threshold for successful decoding of the transmitted packets.\nDenote by ˜ C i (t) the estimated channel state that may not coincide with the actual state C i (t). Let us deﬁne the following probabilities of channel estimation errors: ǫ G i = Pr[ ˜ C i (t) = B |C i (t) = G] and ǫ B i = Pr[ ˜ C i (t) = G |C i (t) = B], and let ¯ ǫ G i = 1 − ǫ G i and ¯ ǫ B i = 1 − ǫ B i . Denote by ǫ i the vector of channel estimation error probabilities of node i, i.e., ǫ i = (ǫ G i , ǫ B i ), and let ǫ denote the vector of ǫ i for i = 1, . . . , N . In each time slot, each node adapts its transmission based on the estimated channel state in the sense that it attempts to transmit with probability p i if ˜ C i (t) = G and its queue, whose length is denoted by Q i (t), is non-empty. Otherwise, it remains silent. The performance of this adaptation, which was previously considered in [11]\u2013[13] with perfect CSI, would highly depend on the accuracy of the channel estimation.\nThe stability region of a system is deﬁned as the set of arrival rates λ for which the queues in the system are stable. Queue i is said to be stable if lim t →∞ Pr[Q i (t) < x] = F (x) and lim x →∞ F (x) = 1 [3]. Loynes\u2019 theorem as it relates to stability plays a central role throughout this paper [14]. It states that if the arrival and service processes of a queue are strictly jointly stationary and the average arrival rate is less than the average service rate, the queue is stable.\nIn this section, we present the stability region of CARA in the presence of channel estimation errors for the two-node case and compare it to the cases of having perfect CSI and no CSI. To bypass the coupling among the queues, we use the stochastic dominance technique [2]. Denote by S (p) the stability region of CARA for a given transmission probability\nwhich are functions of channel statistics and transmission success probabilities.\nLemma 3.1: The stability region S (p) of CARA in the presence of channel estimation errors is given by the union of subregions described by\nThe closure of the stability region S is obtained by taking the union of S (p) over all feasible transmission probability vectors p ∈ [0, 1] 2 , i.e.,\nLet us deﬁne the following points in the two-dimensional Euclidean space through their coordinates:\nwhich are all in the ﬁrst quadrant. Theorem 3.1: If Ψ ǫ 1 q\n≥ 1, the boundary of the stability region S of CARA in the presence of channel estimation errors is described by (i) the line connecting P Y = (0, π G 2 ¯ ǫ G 2 q 2|{G} ) and P 1 , (ii) the curve\n< 1, it is described by (i) the line connecting P Y and P 3 and (ii) the line connecting P 3 and P X .\nProof: The proof can be done similarly to that of Theorem 3.1 in [7] and is omitted due to space limitation.\nNote that for any arrival rate vector inside the stability region, there exists a transmission probability vector which stabilizes the system.\n≤ 1, then S is convex polygon. Speciﬁcally, if Ψ ǫ 1 q\n= 1, it becomes a right triangle. Otherwise, the region is non-convex.\nThis corollary can be easily veriﬁed by comparing the slopes of the lines from P Y to P 1 and from P 2 to P X and those from P Y to P 3 and from P 3 to P X . Speciﬁcally, if Ψ ǫ 1 q\n= 1, the curve (2) shrinks to a point whose coordinate is identically described by both P 1 and P 2 and the slopes of the lines from P Y to P 1 and from P 2 to P X become identical.\nRemark 3.1: Consider the case of having perfect CSI, i.e., the estimated channel states are always identical to the actual states. This can be viewed as a special case of our model with ǫ = 0. By substituting ǫ = 0 into Theorem 3.1, we can obtain the description for the case of having perfect CSI.\nWe next consider the case where CSI is not available and hence a decision on transmission has to be made independently of the underlying channel state. This corresponds to the original ALOHA in which each node attempts to transmit with probability p i regardless of the channel state. Since the stable throughput and its multi-dimensional stability region is a steady-state measure of the network performance, it depends only on the stationary behavior of the system 3 . Consider a system with constant success probabilities that are equal to the average probabilities experienced in the time-varying system. Then, the stability regions of the two systems must be identical, if started from the same initial conditions. Denote with q s i and q m i respectively the constant success probabilities seen by node i when it transmits alone or along with the other node j ( = i) for the two-node case and deﬁne ∆ i = q s i − q m i\nwhich is assumed to be strictly positive. The following theorem appears in [7], but is repeated here to keep our treatment self- contained.\n≥ 1, the boundary of the stability region S of ALOHA over static MPR channels is described by (i) the line connecting P Y = (0, q s 2 ) and P 1 =\n), (ii) the curve √ ∆ 2 λ 1 + √ ∆ 1 λ 2 = q s 1 q s 2 from P 1 to P 2 = ( ∆ 2 q s 1 q s\n), and (iii) the line con- necting P 2 and P X = (q s 1 , 0). If ∆ 1 q s\n< 1, it is described by (i) the line connecting P Y and P 3 = (q s 1 − ∆ 1 , q s 2 − ∆ 2 ) and (ii) the line connecting P 3 and P X .\nRemark 3.2: Denote with ¯ q s i and ¯ q m i respectively the av- erage success probability seen by node i in the considered time-varying system when it transmits alone or along with the other node j (= i). It can be shown that ¯ q s 1 = π G 1 q 1|{G} and\n¯ q m 2 = π G 2 (π 1,G q 2|{G,G} + π B 1 q 2|{B,G} ). Then, by substituting ¯ q s i and ¯ q m i into q s i and q m i in the above theorem, we can obtain the stability region of ALOHA when the channels may be time-varying but the transmission policy ignores the time- variation.\nBy comparing with the case of having perfect CSI, Fig. 1 shows how the stability region of CARA is affected by the channel estimation errors. It is obvious that the stability region of the original ALOHA is always a proper subset of that of CARA when perfect CSI is available. This complies with the results obtained in [11]. In the presence of channel estimation errors, however, this may not be true as shown in the ﬁgure. This is because the CARA does not allow nodes to transmit when the observed channel state is bad.\nIn this section, we compare the stability region of CARA to that achieved by considering all the stationary scheduling policies which require CSI feedback to the centralized con- troller. Note that a scheduler allocates each time slot to one of the nodes such that the scheduled node can transmit in an interference-free environment during its allocated time slots. In [15], it was shown that the queue length information can be further utilized to improve the scheduling performance. Speciﬁcally, the discovered policy that serves the longest connected queue (LCQ) among those in \u2018Good\u2019 channel state stabilizes the system whenever the input rate vector is inside the stability region that is obtained by considering all the stationary scheduling policies. This is why the LCQ policy is called throughput-optimal. The following theorem is derived again for the case with channel estimation errors, which was originally derived in [15] with perfect CSI.\nTheorem 4.1: The necessary and sufﬁcient condition for stability under all the stationary scheduling policies in the presence of channel estimation errors is\nFurthermore, the LCQ policy stabilizes the system as long as it is stabilizable.\nFor the two-node case, the stability condition (3) is equiv- alent to\nwith λ i < π G i ¯ ǫ G i q i |{G} for i ∈ {1, 2}. In Fig. 2, we compare the stability region of CARA to that achieved by centralized schedulers, and it can be observed that the former is not necessarily a subset of the latter. Indeed, the relationship between them depends on parameters such as the channel estimation error probabilities and the MPR probabilities. Note that when the stability region of CARA is non-convex, or convex but with the vertex P 3 given in (1) strictly contained in the stability region achieved by centralized schedulers, then the region becomes a subset of that achieved by the schedulers. The condition for P 3 to be inside the stability region achieved by centralized schedulers is given by\nOtherwise, if the stability region of CARA is convex but condition (4) does not hold, the stability region of CARA is not a proper subset of that achieved by centralized schedulers, i.e., there exists a rate region that can be achieved only by CARA.\nWe showed that the stability region of the original ALOHA is not a proper subset of that of CARA in the presence of channel estimation errors. To guarantee the superiority of\nCARA even with channel estimation errors, we may need to modify CARA itself which was not considered here. We also compared the stability region of CARA to that achieved by centralized schedulers and observed that CARA may outperform the centralized schedulers as the MPR capability improves. The stability analysis of CARA had to resolve the interaction between nodes. Consequently, extending the results to the general case with an arbitrary number of nodes, i.e., N > 2, although highly desirable, presents serious difﬁculties and was not considered here.\nConstruct a hypothetical system S 1 which is identical to the original system except that node 1 transmits dummy packets when its packet queue is empty. Sending dummy packets is only aimed to cause constant interference to the other node and not counted as actual packet transmissions. Deﬁne I i (t) to be an indicator function for the event that the transmission by node i is successful. Then, by conditioning on the underlying channel states, the average service rate of queue 2 can be expressed as\n(5) where the time index t is suppressed in the steady-state. By further conditioning on the estimated channel states, we obtain\n+ q 2|{G} p 2 (1 − p 1 ) + q 2|{G,G} p 1 p 2 ¯ ǫ G 1 ¯ ǫ G 2 (6) Pr[I 2 |C = {B, G}] = q 2|{G} p 2 ¯ ǫ B 1 ¯ ǫ G 2\nSubstituting (6) and (7) into (5) yields the stability condition for queue 2 as\nIf λ 2 satisﬁes (8), i.e., if queue 2 in this dominant system is stable, let us compute the average service rate of queue 1. Since queue 2 is stable, it empties out with non-zero probability that is given by\nNote that the success probability of queue 1 depends whether queue 2 is empty or not. Therefore, by conditioning on Q 2 , we express the service rate of queue 1 as\n(9) Using similar arguments used to obtain the service rate of µ 2 in (8), it is given as\nUsing the fact that node 2 does not transmit when its queue is empty, we have\nSubstituting into (9) yields the stability condition for queue 1 as\n(10) The stability condition for queue 1 given above is not only sufﬁcient but also necessary in the original system. This can be proved using the so-called indistinguishability argument [2]. The sufﬁcient part is trivial which follows from the construction of the dominant system whose queue sizes, at all times, at least as large as those in the original system. The necessary part is argued as follows. If for some λ 1 , queue 1 saturates, then always a real packet will be chosen for a transmission, i.e., the dominant system and the original systems are indistinguishable. Since this statement holds as long as the input rate vector is strictly outside the stability region, the boundaries of the two systems must be identical.\nThe pair of inequalities (8) and (10) describes the ﬁrst subregion in the lemma. By reversing the roles of the two nodes in system S 1 , we can obtain the other pair of inequalities which describes the second subregion.\nAssume that the system is operating under some stationary policy and is stable. Denote by A i (t), M i (t), and Y i (t) the number of packets arriving at node i, the indicator function on the success of the transmission when node i is scheduled, and the indicator function that is equal to 1 if the actual channel state of node i is \u2018Good\u2019 and estimated correctly. The expecta- tions are given by E [A i (t)] = λ i , E [M i (t)] = q i |{C i (t)} , and E [Y i (t)] = π G i ¯ ǫ G i . The number of packets at queue i evolves in time according to\nwhere h i (t) = 1 if Y i (t) = 1 and node i is scheduled. The departure rate from queue i is\nand since we are considering a stable system, the departure rate should be equal to the arrival rate λ i . Consequently, for any set of queues N \u2032 , we have\nConsider the partition of the probability space into Ω 1 = { Y i (t) = 0, i ∈ N \u2032 }\nwhere Ω c is the complement of set Ω. Notice that E i ∈N \u2032 h i (t) |Ω l = 0 for l = 1, 2 and, therefore, we have\nBecause of the independence of the channel processes between different nodes, we have\nand Pr[Ω 2 ] > 0 due to the stationarity of the system. Therefore, we have\nEquations (11) and (12) imply (3). This completes the neces- sity part of the proof. For the sufﬁciency, we use the Lyapunov drift argument similar to that used in [15] and the Lyapunov function L (Q) = N i =1 q −1 i |{G} Q 2 i .
