Here, ϕ is a given R d -valued Z-measurable moment mapping .\nIn (1), β is any mapping Z×R → (−∞,+∞] such that β(·, t) is Z-measurable for t ∈ R, and β(z, ·), z ∈ Z, is in the class Γ of functions γ on R that are ﬁnite and strictly convex for t > 0, equal to +∞ for t < 0, and satisfy γ(0) = lim t↓0 γ(t). In particular, β is a normal integrand whence z → β(z, g(z)) is Z-measurable if g is [18, Chapter 14]. If neither the positive nor the negative part of β(z, g(z)) is µ-integrable, the integral in (1) is +∞ by convention. The integrand is autonomous if β(z, ·) = γ, z ∈ Z, for some γ ∈ Γ .\nGiven a ∈ R d , let G a denote the class of those nonnegative Z-measurable functions g whose moment vector exists and equals a. By the assumptions on β, the minimization of H β restricts to G a . Following the key papers [3], [4], convex duality has become a standard tool in the mathematically oriented literature on the subject. The value function\nHere, ·, · denotes the scalar product on R d and β ∗ (z, r) is equal to sup t∈R [tr−β(z, t)] for r ∈ R. In (2)/(3), the minimization/maximization is called primal/dual problem, the inﬁmum/supremum primal/dual value, and a minimizer/ma- ximizer, if exists, is a primal/dual solution. Since β is strictly convex, the primal solution, denoted by g a , is unique in the sense that any two minimizers are equal µ-a.e.\nMinimization problems as in (2) emerge across various scientiﬁc disciplines, notably in inference. When g is an unknown probability density, or any nonnegative function, whose moment vector is determined by measurements and a speciﬁc choice of β is justiﬁed, often the primal solution as above is adopted as the \u2018best guess\u2019 of g. Among au- tonomous integrands, typical choices of β are t ln t or − ln t or t 2 giving H β (g) equal to the negative Shannon or Burg entropy or the squared L 2 -norm of g 0. Note also that the maximum likelihood estimation in exponential families is a special case of the dual problem (3), with β equal to t ln t. When a \u2018prior guess\u2019 h for g is available, that would be adopted before the measurement, it is common to use a non- autonomous integrand β depending on h for which H β (g) represents a non-metric distance of g from h. Two cases are prominent: γ-divergence Z h γ(g/h)dµ with γ ∈ Γ [6], [1], [20] and Bregman distance [5], [13], [16], see (6). Then the corresponding primal solution is often referred to as a projection of h to G a . In particular, the most familiar I-projections correspond to the information (I-) divergence that belongs to both families of distances. Note that while the minimization of a γ-divergence can be reduced to that of an integral functional with autonomous integrand, this is in general not possible for Bregman distances whence the nonautonomous integrands become unavoidable.\nThe primal problem is well understood when the following primal constraint qualiﬁcation (PCQ) holds\nHere, ri stands for the relative interior and dom for the ef- fective domain. Theorem 1 below implies by standard convex duality results [17] that under the PCQ the primal and dual values coincide, a dual solution exists and explicitly speciﬁes the primal solution when the latter exists. This covers for example the classical maximization of Shannon differential entropy over probability densities on R with given mean and variance. Even under the PCQ the primal solution need not\nexist, as in Example 1. Note that while the PCQ often holds for each a ∈ dom(J β ), perhaps with exception of the origin, in many inference problems of practical interest this is not the case. Hence, dispensing with the PCQ is desirable.\nThis work is a follow-up of the authors\u2019 contribution [11] at ISIT\u201908 motivated by their previous work [9] about I- projections. As there, the PCQ is dispensed with, and in the case when no primal/dual solutions exist, generalized solutions in the sense of [19], [7] are studied. In [11], as in most of the previous literature, it is assumed that the integrand is autonomous, differentiable, and that the moment mapping has one coordinate function identically equal to 1. In this contribution, these assumptions are avoided, saving as many conclusions as possible. For previous works not making these assumptions see [14], [15], using advanced tools of functional analysis. No such tools are used here, and neither is differential geometry, see [2], which is powerful but requires strong regularity assumptions.\nNon-autonomous integrands do not entail conceptual difﬁ- culties since problems with measurability can be handled via the machinery of normal integrands [18]. Non-differentiability of β causes few results to fail. Absence of the special coordi- nate of ϕ is cured by adopting a dual constraint qualiﬁcation. Some results here are new even in the framework of [11].\nSpace limitations do not admit a detailed presentation of results, let alone their proofs. For these, and more references, see the full paper [12] available on arXiv.\nThe key for the close relationship of the primal and dual problems is the following fact which, in this generality, does not seem to directly follow from known results. It can be proved via modiﬁcations of arguments in [18].\nThe hypothesis holds if K β is ﬁnite on an open set. The weaker assumption that K β is proper (not identically +∞ and not attaining −∞) is not sufﬁcient for J β ≡ +∞, see [12].\nTheorem 2. If K β is ﬁnite in a neighborhood of ϑ ∈ R d then it is differentiable there, and J β ( K β (ϑ)) is ﬁnite.\nA special role is played by the set Θ β of those ϑ ∈ dom(K β ) for which the function r → β ∗ (z, r) is ﬁnite in a neighborhood of r = ϑ, ϕ(z) for µ-a.a. z ∈ Z. Equivalently,\nwhere β (z, +∞) denotes the limit of right derivatives β + (z, t) when t ↑ +∞. Since β(z, ·) ∈ Γ implies that β ∗ (z, ·) is differentiable on (−∞, β (z, +∞)), if ϑ ∈ Θ β then\ndeﬁnes a function f ϑ on Z, up to a µ-negligible set. Similarly to [11], the family F β \t {f ϑ : ϑ ∈ Θ β } plays the role of generalized exponential families, provided that the following dual constraint qualiﬁcation (DCQ) holds\nThe DCQ follows from dom(K β ) = ∅ when one component of ϕ is 1. When K β is ﬁnite on an open set, the DCQ holds if and only if\nIf the DCQ holds then the maximization in the dual problem can be restricted to Θ β without changing the dual value and loosing a dual solution. Under the DCQ , if dual solutions ϑ exist then each one induces the same function f ϑ , called here the effective dual solution g ∗ a .\nProposition 1. For any a ∈ R d , if f ϑ ∈ G a for some ϑ ∈ Θ β with K β (ϑ) ﬁnite then f ϑ equals the effective dual solution g ∗ a , as well as the primal solution g a . Under the PCQ , the primal solution g a exists if and only if G a ∩ F β = ∅.\nAs a consequence, if K β is essentially smooth and (5) holds then the primal solution g a exists for each a ∈ ri (dom(J β )).\nwhere g, h are nonnegative Z-measurable functions and ∆ β is a nonnegative integrand such that ∆ β (z, s, t) for z ∈ Z and s, t 0 is equal to\nand s · (+∞) otherwise. Here, γ ∈ Γ abbreviates β(z, ·) and sgn(r) denotes + if r 0 and − if r < 0.\nBregman distances enter into the primal problem via the following identity.\nIn (7), C β is a sophisticated nonnegative correction functional deﬁned explicitly in [12].\nThese results have been known in special settings with β autonomous and (7) in a weaker form as the inequality ob- tained by neglecting the correction. If β is essentially smooth then the correction vanishes anyhow and (7) is known as a Pythagorean identity . For autonomous β that is differentiable but not essentially smooth, the correction is determined in [11].\nIf the primal value J β (a) is ﬁnite and all sequences g n in G a with H β (g n ) → J β (a) converge to a common limit function ˆ g a then ˆ g a is called the generalized primal solution. Here, the convergence is locally in measure, thus in measure on each set A ∈ Z of ﬁnite µ-measure. Proposition 2 implies that, subject to the PCQ and DCQ , the generalized primal solution ˆ g a exists and equals the effective dual solution g ∗ a . Under the PCQ , the generalized primal solution exists if and only if the DCQ holds. This is a new result here, included in Theorem 6(iii).\nThe following example shows that the generalized primal solution ˆ g a may be independent of a, and its moment vector need not exist. For other examples illustrating possible irreg- ularities see [12].\nExample 1. Let µ be the Cauchy distribution on Z = R with dµ = [π(1 + z 2 )] −1 dz, let β be the autonomous integrand given by β(z, t) = t ln t, t > 0, and ϕ(z) = (1, z), z ∈ Z. For a = (a 1 , a 2 ) with a 1 0 and g ∈ G a , if ν denotes the measure with dν = g dµ then H β (g) equals the I-divergence D(ν||µ). In the particular case a 1 = 1, the primal problem is equivalent to minimization of I-divergence from µ over the probability measures ν with mean a 2 . In dual problems, β ∗ (z, r) = e r−1 , ϑ = (ϑ 1 , ϑ 2 ) and K β (ϑ 1 , ϑ 2 ) =\ne ϑ 1 +ϑ 2 z−1 µ(dz) is equal to e ϑ 1 −1 if ϑ 2 = 0, and +∞, otherwise. Hence, Θ β equals dom(K β ) = R × {0}. For a in ri(dom(J β )) = (0, +∞) × R\n(1+ln a 1 , 0) is the dual solution, and the effective dual solution g ∗ a identically equals a 1 . Since ϕg ∗ a is not µ-integrable the primal solution does not exist, by Proposition 1. Nevertheless, g ∗ a equals the generalized primal solution ˆ g a , by Proposition 2.\nAdditionally to (7), Bregman distances emerge also in the dual problem (3), via the following existence result.\nTheorem 3. Assuming the DCQ , for every a ∈ R d with K ∗ β (a) ﬁnite there exists a unique Z-measurable function h a such that\nAs a consequence, if the dual problem has a solution ϑ ∈ Θ β then h a equals g ∗ a = f ϑ . In general, (8) implies that whenever ϑ n is a maximizing sequence for ϑ, a − K β (ϑ), the Bregman distances B β (h a , f ϑ n ) tend to zero, and thus f ϑ n converges to h a locally in measure. The function h a in (8) is regarded as generalized dual solution for a, extending the concept of generalized maximum likelihood estimate introduced in [9] and explicitly constructed in [10]. Our current proof of Theorem 3 is non-constructive, except for the case of equal primal and dual values, when h a is equal to the generalized primal solution ˆ g a .\nThe set of the moment vectors Z ϕg dµ of all nonnegative functions g with ϕg integrable is a convex cone, referred to as the ϕ-cone cn ϕ (µ) of µ. It contains the effective domain of J β . In this section, the domain is described via faces of cn ϕ (µ).\nRecall that a subset C of R d is a cone if 0 ∈ C, and tx ∈ C whenever t > 0 and x ∈ C. A face of a convex set C is a nonempty convex subset F of C such that every closed line segment in C with a relative interior point in F is contained in F . The face is proper if F = C. A face of a convex cone is a convex cone.\nThe ϕ-cones will be studied via a new notion deﬁned next, for Borel measures Q on R d that are σ-ﬁnite on R d \\ {0}.\nDeﬁnition 1. The conic core cnc(Q) of Q is the intersection of all convex Borel cones with Q-negligible complements.\nA predecessor of this construction appeared ﬁrst in [8]: the convex core cc(Q) of Q is the intersection of all convex Borel sets with Q-negligible complements. By [10, Theorem 3],\ncc(Q) consists of the integrals R d x P (dx) where P is a probability measure dominated by Q.\nLemma 1. The closure of cnc(Q) coincides with the smallest closed convex cone with Q-negligible complement.\nLet µ ϕ denote the ϕ-image of µ. In general, it is not σ-ﬁnite. Lemma 2. If ν is a measure equivalent to µ and the image ν ϕ is σ-ﬁnite on R d \\ {0} then cn ϕ (µ) = cnc(ν ϕ ).\nHere, Q cl (F ) denotes the restriction of Q to cl (F ). Hence, the ϕ-cone of the restriction of µ to ϕ −1 (cl (F )) equals F , and µ(ϕ −1 (cl (F ))) > 0 except perhaps for F = {0}.\nxP (dx) for all ﬁnite (or σ-ﬁnite) measures P dominated by Q such that x is P -integrable.\nIt follows that cnc(Q) equals the conic hull of cc(Q). The faces of the two sets are not related to each other in general. However, if Q is concentrated on a hyperplane that does not contain the origin then there is a bijection between the families of faces of cc(Q) and cnc(Q), up to the face {0} of the latter: the faces of cnc(Q) are the conic hulls of the faces of cc(Q). In particular, this takes place for Q = µ ϕ whenever one coordinate of ϕ is 1, a fact that has been used in [11].\nLemma 4. The moment vector Z ϕg dµ of a function g 0 with the ϕg integrable belongs to a face F of cn ϕ (µ) if and only if g(z) = 0 for µ-a.a. z ∈ Z with ϕ(z) / ∈ cl (F ).\nLet F β denote the family of faces F of cn ϕ (µ) such that the positive part of the integral {ϕ / ∈cl(F )} β(·, 0) dµ is ﬁnite. The improper face cn ϕ (µ) belongs to F β , and if F ⊆ G are faces of cn ϕ (µ) and F belongs to F β then so does also G.\nAnother consequence is that Z β(·, 0) dµ < +∞ is a sufﬁcient condition for dom(J β ) = cn ϕ (µ). This condition is also necessary when {0} is a face of cn ϕ (µ) and ϕ = 0, µ-a.e., in particular, when one coordinate of ϕ identically equals 1.\nExample 2. Let Z = R × {0, 1} and µ = µ 1 × µ 2 where µ 1 is a ﬁnite measure on R equivalent to the Lebesgue measure and µ 2 is the counting measure. Let the moment mapping be given by ϕ(z) = (1, z 1 , z 2 ), z = (z 1 , z 2 ) ∈ Z. Then the ϕ-cone of µ equals the sum of the sets\nIn this section, the primal problem is studied when the value J β (a) is ﬁnite but the PCQ is not assumed, a ∈ ri (dom(J β )). The main idea is to replace the measure µ by its restriction to the set {ϕ ∈ cl (F )} ϕ −1 (cl (F )) where F is an appro- priate face of the ϕ-cone cn ϕ (µ). To indicate this, the letter F is added to indices, e.g. G F,a denotes the class of Z- measurable functions g : Z → [0, +∞) such that the integral\nwhere H F,β (g) \t {ϕ∈cl(F )} β(z, g(z)) µ(dz), is the F -primal problem and the maximization in\nwhere K F,β (ϑ) \t {ϕ∈cl(F )} β ∗ z, ϑ, ϕ(z) µ(dz), is the F - dual problem for a. If the F -primal value J F,β (a) is ﬁnite and attained then the minimizers vanishing outside {ϕ ∈ cl (F )} deﬁne the µ-unique F -primal solution g F,a for a. The gener- alized F -primal solution ˆ g F,a is deﬁned likewise.\nLet the set Θ F,β consist of those ϑ ∈ dom(K F,β ) for which the function r → β ∗ (z, r) is ﬁnite around r = ϑ, ϕ(z) for µ-a.a. z ∈ Z with ϕ(z) ∈ cl (F ). For ϑ ∈ Θ F,β let f F,ϑ (z) equal (β ∗ ) (z, ϑ, ϕ(z) ) if ϕ(z) ∈ cl (F ) and the derivative exists, and zero otherwise.\nThe assumption Θ F,β = ∅ plays the role of DCQ in the F -dual problem and is weaker than the DCQ for the original problem (3). The role of PCQ in the F -primal problem for a with J β (a) ﬁnite is played by the assumption that a ∈ ri (F ). Under these assumptions, the standard results under PCQ and DCQ imply attainment in the F -dual problem for a ∈ R d , where each F -dual solution ϑ belongs to Θ F,β and gives rise to the same function f F,ϑ . This function is referred to as the effective F -dual solution g ∗ F,a for a.\nFor a ∈ cn ϕ (µ) let F (a) denote the unique face of cn ϕ (µ) whose relative interior contains a.\n(i) the F (a)-dual value K ∗ F (a),β (a) is attained and the pri- mal value J β (a) equals {ϕ / ∈cl(F (a))} β(·, 0) dµ + K ∗ F (a),β (a),\n(ii) the primal solution g a exists if and only if Θ F (a),β is not empty and the moment vector of g ∗ F (a),a exists and equals a, in which case g a = g ∗ F (a),a ,\n(iii) the generalized primal solution ˆ g a exists if and only if Θ F (a),β is not empty, in which case ˆ g a = g ∗ F (a),a .\nIf J β equals −∞ at some point then J ∗ β is identically +∞ and the dual problems (3) bear no information on the primal ones. However, Theorem 6 makes sense since J β can still be ﬁnite at some point a and the F (a)-dual problem provides complete understanding of the primal problem for this a. This situation is illustrated in [12, Example 10.7].\nDeﬁnition 2. The extension exn(F β ) of the family F β is deﬁned as union of the families F F,β = {f F,ϑ : ϑ ∈ Θ F,β } over the faces F of cn ϕ (µ).\nCorollary 1. For a ∈ R d with J β (a) ﬁnite the primal solution g a exists if and only if the families exn(F β ) and G a intersect, in which case the intersection equals {g a }.\nThe following result seems to be the most general version of Pythagorean identity.\nThe generalized primal solution ˆ g a in (9) is described explic- itly by Theorem 6(iii).\nThe function h is assumed to be nonnegative, Z-measurable and h(z) > 0 if β + (z, 0) = −∞. Then, for t 0\nis an integrand denoted by [βh], and g → B β (g, h) = H [βh] (g) is a functional of the form (1). It follows that the inﬁmum in (10) equals J [βh] (a) and the minimization is in the framework of the primal problem (2). A (generalized) primal solution is renamed to a (generalized) Bregman projection of h to G a .\nThe dual problem to (10) features the function K [βh] , see (4) with β replaced by [βh]. The crucial set Θ [βh] consists of those ϑ in dom(K [βh] ) that satisfy\nThe DCQ holds because ϑ = 0 always belongs to Θ [βh] . The family F [βh] is parameterized by ϑ ∈ Θ [βh] and consists of the functions given µ-a.e. by\nSince [βh] 0, the PCQ reduces to a ∈ ri (dom(J [βh] )). Assuming J [βh] ≡ +∞, thus existence of a and g ∈ G a with B β (g, h) ﬁnite, the relative interiors of dom(J [βh] ) and cn ϕ (µ) coincide, by Theorem 5. Thus, the PCQ is equivalent to the condition a ∈ ri (cn ϕ (µ)), not depending on h.\nTheorems 6 and 7 can be reformulated as follows. In these reformulations, in addition to restricting µ, the integrand β is replaced by [βh], as indicated in indices. Accordingly, (F, [βh])-problems, (F, [βh])-solutions, etc., come into play.\n(ii) the Bregman projection g [βh],a of h to G a exists if and only if the moment vector of the effective (F (a), [βh])- dual solution g ∗ F (a),[βh],a exists and equals a, in which case\n(iii) the generalized Bregman projection ˆ g [βh],a of h to G a exists and equals g ∗ F (a),[βh],a .\nA new feature here is the presence of two kinds of Bregman distances, based on β and [βh].\nLemma 5. For any nonnegative Z-measurable functions g, ˜ g on Z, B β (g, ˜ g) B [βh] (g, ˜ g), with equality if β(z, ·) is diffe- rentiable at t = h(z) for µ-a.a. z ∈ Z with h(z) > 0.\nIn particular, for β(z, ·) differentiable at each t > 0, z ∈ Z, the two Bregman distances coincide. In that case, Theorem 9 implies that if the Bregman projection g [βh],a exists, then\nIf β is even essentially smooth then h > 0, the correction term in Theorem 9 vanishes, and (11) becomes an equality, which is the usual Pythagorean identity for Bregman distances.\nIf β is not differentiable, the Pythagorean inequality (11) may fail.\nExample 3. Let β be autonomous, given by γ differentiable except at t = 1, let µ be a probability measure on (Z, Z) and ϕ ≡ 1. Then, G a consists of the nonnegative Z-measurable functions whose µ-integral equals a. For the function h ≡ 1 and a > 0, the Bregman distance B β (g, h) equals\nThis is minimized subject to g ∈ G a when g ≡ a, by Jensen inequality. In other words, the Bregman projection g [βh],a of h to G a exists and equals identically a. By a simple calculation,\nwhen 0 < a < 1, Z γ(g) dµ is ﬁnite and the set {g > 1} is not µ-negligible.\nThe choice h = f ϑ , for some ϑ ∈ Θ β , meets the running assumption and is of special interest.\nTheorem 10. If β is differentiable, J β ≡ +∞ and ϑ ∈ Θ β satisﬁes ϑ, ϕ β + (·, 0), µ-a.e., then dom(J β ) = dom(J [βf ϑ ] ) and for a ∈ dom(J β )\nThis identity implies that the generalized primal solution ˆ g a from Theorem 6(iii) coincides with the generalized Bregman\nprojection of f ϑ to G a , and that the existence of a sequence g n in G a with B β (g n , f ϑ ) → 0 is sufﬁcient for ˆ g a = f ϑ , extending the ﬁrst assertion of Proposition 1. If β is essentially smooth then each ϑ ∈ Θ β meets the hypothesis of Theorem 10, but this need not be so if β is merely differentiable. For ϑ ∈ Θ β not meeting that hypothesis, the above assertions may fail already for the autonomous integrand β given by γ(t) = t 2 , t 0, see [12, Example 10.11].\nThe work on this contribution was supported by the Hungar- ian National Foundation for Scientiﬁc Research under Grant K76088, and by Grant Agency of the Czech Republic under Grants P202/10/0618 and 201/08/0539."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
