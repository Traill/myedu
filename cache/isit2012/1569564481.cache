It is expected that R[f ] = R[X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ] if f is the identity function, while in general it is easily seen that R[X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ] ⊆ R[f ]. Based on the method of Elias [3] (cf. [4]), K¨orner and Marton [5] show that if f is the modulo- two sum ⊕, R[⊕] contains the convex hull of the union of R[X 1 , X 2 ] and R ⊕ , where\nSubsequently, by combining the standard source coding tech- nique and Elias\u2019 Lemma, Ahlswede and Han [6] gave an inner bound of R[⊕] which is larger than K¨orner and Marton\u2019s in general.\nOther variations of the general function computing problem have been studied in existing literature. As a special case, the original source coding problem is the ﬁrst example with the identity function to be computed. In [7], the scenario where one of the two sources is intactly known by the decoder is considered. The idea of characteristic graph [8] is used in random code construction. On the other hand, the correspond- ing channel coding problems in which the receiver(s) is (are) interested in reproducing a function (distinct functions) of the output data of the source(s) from the channel or network output(s) are considered in [9], [10], [11]. The original MAC channel coding problem where the function to be reproduced is the identity function is a special case of this class of problems. A certain type of MAC channel is studied in [9]. [10], [11] consider the problem in the setting of network coding.\nIn this paper, we focus on the source coding problem of computing a discrete function of several correlated sources. The observation that all discrete functions are restrictions of polynomial functions serves as an important factor which works underneath our method. Basically, the structure of the function considered is what distinguishes this function com- puting problem from the Slepian\u2013Wolf source coding problem. Hence, the algebraic structure of a function unveiled by its\npolynomial presentation is of great importance. Introducing this algebraic tool to the computing problem is one of the contributions of this paper. By treating discrete functions as polynomial functions, we point out that it is possible to enlarge the coding rate region (compared to the Slepian\u2013Wolf region) for certain types of polynomial functions (see Theorem III.3, Theorem III.4 and Corollary III.5). In particular, inspired by the research of Han and Kobayashi [1], for the two-sources scenario, we show that the coding rate region for a given function is strictly bigger than the Slepian\u2013Wolf region if and only if this function admits a \u201cnice\u201d polynomial presentation (see Theorem III.6 for more details).\nCapital letters X, Y, Z, · · · are used to denote random variables and X , Y, Z, · · · correspond to their respective sam- ple spaces. In addition, lower case letters x, y, z, · · · are used to denote instances of random variables. For a ﬁxed n, X n , Y n , Z n , · · · represent i.i.d sequences of length n, respectively. X (i) is for the ith term of X n , X [i) is for the i.i.d sequence X (i) , X (i+1) , · · · , X (n) and X [i] is for the i.i.d sequence X (1) , X (2) , · · · , X (i−1) , X (i+1) , X (i+2) , · · · , X (n) .\nLet X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s be s correlated random variables. X J is deﬁned to be the array of random variables X j 1 , X j 2 , · · · , X j k , where {j 1 , j 2 , · · · , j k } = J ⊆ {1, 2, · · · , s}. The deﬁnitions of X n J , X (i) J , X [i) J and X [i] J resemble such a deﬁnition.\nIn this paper, we assume that, for (X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ) ∼ p, p X i (x) > 0, ∀ x ∈ X i and ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ s, where p X i is the marginal of p, because if p X i (x) = 0 for some x ∈ X i , then we can assume that X i is deﬁned on X i \\{x} rather than X i . In addition, X i is not a function of X 1 , · · · , X i−1 , X i+1 , · · · , X s for all feasible i. This implies that |X i | ≥ 2, ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ s.\ning problem for computing, since only those values (of the function) deﬁned over the support inﬂuence the problem.\nIn this section, we demonstrate how a discrete function can be treated as a polynomial function. Readers who are familiar with algebra could skip this section.\nDeﬁnition II.1.

In the above lemma, Z p can be replaced by F p m , where p m ≥ max {|f (D)|, |X i | | 1 ≤ i ≤ k }. Interested read- ers can refer to [12, Lemma 7.40] for details. For completeness and to help understanding, we provide a proof of Lemma II.4.\nProof of Lemma II.4: By (1) and Fermat\u2019s little theorem, it is easy to see that the number of polynomial functions in Z p [k] is p p k . Moreover, the number of distinct functions with domain Z k p and codomain Z p is also p p k . Hence, any function g : Z k p → Z p is a polynomial function.\nIn the mean while, it is easy to ﬁnd injections η i : X i → Z p , ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ k and θ : f (D) → Z p , which implies that f is equivalent to a restriction of some polynomial function h : Z k p → Z p .\nIn Lemma II.4, polynomial function h is called the polyno- mial presentation of f .\nRemark 3. Lemma II.4 says that all discrete functions are polynomial functions up to the equivalent relation deﬁned in Deﬁnition II.2. This gives a more sophisticated algebraic structure to those functions to be considered. Such a structure will facilitate our further discussion.\nBy Lemma II.4, we can restrict our discussion to poly- nomial functions, so all the functions considered later have domains and codomains as subsets of ﬁnite ﬁelds. For s random variables X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s , it is easily seen that the SW region R[X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ] gives an inner bound of the\ncoding rate region for computing any discrete function f , i.e., R[X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ] ⊆ R[f ]. We consider, in the following, under what condition(s) that R[X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ] R[f ].\nLemma III.1 (Elias\u2019 Lemma [3]).

The Theorem III.2 is a direct generalization of the result by Ahlswede and Han [6, Theorem 10], and its proof is similar to theirs. It resumes [6, Theorem 10] if s = 2, F = Z 2 and g and h i \u2019s are identity functions.\nRemark 5. A function could have different polynomial pre- sentations over distinct ﬁnite ﬁelds. For example, the function min{x, y} deﬁned on {0, 1} × {0, 1} can either be seen as F 1 (x, y) = xy on Z 2 2 or be treated as the restriction of F 2 (x, y) = x + y − (x + y) 2 (on Z 2 3 ) to the domain {0, 1} × {0, 1} ⊂ Z 2 3 . Consequently, let F be the set of all polynomial presentations of f with format (2) and V be the set of all V N\nwhere R(F, V N ) is given by (3) and cov(D) is deﬁned to be the convex hull of set D ⊆ R s .\nis successfully recovered by the decoder, so is the func- tion f . Therefore, achievability follows from the fact that (R 1 , R 2 , · · · , R s ) that satisﬁes (3) is achievable for computing\ndistribution (X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ) ∼ p, if f | supp(p) is a restriction of some F ∈ F[s] which admits the structure\nwhere g ∈ F[s], and (h 1 , h 2 , · · · , h s )| supp(p) is not injective, then R[X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ] R[f ].\n \n \n(h 1 , h 2 , · · · , h s )| supp(p) is not injective in Theorem III.3 im- plies that there exists 1 ≤ l ≤ s and a = b ∈ X l , such that OL(a, b, l, p) = ∅ and h l (a) = h l (b). Consequently,\nIn fact, if a discrete function f satisﬁes (6) for some nonempty OL(a, b, l, p), then f | supp(p) has polynomial presentation (5) and h l | X l is not injective. See Lemma A.1 for details.\ni.e., h| Λ is not injective, then there exists distribution (X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ) ∼ q with supp(q) = Λ such that R[X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ] R[f ].\nProof: Let (X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ) ∼ q and supp(q) = Λ. (7) implies that H(Z) < H(X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ), where Z = h(X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ). Furthermore, there exists some small δ > 0 and q 0 with supp(q 0 ) = Λ, such that sH(Z) + δ < H(X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ) if q = q 0 . Meanwhile, it can be shown that by Elias\u2019 Lemma R i = δ s + 1 + H(Z), ∀1 ≤ i ≤ s,\nH(X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ) which implies R[X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ] R[f ] if q = q 0 .\nRemark 7.

In Theorem III.4, condition (7) can be replaced by\nf −1 (ω 0 ) Λ . We know that the polynomial function g − ω 0 has at most Deg(g − ω 0 ) = Deg(g) zeros. Thus, h| Λ is not injective, otherwise, g − ω 0 has at least ρ zeros. ρ > Deg(g), a contradiction.\nRemark 8. The min function in Remark 5 together with its polynomial presentation F 2 gives an example of functions illustrated in Theorem III.4 and Corollary III.5.\nTheorem III.6. Fix the support of all distributions considered to be Λ ⊆ X 1 × X 2 . For function f : X 1 × X 2 → Ω, there exists joint distribution (X 1 , X 2 ) ∼ p with supp(p) = Λ such that R[X 1 , X 2 ] R[f ], if and only if f | Λ is a restriction of some F ∈ F[2] which admits the structure\nRemark 9. Theorem III.6 says that, in the case s = 2, the necessary condition of Theorem III.4 is also sufﬁcient.\nProof of Theorem III.6: ⇐ follows from Theorem III.4. The other direction, ⇒, is proved in Appendix B.\nRemark 10. Essentially, Theorem III.6 gives another interpre- tation of [1, Theorem 1]. In the case of Λ = X 1 ×X 2 , one way to prove Theorem III.6 is to show that its sufﬁcient condition is equivalent to the inverses of (3.1), (3.11) and (3.13) of [1].\nConsidering discrete functions as polynomial functions pro- vides several advantages. A polynomial presentation gives a function a much more sophisticated algebraic structure compared to its matrix presentation. This could facilitate investigating properties of the function and unearthing useful information. In Theorem III.4, we have seen that a \u201cnice\u201d summing structure can be utilized via the linear random coding technique to obtain a bigger coding rate region. For the two- sources scenario, Theorem III.6 claims that such a summing structure is the only valuable one in terms of enlarging the coding rate region. To the best of our knowledge, for the multiple-sources scenario, the question of what is the sufﬁ- cient and necessary condition so that the coding rate region coincides with the SW region is unanswered (see [1]). We\nexpect that this polynomial approach will provide additional insight into this problem in the future.\nLemma A.1. Let (X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X s ) ∼ p. A discrete function f satisﬁes (6) for some nonempty OL(a, b, l, p) with a = b ∈ X l ( 1 ≤ l ≤ s), if and only if f | supp(p) has polynomial presentation (5) and (h 1 , h 2 , · · · , h s )| supp(p) is not injective.\nProof: Without loss of generality, assume that l = 1, and let Λ = supp(p). If f satisﬁes (6) for a nonempty OL(a, b, 1, p)\na; if c ∈ {a, b}, c; otherwise.\nwhere h i (x) = x, ∀ 2 ≤ i ≤ s, is the required polynomial presentation of f | Λ . Moreover, (h 1 , h 2 , · · · , h s )| Λ is not in- jective, since h 1 (a) = h 1 (b). Sufﬁciency is obvious.\nMoreover, if f (a 1 , a 2 , · · · , a k ) = f (b 1 , b 2 , · · · , b k ) and a i = b i , ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ k, then f is equivalent to g ◦ h p | D\nProof: Let D = D 1 ×D 2 ×· · ·×D k and η i be the bijection from [0, m i − 1] to D i given by η i : t → td i . It is easy to verify that h p | D is injective. Besides, there exists injection θ :\n∀ t i ∈ [0, m i − 1], ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ k. (10) By Lemma II.4, g ∈ Z p [1]. By deﬁnition, f is equivalent to\nFurthermore, if f (a) = f (b 1 , b 2 , · · · , b k ), where a = (a 1 , a 2 , · · · , a k ), and a i = b i , ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ k, without loss of generality, assume that a i = m i − 1, ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, a k = b 1 = b 2 = · · · = b k−1 = 0 and b k = 1.

Similarly, there exists g ∈ Z p [1], such that (10) holds true for g = g . Therefore, f is equivalent to g ◦ h p | D\nR[X 1 , X 2 ] \t R[f ] implies that there exists (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ R[f ] while (R 1 , R 2 ) / ∈ R[X 1 , X 2 ]. That is, for some ﬁxed δ > 0, R 1 < H(X 1 |X 2 ) − δ, or R 2 < H(X 2 |X 1 ) − δ or R 1 +\nR 2 < H(X 1 , X 2 ) − δ. Moreover, ∀ > 0, there exists a big enough n, two encoders E 1 , E 2 and one decoder D, such that Pr {Z n = D(E 1 (X n 1 ), E 2 (X n 2 ))} < , where Z = f (X 1 , X 2 ).\nwhere A is a random variable which is uniformly distributed over {1, 2, · · · , n} and independent to all the other random variables. Suppose\nLet X i = X (A) i , Z = Z (A) , Q i = (X [A] i , A) and V i = (W i , X A−1 i ) for i = 1, 2. Then H(X J |V 1 , V 2 , X J c , Q J c ) > δ\nand > H(Z|V 1 , V 2 , X J c , Q J c ) by (11) and (12). Moreover, V 1 − X 1 − X 2 − V 2 |Q j forms a Markov chain for all j = 1, 2. By the Caratheodory theorem, Q 1 , Q 2 , V 1 and V 2 can be re- placed, respectively, by new random variables Q 1, , Q 2, , V 1,\nand V 2, whose sample spaces are bounded by a ﬁxed ﬁnite number ρ. At the same time, H(X J |V 1, , V 2, , X J c , Q J c , ) > δ, > H(Z|V 1, , V 2, , X J c , Q J c , ) and V 1, , −X 1 − X 2 −\nNow, let \t go to 0, the continuity of entropy guar- antees that H(X J | ˜ V 1 , ˜ V 2 , X J c , ˜ Q J c ) ≥ δ and 0 = H(Z| ˜ V 1 , ˜ V 2 , X J c , ˜ Q J c ) for new random variables ˜ Q 1 , ˜ Q 2 , ˜ V 1 and ˜ V 2 whose pmf \u2019s are the limit pmf \u2019s of Q 1, , Q 2, , V 1,\nand V 2, , respectively. Furthermore, ˜ V 1 − X 1 − X 2 − ˜ V 2 | ˜ Q j forms a Markov chain for all j = 1, 2.\n1) If J = {1}, i.e., H(X 1 | ˜ V 1 , ˜ V 2 , X 2 , ˜ Q 2 ) ≥ δ, then there exist a = b ∈ X 1 and c ∈ X 2 , such that f (a, c) = f (b, c) since 0 = H(Z| ˜ V 1 , ˜ V 2 , X 2 , ˜ Q 2 ). On the other hand, since ˜ V 1 − X 1 − X 2 − ˜ V 2 | ˜ Q 2 is a Markov chain, then ∀ x 2 ∈ X 2 with p(a, x 2 )p(b, x 2 ) > 0, f (a, x 2 ) = f (b, x 2 ). Otherwise, 0 < H(Z| ˜ V 1 , ˜ V 2 , X 2 , ˜ Q 2 ), a con- tradiction. By Lemma A.1 and the ﬁrst half of Lemma A.2, f | Λ has polynomial presentation (9) with a non- injective k 1 . Hence, k 1 + k 2 | Λ is not injective. Similar conclusion can be drawn if J = {2}.\n2) If J = {1, 2}, i.e., H(X 1 , X 2 | ˜ V 1 , ˜ V 2 ) ≥ δ, then there exist (a, c) = (b, d) ∈ Λ, such that f (a, c) = f (b, d). If c = d (or a = b), then H(X 1 | ˜ V 1 , ˜ V 2 , X 2 , ˜ Q 2 ) ≥ δ (or H(X 2 | ˜ V 1 , ˜ V 2 , X 1 , ˜ Q 1 ) ≥ δ). Then the same conclusion is reached by the same argument as in 1). Assume that a = b and c = d. By the second half of Lemma A.2, f | Λ processes a polynomial presentation (9) with non- injective k 1 + k 2 | Λ ."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"T. S. Han"},{"name":"K.
