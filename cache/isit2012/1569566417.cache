While such covert relays increase anonymity, they cause performance degradation by delaying or dropping packets. In this paper, we propose ﬂow allocation methods that maximize anonymity for multipath wireless networks with predetermined covert relay nodes, while taking into account packet-loss as a constraint. Using a rate-distortion framework, we show how to assign probabilities which split the ﬂows from source to destination among all possible routes and show that selecting routes according to the assigned probabilities achieves maximum anonymity given the packet-loss constraint."},"body":{"text":"In applications requiring anonymous wireless communica- tion, the identities of source-destination pairs for each data ﬂow should be untraceable. Due to the open wireless medium, however, an eavesdropper can record timing information about transmitted packets. If intermediate relays forward messages as soon as they are received, the timing of the outgoing and incoming messages at each relay will be correlated. An eavesdropper can then use trafﬁc analysis to infer source- destination pairs.\nDesigning reliable relays against timing-based trafﬁc anal- ysis is necessary for anonymous networks [1]-[3]. In [4], the authors showed that, by designing a series of network relays to embed the packet to be forwarded within a series of dummy packets (called \u201cchaff packets\u201d), the forwarding time of the received packet can be randomized in a way that prevents timing-based trafﬁc analysis. Relays with randomized forwarding times are denoted covert relays, while other relays are denoted visible relays [5]. While eavesdroppers are able to trace packets through visible relays, they are unable to trace packets through covert relays. Furthermore, in order to minimize congestion and delays, covert relays may drop received packets [5]. Consequently, routing packets through covert relays preserves the anonymity of the source-destination pairs, but at the cost of reduced throughput and higher packet- loss.\nIn [5] and [8], the authors introduced the problem of selecting relays as covert and visible based on throughput and anonymity, under the assumption that each source-destination pair uses a single route. In typical wireless networks, however, each source has more than one possible route to the same destination.\nGiven a set of covert and visible relays, different routes will yield different packet-loss as well as different level of\nanonymity for the same source-destination pair. To date, the problem of selecting routes with maximum anonymity while minimizing packet-loss for a set of source-destination pairs is yet to be studied.\nIn this work, given a multipath wireless network with covert and visible relays, we investigate how to analytically choose routes for each source-destination pair in order to offer maximum anonymity while maintaining a packet-loss con- straint. We consider two sources of packet-loss: link quality, determined by transmission power and the distance between nodes, and packets dropped by covert relays. We formulate the route selection problem within a rate-distortion framework, in which the fraction of ﬂow allocated to each route is chosen to maximize the network anonymity without violating packet- loss constraints.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we deﬁne the system and adversary models. In Section III, we formulate route selection as a rate-distortion problem and present solution algorithms. Section IV illustrates our results through simulation study. Section V concludes the paper.\nAs in [5], we consider global eavesdroppers with knowledge of the network topology and ability to observe all network nodes. We assume that packets are encrypted so that eaves- droppers cannot expose source-destination pairs by reading packet headers. The goal of the eavesdroppers is to identify source-destination pairs by using timing-based trafﬁc analysis.\nIn this section, we give the deﬁnition of covert and visible relays introduced in [5] and specify the notations that will be used for the rest of the paper.\nDeﬁnition 1 (Visible Relays). A visible relay is a relay in which adversaries are able to trace the forwarded packets back to the senders. When a sender node n i selects visible relay r j to forward packets, we denote this event by r n i j .\nAs illustrated in Figure 1(a), when visible relay r j is forwarding packets from n 1 , the adversary is able to deduce that these packets came from node n 1 . Hence, we use the superscript n 1 in r n 1 j to emphasize the adversary\u2019s knowledge of the source node.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Covert Relays). A covert relay transmits packets according to a pre-speciﬁed probabilistic schedule. When there are no packets to be forwarded, the covert relay transmits a dummy packet; otherwise, the covert relay forwards the ﬁrst packet in its buffer. When sender node n i selects covert relay r j to forward a packet, we denote this event as r j .\nBy assumption, adversaries are unable to trace packets by observing covert relays. As shown in Figure 1(a), if relay r j is covert, from the eavesdropper\u2019s viewpoint, the current outgoing packet could be coming from node n 1 , node n 2 , or node n 3 . Therefore, unlike the case of visible relays in Deﬁnition 1, the notation r j is used with no superscripts to emphasize that the adversary cannot associate a source node with the observed packets.\nDeﬁnition 3 (Super-node). If there are k covert relays within one hop of a sender node n i , the set of such k nodes is called a super-node. The event that any one of the k covert relays in the super-node is forwarding packets from n i is denoted by\nIn the example of Figure 1(b), when node n 1 sends a packet to covert relay r A , eavesdroppers are unable to determine (with certainty) which one of those three outgoing packets is from node n 1 . In other words, assuming node n 1 chose its next hop relay with equal probability, the three events that node n 1 is sending packets to covert relay r A , covert relay r B , or covert relay r are indistinguishable. Thus, we use the notation r ABC to represent the event that one of the covert relays r A , r B , or r C is forwarding a packet from node n 1 .\nWe consider a network with N sources and M destinations. Each source i chooses one of the M destinations to send packets independently of other sources, with transmission rate η i . We use Z i , which is a random variable taking a value from the destination set {D 1 , D 2 , ...D M }, to represent the source- destination pair of source i. We deﬁne P Z i (D j ) to be the probability of source i choosing destination D j . Let\nwhere the Z i \u2019s are independent of each other 1 . For source i with ˜ L th hop transmission, let the series of intermediate relay nodes selected by Z i be\nwhere R l ∈ {r n i j , r j , r i 1 i 2 ..i k } represents the l th forwarding relay, which can be either visible, covert or super-node, and the destination node at the ˜ L th hop. Deﬁne\nto be the routes used by the N sources in this network. We assume that each source chooses its route independently of other sources. Deﬁne packet-loss rate due to link-quality to be P l = L (Z i , R Z i ). Furthermore, to reduce latency, if packets stay in covert relays more than δ time units, they will be dropped [5]. For each route, deﬁne packet-loss due to packets dropped by covert relays to be P c = C (Z i , R Z i , δ ). (Different dropping strategies cause different dropping rates; interested readers can refer to [8] for more discussion about dropping rate function.)\nFor source i with transmission rate η i , and packet-loss rate P e (i), let the maximum average packet-loss rate the total network can afford be D =\nrepresents the fraction of total network throughput originated at source i. We use H (Z) to represent the uncertainty of all source-destination pairs. Since eavesdroppers can observe the timing information R, the uncertainty of the source-destination pairs to the eavesdropper after timing-based trafﬁc analysis is deﬁned as H (Z|R). As in [7], we express the network\u2019s anonymity degree by normalizing the uncertainty of all source- destination pairs as\nIf all the relays in the network are covert, then the timing of packet transmissions gives the eavesdropper no information about the source-destination pairs. Hence H (Z|R) = H(Z), resulting in the maximum anonymity of one.\nConsider the example of Figure 2 with R B as covert relay. The source-destination pairs, ( S 1 , D 1 ), ( S 2 , D 1 ) and ( S 3 , D 3 ), all have multiple routes. The problem considered in this paper is to ﬁnd the probabilities with which a ﬂow from a source must be allocated across different possible routes between that source and a speciﬁc destination in order to maximize anonymity while satisfying a packet-loss constraint.\nSince adversaries can eavesdrop and observe the routes chosen by sources, denoted by R, maximizing anonymity is equivalent to minimizing the source-destination pairs informa- tion available to eavesdroppers, given by H (Z)−H(Z|R) with the packet-loss rate as the penalty. Hence, the route selection\nis equivalent optimizing the rate-distortion function subject to the distortion D, which is the maximum average packet-loss rate system can admit:\nHere, d (Z, R) denotes distortion function deﬁned as the system average packet-loss rate arising from the route vector R with source-destination pairs Z.\nProof : Since each source chooses a route and destina- tion independently of other sources, H (Z) = N i =1 H (Z i ), H (Z|R) = N i =1 H (Z i |R), and H(Z i |R) = H(Z i |R Z i ) for\n1 ≤ i ≤ N . This implies R (D) = min\nLemma (1) shows that the problem of optimizing the network\u2019s overall anonymity is equivalent to optimizing the anonymity of each of the N independent sources individually. That is, ﬁnding the route for each source-destination pair that maximizes the anonymity of a given source-destination pair is independent of all other pairs in the network.\nWe deﬁne the distortion function for the formulation studied in this article by averaging the packet-loss rate from each route. Let Q Z i (R Z i = α|Z i = β) denote the probability that source i selects route α given the corresponding destination is β. Assuming the packet losses due to link-quality and packet- dropping by covert relays are independent, the packet-loss rate function can be expressed as\n \nUsing the condition j Q Z i (j|k) = 1 and system average packet loss rate not exceeding D, the optimization function with Lagrange multiplier can be written as\nWe consider the optimization of equation (8) under two different scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario, covert relays do not drop packets. In the second scenario, we incorporate packet- dropping by covert relays. In what follows, we discuss how to obtain Q Z i for these two scenarios.\nA. Route Selection Without Packet-Dropping by Covert Relays In this section, we consider the optimization problem of\nequation (8) assuming link-quality is the only source for packet loss. That is, we set the time constraint of the covert relays to δ = ∞. In this case, the packet-loss rate function in equation (7) reduces to F (k, j, δ, Q Z i (j|k)) = L (Z i , R Z i ). From [6,10], the roots of ∂J ∂Q\nq Z i (j) exp[sL(k, j)ζ i ] , \t (9) where q z i (j) = k P Z i (k)Q Z i (j|k) and L(k, j) represents the route\u2019s link-quality. As Equation (9) shows, Q Z i is computed by giving the input s. Each value of the parameter s corre- sponds to a different choice of D, so that varying s allows us to compute the anonymity-packet loss curve R (D) [6,10].\nB. Packet-Loss Rate from Link Quality and Packet-Dropping by Covert Relays\nWhen we apply time constraint to covert relays, covert relays drop the packets staying in buffer more than δ time units [5]. This increase packet-loss rate. However, the dropping rate in here is also dependent on the ﬂow allocation, which is denoted by Q Z i as described in [8]. Therefore, by solving\n(10) where\nT Z i = F (k, j, δ, Q Z i (j|k)) + Q Z i (j|k)F \u2032 (k, j, δ, Q Z i (j|k)), q z i (j) =\nand F \u2032 denotes the ﬁrst derivative of F with respect to Q Z i (j|k). In equation (10), exp[sT Z i ζ i ] contains the term Q Z i that needs to be estimated. Hence the root cannot be evaluated directly from Q Z i (j|k) = q Zi (j) exp[sT Zi ζ i ]\n, since it is a nonlinear polynomial. We present two numerical methods for obtaining Q Z i as follows.\n1) Newton-Raphson Method: Under the Newton-Raphson method for solving nonlinear systems of equations [9], we have\nwhere Q n Z i = [Q n Z i (α 1 |β), Q n Z i (α 2 |β), ...Q n Z i (α l |β)] T , and F = [f 1 , f 2 , ...f l ] T , for f j in equation (10). Q n Z i (α j |β) represents the value at n th iteration of each route α j , given the destination β via Newtons-Raphson method. After assigning arbitrary probability values for Q 0 Z i as initial vectors, all possible initial vectors converge to the same result by recursive equation (11).\n2) Taylor Series Expansion: Another approximation to resolve equation (10) is using Taylor series expansion. The procedure is as follows. 1) In equation (10), set λ =\nq Z i (j) exp[sT Z i ζ i ] and, using an arbitrary probability as the initial value for ´ a, expanding equation (10) as:\n2) Solving the polynomial equation (12) for each Q Z i (α j |β) in terms of λ by giving n th order approximation. Then all the roots can be described in terms of λ. 3) By using the property j Q Z i (α j |β)) = 1, we can solve for λ. Once we ﬁnd λ, we can obtain Q Z i (α j |β). 4) Let new ´ a equal to Q Z i (α j |β) obtained from 3), then repeat procedure 1), 2) and 3). Eventually, we can approach Q Z i (α j |β) using any initial value ´ a.\nAn iterative algorithm for obtaining Q Z i (j|k) is given as follows.\nIteration Procedure : Algorithm for route selection Input: Resolution, ∆ Time constraint, δ\nOutput: Probability for each route Q Z i (α j |β), j = 1, 2..l q Z i (α j ) ← 1 l , for j = 1, 2..l while n < I\nQ Z i (α j |β) ← eq. (9) for j = 1, 2..l else\nwhile m j > ∆ for j = 1, 2...l m j ← Q Z i (α j |β)\nCompute Q Z i (α j |β) ← by Newton-Raphson or Taylor Series method\nm j ← |m j − Q Z i | for j = 1, ..l end\nq Z i (α j ) ← k P Z i (k)Q Z i (α j |k) for j = 1, 2..l end while\nSince any initial distribution value of q Z i (α j ) will converge to the same result, we choose a uniform initial distribution. For a given slope s and iteration number I, the above procedure re- turns the optimal ﬂow allocation, represented by Q Z i (j|k). By varying the parameter s, a range of points on the anonymity- packet loss rate-distortion curve can be obtained.\nTo verify that our proposed algorithm is optimal, we com- pare our results with all possible probability assignments. For simulation, we assume that each source has the same transmission rate and Z i is uniformly distributed. For the network shown in Figure 2, with node B acting as a covert relay without time constraint, i.e., δ = ∞, we compare our proposed method with all possible probability distributions Q in Figure 3(a). The ﬁgure shows that our approach is optimal for this network topology.\nFigure 3(b) shows the performance with different covert relay conﬁgurations, including ( R B ), ( R A , R B ), and ( R A , R B , R C ) from Figure 2. When all relays are covert relays, there is no trade-off between packet-loss rate and anonymity. Figure 3(b) also shows the maximum anonymity that can be achieved as a function of the packet-loss constraint D. For example, when only relay R B is covert, given D is equal to 0.035, the maximum anonymity is 0.788. In order to achieve this maximum anonymity, the source-destination pair (S 1 , D 1 ) selects R A and R B to be 0.157 and 0.843, respectively.\nFigure 3(c) compares the Newton-Raphson and Taylor approximation algorithms for solving (10), with the time constraint δ set to 1, a maximum transmission rate of 3 for each node, and the dropping function described in [8] for ( R B ) as covert relay. We observe that both methods produce similar results, while the Taylor approximation does not require inverting a large matrix.\nIn this paper, we studied the problem of route selection in order to maximize anonymity in wireless networks subject to a constraint on packet loss. We formulated the problem within a rate-distortion framework, in which each node independently chooses a ﬂow allocation among multiple routes. We intro- duced algorithms for optimal route selection under two cases, namely the case where covert relays drop packets in order to avoid congestion, and the case where covert relays do not drop packets. We evaluated the performance of our algorithms in both cases via simulation study. While the example for simulation used the network in Figure 2, the formulation is applicable to wireless networks with multiple intermediate hops with prespeciﬁed covert relays.\nThe main focus of this work was to ﬁnd the optimal route selection for a given set of covert and visible relays with independent sources. In our future work, we will investigate ﬂow allocation when the sources are dependent. We will also study the problem of joint optimization of both the route\nselection and the assignment of relays as covert or visible for a given network."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
