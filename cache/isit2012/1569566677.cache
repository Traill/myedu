In this work we are interested primarily in interference channels (IC). The DoF of IC are known when all nodes are equipped with the same number of antennas for almost all channel realizations. However, if each node may have an arbitrary number of antennas, then a general DoF characterization is unavailable beyond the 2 user IC, due to the explosion of the number of parameters in considering arbitrary antenna conﬁgurations. However, as we show in this work, the problem involves fundamental challenges even when the number of parameters is restricted by symmetry. In particular, the difﬁculty is to deal with the new notion of \u201cdepth\u201d of overlap between vector subspaces that come into play on the one hand, and of translating this notion into information theoretic bounds on the other. Speciﬁcally, we will explore the simplest setting for MIMO IC where the DoF are unknown.\nAs the smallest and the most elementary IC setting where interference alignment becomes relevant, the 3 user IC has special signiﬁcance. The assumption of global channel knowl- edge, and comparable signal strengths from all transmitters to receivers that follows from the deﬁnition of the DoF metric, is most relevant to small clusters of (no more than 3) mutually interfering users. Let us start with a summary of related work.\nThe two user MIMO IC, where user k (k = 1,2) has M k transmit and N k receive antennas, was shown in [5] to have min(M 1 +M 2 ,N 1 +N 2 ,max(M 1 , N 2 ),max(M 2 , N 1 )) DoF. For this result, the achievability is based on linear zero forcing beamforming schemes, and the converse is based on DoF outer bounds for the multiple access channel. In [2], Cadambe and Jafar introduced an asymptotic interference alignment scheme, referred to as the [CJ08] scheme, leading to the result that in the K-user MIMO IC, each user can access half-the-cake almost surely (the \u201ccake\u201d refers to the maximum DoF of a user when all interfering users are absent), when all nodes are equipped with the same number of antennas and channels are time-varying or frequency-selective. In [9], Motahari et al. introduced the rational dimensions framework based on the diophantine approximation theory wherein the [CJ08] scheme is again applied to establish the same DoF result with constant channels. For the 3-user MIMO IC with M T = M R = M > 1, Cadambe and Jafar also present a closed form linear scheme in [2] to achieve the DoF outer bound value of M/2 per user, without the need for channel variations in time/frequency. The DoF outer bound in each of these cases is based on the pairwise outer bounds for any two users.\nIn [3], Gou and Jafar studied the DoF of the K-user M T × M R MIMO IC under the assumption that η = max(M T ,M R ) min(M T ,M R ) is an integer and showed that each user has a fraction η η+1 of the cake, almost surely, when K > η. While they use the [CJ08] scheme over time-varying/frequency-selective channels to show the optimal DoF achievability, in [9] Motahari et al. employ the rational dimensions framework combined with the [CJ08] scheme to establish the same DoF result with constant channels and without channel extensions. Further, they show that each user has a fraction η η+1 of the cake, even when η = max(M T ,M R ) min(M T ,M R ) is not an integer, provided K ≥ M T +M R gcd (M T ,M R ) . Interestingly, the achievability of η η+1 min(M T , M R ) DoF or equivalently M T M R M T +M R DoF per user, follows from the applica- tion of the [CJ08] scheme for every M T , M R value, and re- quires no joint signal processing between multiple antennas at either the transmitter or receiver sides. However, the optimality of the DoF has been shown only when K ≥ M T +M R gcd (M\n. Their outer bounds are merely based on cooperation DoF outer bounds as shown in [5]. When K < M T +M R gcd (M\n, the DoF region or even sum DoF remain unknown in general. In this paper we will explore DoF of these cases. Moreover, since outer bounds based on full cooperation are not enough in these\ncases, the challenge will be to identify the genie signals that will lead us to the desired conclusion.\nConsider a fully connected three-user MIMO interference channel where there are M T and M R antennas at each trans- mitter and receiver, respectively, each transmitter sending one independent message to its desired receiver. Denote by H ji the M R × M T channel matrix from transmitter i to receiver j where i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}. We assume that the channel coefﬁ- cients are independently drawn from continuous distributions. While our results are valid regardless of whether the channel coefﬁcients are constant or varying in time/frequency, we will assume the channels are constant in the exposition. Global channel knowledge is assumed to be available at all nodes.\nAt time index t ∈ Z + , Transmitter i sends a complex-valued M T × 1 signal vector ¯ X i (t), which satisﬁes an average power constraint 1 T T t=1 E[ ¯ X i (t) 2 ] ≤ ρ for T channel uses. At the receiver side, User j receives an M R × 1 signal vector ¯\nwhere ¯ Z j (t) an M R × 1 column vector representing the i.i.d. circularly symmetric complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at Receiver j, each entry of which is an i.i.d. Gaussian random variable with zero-mean and unit-variance.\nLet R k (ρ) denote the achievable rate of User k where ρ is also referred to as the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The concepts of capacity and DoF follow from the standard deﬁnitions thus omitted here. Assume that the sum rate of this channel is denoted as R Σ , and R = R Σ /3 denotes the rate normalized per user. The sum DoF of this channel are deﬁned as d Σ (M T , M R ), and d = d Σ /3 stands for the DoF per user. Also, we use d k to denote the number of DoF associated with User k, and the user index k is interpreted modulo 3 so that, e.g., User 0 is the same as User 3. Furthermore, we deﬁne the DoF normalized by the spatial dimension, DoF Σ (M T , M R ) as\nand DoF (M T , M R ) = DoF Σ (M T , M R )/3 is similarly deﬁned. The dependence on M T , M R may be dropped when no ambi- guity would be caused. Also, the notation o(x) represents any function f(x) such that lim x→∞ f(x)/x = 0.\nwhere M = min(M T , M R ), N = max(M T , M R ), κ = M N−M . The quantity κ denotes the length of the subspace\nalignment chain, to be described later. Clearly, as N and M become approximately equal ( κ → 1), DoF converges to the \u201chalf the cake\u201d value, M/2. To arrive at the main result of this paper, we proceed through two intermediate lemmas here.\nLemma 1 (Outer Bound): For the 3-user M T ×M R MIMO IC, the DoF value per user is bounded above as d ≤ DoF .\nLemma 2 (Inner Bound): For the 3-user M T × M R MIMO IC, the DoF per user value DoF is achievable with linear\nbeamforming over constant channels without the need for symbol extensions in time, frequency or space.\nProof: Due to the space limitation, we only provide the proofs for Lemma 1 through two speciﬁc examples in the next section, to shed light on intuition behind the complicated mathematic derivations. The general proofs of Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 are presented in the full paper [1].\nTheorem 1 (Spatially-Normalized DoF): For the 3-user M T × M R MIMO IC, the spatially-normalized degrees of freedom value per user is given by DoF = DoF .\nFor the 3-user M T × M R MIMO IC, the DoF value demand per user, d, is feasible with linear interference alignment if and only if d ≤ DoF .\nProof: The proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 follow directly from Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, and are presented in [1].\nRemark 1: The information theoretic DoF outer bound holds for arbitrary values of M T , M R without any spatial normalization. On the other hand, the DoF achievability is es- tablished in general subject to a normalization with respect to spatial-extensions, i.e., the scaling of the number of antennas at all nodes. Moreover, symbol extensions in time or frequency over constant channels combined with asymmetric complex signaling are sufﬁcient to achieve the optimal DoF. We carry out this test to establish the DoF values for all ( M, N ) values up to M, N ≤ 10. In general, we end with the conjecture that in all cases, the DoF outer bound value in Lemma 1 is tight 1 .\nConsider an arbitrary ( M T , M R ) pair. If M = N, then half- the-cake DoF results are reported in [2]. Since the DoF results for 2 M ≤ N are simple where interference alignment is not required, we only consider 2 M > N in the following.\nWe now introduce the key new concept of subspace align- ment chains from the linear dimension counting argument. For brevity, we ﬁrst suppose M R ≥ M T , which implies that zero- forcing at the transmitters is not possible. Since interference\ncannot be eliminated, it is desirable to align interference. Let us consider a vector V 1(1) sent by T 1 that causes interference at R 2 . This vector should align with a vector V 3(1) sent by T 3 , which is also undesired at R 2 . Since V 3(1) also causes interference at R 1 , it should align there with a vector V 2(1) sent by T 2 . The vector V 2(1) in turn also causes interference to R 3 , so it should align with a vector V 1(2) sent from T 1 . Continuing like this, we create a chain of desired alignments:\nThe main question is can we extend this subspace alignment chain indeﬁnitely? Consider the setting M = N previously solved in [2]. Cadambe and Jafar create this inﬁnite chain of alignments using the asymptotic alignment scheme for M = N =1, and implicitly create an inﬁnite alignment chain in the non-asymptotic solution for, e.g., M = N = 2, as the chain closes upon itself to form a loop, i.e., V 1(1) = V 1(2) . The chain closes upon itself mainly because the optimal signal vectors are eigenvectors of the cumulative channel encountered in traversing the alignment chain starting from any transmitter and continuing until we return to the same transmitter. Thus, the ideal solution of perfect alignment, achieved by an inﬁnite (or closed-loop) alignment chain, is possible if M = N [2].\nFor general M, N , the subspace alignment chain can neither be continued indeﬁnitely, nor be made to close upon itself. While we show the chain in detail in [1], here we provide an intuition behind the results in Theorem 1. For any values of M T M R ∈ [ p−1 p , p p+1 ], the ﬁrst bound d ≤ κN 2κ+1 is from the M T < M R setting. In this case, the length of the subspace alignment chains, deﬁned as the times of the chain appearing at the transmitter side, cannot be larger than κ = p = M N−M . This observation yields the intuition that if a total of κd 0 dimensions are sent, they will create interference spaces of (κ + 1)d 0 dimensions. The desired signals and interference together need a total of κd 0 +(κ+1)d 0 =(2κ+1)d 0 dimensions. Since only 3 N dimensions are available, we must have d 0 ≤\n3N 2κ+1 . Because each user sends κd 0 /3 dimensions, we obtain the N -bound d ≤ κN 2κ+1 . The second M -bound, d ≤ κM 2κ−1 can be understood for the M T > M R setting with 2 κ+1 in previous case replaced with 2 κ − 1. We provide an example in Fig.1 to show how we obtain the N -bound and M -bound, where we use the solid lines to denote the corresponding subspace involving in the alignment operations. The subspace alignment chain, for example in Fig.1(a), is V 1(1) Rx 3 ↔V 2(1) Rx 1 ↔V 3(1) Rx 2 ↔ V 1(2) , which has length 4. Therefore, the limited length of the subspace alignment chain creates the bottleneck on the extent to which interference can be aligned, and is ultimately the main factor determining the DoF value.\n1) Redundant Dimensions: A particularly interesting obser- vation from Theorem 1 and Fig.2 is that within each piecewise linear interval, the DoF value depends only on either M or N . This makes the other parameter somewhat redundant, i.e., it can be reduced without reducing the DoF. The corner points of these piecewise linear segments correspond to two sets, A = { 1 2 , 2 3 , 3 4 , · · · } and B = { 1 3 , 3 5 , 5 7 , · · · }. The set A contains\nall those values of M N for which there is redundancy in both M and N . The set B contains all those values of M N for which there is no redundancy in either M or N . Because A and B represent settings with maximum and minimum redundancy, essentially they are the basis for the DoF outer bounds and inner bounds, respectively. Take ( M, N ) = (35, 50) as an example. This channel lies in the range 2 3 ≤ M N ≤ 5 7 . Now, we know that the 35 × 50 setting has exactly 21 DoF. However, note that the 35 ×49 setting also has only 21 DoF. Incidentally, the 35 × 49 setting achieves the 21 DoF with only linear beamforming based interference alignment. Therefore, clearly, the 50 th receive antenna is redundant from a DoF perspective.\n2) The DoF Beneﬁt of MIMO Processing: In the K user MIMO IC with M = N , there is no DoF beneﬁt of joint processing among multiple antennas [2]. For the K-user M T × M R MIMO IC, Ghasemi et al. have shown in [4] that M\nand the achievability also does not need joint processing among multiple antennas. In this paper, we show that A contains the only M N values for which there is no DoF beneﬁt of joint processing among co-located antennas at the transmitters or receivers. Consider ( M, N ) = (3, 5) as an example. We show that each user has 2 DoF purely through linear alignment based on beamforming, which is strictly larger than MN M+N = 15 8\nreported in [4]. In fact, this may also be seen as a consequence of the maximum redundancy in the M/N ∈ A settings.\nIn this section, we show the information theoretic DoF outer bound proofs only for ( M, N ) = (2, 3) and (3, 4) cases, and shed light on the intuition behind the proofs.\nWe take invertible linear transformations at each transmitter and receiver, which do not affect the DoF of the channel. The detailed process, due to the space limitation, is omitted in this paper and presented in [1]. After the change of basis operation, we obtain the network with connectivity in Fig.3, where we only show the interference-carrying links. Since each receiver can decode its own message, it can subtract the signal caused by its own message from the received signal Y k(·) of each antenna, to obtain the interference S k(·) , as a function of corresponding transmit signals and noise.\nFirst, a genie provides G 1 = X n 2a to R 1 . Note that all the genie signal in this paper also includes noise. For brevity and also because we are interested only in DoF, we do not explicitly mention the noise term in the genie and received signals. Let us consider R 1 . Since we are dealing with a converse argument, it follows by assumption that the receiver is able to decode and subtract out its desired signal. It therefore has X n 2c at the antenna \u201c1 c\u201d. Thus, with G 1 , R 1 can decode W 2 from the observation ( X n 2a , S n 1c (X n 2c )) subject to the noise distortion 2 . After decoding W 2 it can reconstruct the transmitted signals ( X n 2a , X n 2c ) and subtract them from S n 1b to obtain S n 1b which is a linear combination of transmitted signals (X n 3a , X n 3c ). Now by the two linearly independent observations of ( S n 1a (X n 3a ), S n 1b (X n 3a , X n 3c )), R 1 can resolve ( X n 3a , X n 3c ) and thus can decode W 3 as well, subject to the noise distortion. Since the genie information G 1 provided to R 1 allows it to decode all three messages, we have:\nwhere (4) follows from Fano\u2019s inequality. (8) holds because knowing the message W 2 we can reconstruct the signal X n 2a . (9) follows from \u201cdropping the condition terms cannot decrease the differential entropy\u201d. Thus, we only keep S n 1c in the condition which is X n 2c . (10) is obtained because from the observations of ( X n 2a , X n 2c ) we can decode W 2 subject to the noise distortion. By advancing the user indices, we therefore obtain the following three inequalities:\nnR Σ ≤ Nn log ρ + nR k − h(X n kc ) + n o(log ρ) + o(n) (11) where k = 1, 2, 3. Since we always use \u201cadvance the user indices\u201d in a circularly symmetric way, from now on we will use compact notations R = R Σ /3 and h(X (·) ) = [h(X 1(·) ) + h(X 2(·) ) + h(X 3(·) )]/3, where quantities without user index represent the average of all rotated indices. Thus (11) can be rewritten as\nNext, consider a genie provides G 2 = X n 3c to R 1 . Similarly, with G 2 , R 1 can ﬁrst decode W 3 subject to the noise distortion from the observation ( S n 1a (X n 3a ), X n 3c ). After decoding W 3 , R 1\ncan reconstruct transmitted signals ( X n 3a , X n 3c ) and then sub- tract from S n 1b to obtain a linear combination of ( X n 2a , X n 2c ), from which combined with S n 1c (X n 2c ) R 1 can decode W 2 as well subject to the noise distortion. Since R 1 again can decode all three messages, we have the following inequality:\nThe derivation is similar to the ﬁrst inequality. By averaging over the user indices, we obtain the second inequality:\nBy dividing log ρ and n on both sides of (20), and letting ρ → ∞ and n → ∞, we obtain:\nSimilar to the previous example we have shown, we take invertible linear transformations introduced in [1] at each transmitter and receiver, and obtain the network with resulting connectivity shown in Fig.4.The embedded 2 × 3 network has the same connectivity as shown in the previous subsection.\nFirst, a genie provides the signal G 1 = (X n 2a 2 , X n 3c 2 , X n 2a 1 ) to R 1 . Let us consider the sum rate of three messages:\nwhere (22) follows from Fano\u2019s inequality. (28) is obtained because dropping condition terms does not decrease the dif- ferential entropy. Averaging over user indices produces:\nSecond, a genie provides G 2 = (X n 2a 2 ,X n 3c 2 ,X n 3c 1 ) to R 1 . With the similar analysis we have the inequality:\nThird, a genie provides signals G 3 = (X n 2a 2 , X n 2a 1 , X n 2c 1 ) to receiver 1. Thus, we have:\nSimilarly if a genie provides G 4 =(X n 3a 1 ,X n 3c 1 ,X n 3c 2 ) to R 1 , following the similar derivation of (32) we have:\nBy arranging terms of (34), dividing log ρ and n on both sides, and letting ρ → ∞ and n → ∞, we have:\nd ≤ 4N/9 = 20/9. \t (35) Remark 2: Consider the two examples we have shown.\nSuppose in Fig.4 a genie provides ( X n (k+1)a 2 , X n (k−1)c 2 ) to R k . Since X n (k+1)c 2 , X n (k−1)a 2 are already available at S n ka 2 , S n kc 2 and R k can reconstruct ( X n ka 2 , X n kc 2 ), it completely knows all signals from the outer shell antennas (denoted as a 2 , c 2 ) of each user. Intuitively if we remove the two outer shell antennas at each transmitter and receiver in the 4 × 5 setting, then the remaining core is the 2 × 3 setting.\nIn the abundance of linear beamforming schemes designed for MIMO IC, one of the central questions is the feasibility of linear interference alignment based on only spatial beamform- ing, i.e., without the need for channel extensions or variations in time/frequency. The feasibility problem was introduced by Gomadam, Cadambe and Jafar and they proposed iterative algorithms to test the feasibility of desired alignments. Recog- nizing the feasibility problem as equivalent to the solvability of a system of polynomial equations, Cenk et al. in [6] draw upon classical results in algebraic geometry about the solvability\nof generic polynomial equations, to classify an alignment problem as proper if and only if the number of independent variables in every set of equations is at least as large as the number of equations in that set. While the polynomial equations are not strictly generic, they appeal to the intuition that proper systems are likely to be feasible and improper systems to be infeasible. For a K user M T × M R MIMO IC where each user desires d DoF, Cenk et al. identiﬁed the system as proper if and only if d ≤ M T +M R K+1 . Recent works in [7], [8] show that linear interference alignment is indeed infeasible for improper systems. Also, they show that if M T = M R or if M T , M R are divisible by d, then proper systems are feasible. However, the feasibility of proper systems is in general not known, even for K = 3 users.\nOur results in [1] settle the question of feasibility of linear interference alignment for the 3 user M T × M R MIMO IC, for all values of M T , M R . Somewhat surprisingly within this setting, especially considering systems near the threshold of proper/improper distinction, we show that most proper systems are infeasible. Speciﬁcally, we show that the linear interference alignment problem ( M T × M R , d) 3 (as deﬁned in previous work by Cenk et al.) is feasible if and only if d ≤ DoF (M, N ) . For every value of γ = M/N , except for γ ∈ B = {1/3, 3/5, 5/7, · · · }, we show that there are proper systems that are not feasible (see the red solid boundary in Fig.2). As a related result, for every value of γ except γ ∈ B, there is redundancy either at the transmitter or receiver side, in the sense that some signal dimensions can be sacriﬁced without reducing the DoF value. Evidently this redundancy manifests itself as superﬂuous variables that are not discounted in the deﬁnition of proper systems, thus creating a discrepancy between proper and feasible systems.\nAcknowledgment: This work is supported in part by NSF CCF 1143982, NSF CCF 0830809 and by ONR N00014-12-"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
