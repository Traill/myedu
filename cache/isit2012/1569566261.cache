Upon arrival, customers are unaware of the current queue length at servers, so they sample a few servers and join the server with the shortest queue among the sampled few. Customers have time cost proportional to the waiting time at servers and sampling cost proportional to the number of sampled servers. Customers are self-interested and aim to minimize their own total cost by choosing the optimal number of servers to sample. Note that the waiting time of a customer depends on the other customers\u2019 choices, so it is a game among the customers and we call it the supermarket game, because often in supermarkets customers try to ﬁnd counters with short queue to check out.\nThe supermarket game is a simple model for analyzing dis- tributed load balancing in transportation and communication networks. Load balancing ensures efﬁcient resource utilization and improves the quality of service, by evenly distributing the workload across multiple servers. Traditionally, load balancing is fulﬁlled by a central dispatcher that assigns the newly arriving work to the server with the least workload. As modern or future networks become larger and increasingly distributed, such central dispatcher may not exist, and thus the load balancing has to be carried out by customers themselves. Hence, the supermarket game is relevant in scenarios where (1) customers choose which server to join without directions from\na central dispatcher or tracker; (2) global workload or queue length information is not available and customers randomly choose a ﬁnite number of servers to probe; (3) there is cost associated with probing a server and waiting in a queue.\n\u2022 Network routing: customers represent trafﬁc ﬂows and servers represent possible routes from a given source to a destination. A trafﬁc ﬂow can ﬁnd the route with low delay by probing different routes.\n\u2022 Dynamic wireless spectrum access: customers represent wireless devices and servers represent all the shared spectrum. The wireless devices can ﬁnd the spectrum band with low interference and congestion by probing multiple spectrum bands.\n\u2022 Cloud computing service: customers can decide how many servers to probe in seeking the server with low delay.\nIn this paper, we address the following natural questions for these systems: How many servers will a self-interested customer sample? Is sampling or probing more servers by some customers beneﬁcial or detrimental to the others?\nThe supermarket game with ﬁnite number of servers is difﬁcult to analyze due to the correlation among queues at different servers. Therefore, we study the supermarket game in a mean ﬁeld model that corresponds to the limit as the number of servers converges to inﬁnity. With unit exponential service rate at servers and Poisson arrival of customers, it is shown that:\n\u2022 There exists a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for all arrival rates per server less than one.\n\u2022 The action of sampling more servers by some customers has a positive externality on the other customers.\n\u2022 Nash equilibrium is unique for arrival rates per server less than or equal to 1/\ntonicity condition is satisﬁed. This condition is used to explore the uniqueness numerically for arrival rates per server larger than 1/\n\u2022 Multiple Nash equilibria exist for a particular example with arrival rates per server equal to 0.999.\nWe also show that the mean ﬁeld model arises naturally as the limit of supermarket game with ﬁnite number of servers:\n\u2022 The joint equilibrium distribution of any ﬁxed number of queues converges to a product distribution determined by the mean ﬁeld model as the number of queues converge to inﬁnity.\n\u2022 A Nash equilibrium of the supermarket game in the mean ﬁeld model is an ϵ-Nash equilibrium of the supermarket game for ﬁnite number of servers with the number of servers large enough.\nThe supermarket game is formulated based on the classical supermarket model with N parallel queues in which customers sample a ﬁxed number L of queues uniformly at random and join the shortest sampled queue. The supermarket model has been extensively studied in the literature [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] using the mean ﬁeld approach. The recent paper by Bramson et. al. [6] analyzes the supermarket model with general service time distributions. Ganesh et. al. [7] studies a variant of the supermarket model, where the customers initially join an arbitrary server, but may switch to other servers later independently at random.\nIn addition to the supermarket model, the mean ﬁeld ap- proach has also been used to analyze scheduling in queueing networks, such as the CSMA algorithm in a wireless local area network [8] and downlink transmission scheduling [9]. Also, a recent work [10] investigates the performance tradeoff between centralized and distributed scheduling in a multi- server system for the mean ﬁeld model. However, none of above work considers a game-theoretic framework.\nThe supermarket game proposed in this paper falls into a large research area involving equilibrium behavior of cus- tomers and servers, known as queueing games. A comprehen- sive survey can be found in [11]. A particularly relevant paper [12] studies a two line queueing system, where upon arrival each customer decides whether to purchase the information about which line is shorter, or randomly select one of the lines.\nFinally, the supermarket game is also related to and partially motivated by the theory of mean ﬁeld games in the context of dynamical games [13], [14]. The mean ﬁeld game approach studies a weakly coupled, N player game by letting N → ∞. However, we caution that in the supermarket game, we consider an inﬁnite sequence of customers instead of ﬁnitely many customers, which is different from an N player game.\nSection II introduces the precise deﬁnition of the super- market game to be studied and the key notations. The mean ﬁeld model for the supermarket game is studied in Section III, and justiﬁed in Section IV. Section V ends the paper with concluding remarks. Due to space limitations, some of the proofs are sketched, or omitted; they can be found in [15].\nConsider a supermarket game with N FCFS queues with exponential service rate one, and global Poisson arrival rate N λ. Assume λ < 1 and let L = {1, . . . , L max }. Upon arrival, each customer chooses a number L ∈ L of queues to be sampled uniformly at random, and the customer joins the\nsampled queue with the least number of customers, ties being resolved uniformly at random. Customers are assumed to have cost c per unit waiting time and c s for sampling one queue. These cost parameters are the same for all the customers.\nFor a ﬁxed customer i, if she chooses L i queues to sample, and all the other customers choose L −i , then by PASTA (Poisson arrival sees time average), the expected total cost of customer i is given by\nwhere E[W (L i , L −i )] is the expected waiting time (service time included) under the stationary distribution. The goal of customer i is to minimize her own expected total cost by choosing the optimal L i .\nSince the supermarket game is symmetric in the customers, we limit ourselves to symmetric strategies. We call L ⋆ ∈ L a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, if\nSince a pure strategy Nash equilibrium does not always exist, we are also interested in mixed strategy Nash equilibria.\nLet P(L) denote the set of all probability distributions over L. The mixed strategy µ i for customer i is simply a probability distribution in P(L), i.e., µ i (L i ) is the probability that customer i samples L i queues. If all the other customers use the mixed strategy µ −i , then the expected total cost of customer i using µ i is given by\nwhere C(L i , µ −i ) is the expected total cost of customer i choosing L i given all the others choose the mixed strategy\nDeﬁne the best response correspondence for customer i as BR(µ −i ) := arg min µ i C(µ i , µ −i ). The correspondence BR is a set-valued function from P(L) to subsets of P(L). We call µ ⋆ ∈ P(L) a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium if\nIn this paper, we are interested in characterizing the Nash equilibria of the supermarket game.\nLet L (X) denote the law of a random variable X. Weak convergence of probability measures is denoted by = ⇒. For µ 1 , µ 2 ∈ P(L), use µ 1 ≤ st µ 2 to denote that µ 1 is ﬁrst- order stochastically dominated by µ 2 , i.e.,\nµ 2 (j), ∀l ∈ L. For x ∈ R, let ⌊x⌋ denote the maximum integer no larger than x.\nThe supermarket game in a mean ﬁeld model is studied in this section by investigating the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\nIn this subsection, we derive an expression for the expected total cost incurred by a customer in a mean ﬁeld model, by assuming that queue lengths (including customers in service) are independent and identically distributed.\nSuppose all the customers except customer i use the mixed strategy µ −i , and let r t (k) denote the fraction of queues with at least k customers at time t in the mean ﬁeld model. Then, the mean ﬁeld equation is given by\nwhich is rigorously derived in [15]. For now, let us provide some intuition for each of the drift terms in (3):\nThe term λµ −i (l)(r l t (k − 1) − r l t (k)) corresponds to the ar- rivals of customers sampling l queues. Because queue lengths are i.i.d, r l t (k − 1) is the probability that the minimum queue length of l uniformly sampled queues is greater than or equal to k − 1. Thus, (r l t (k − 1) − r l t (k)) is the probability that the minimum queue length of l uniformly sampled queues is k −1, which is the same as the probability that a customer who samples l queues joins a queue with k − 1 customers. Note that r t (k) is increased if a customer joins a queue with k − 1 customers. Therefore, the ﬁrst term in (3) is the aggregate drift for r t (k) corresponding to arrivals.\nThe term (r t (k) − r t (k + 1)) corresponds to departures of customers at queues with exactly k customers.\nSince we are interested in the stationary regime, set dr t (k) dt = 0 to yield equations for the equilibrium distribution denoted by r µ −i (k), k ≥ 0. For k ≥ 1,\nwhere the random variable L is distributed as µ −i . By sum- ming the above equation for k 0 ≤ k < +∞ using telescoping sums and changing k 0 to k, it follows that\nBecause queues are independent in the mean ﬁeld model, E[W (L i , µ −i )] = 1 + E[N(L i )] = 1 + ∞ ∑\nwhere N (L i ) is the length of the shortest queue among the L i sampled queues. Therefore,\nSince g(L) = x L is convex in L ∈ R for x ≥ 0 and strictly convex for 0 < x < 1, it follows that E[W (L, µ −i )] and C(L, µ −i ) are strictly convex in L ∈ R.\nNext, we prove two key lemmas which are useful in the sequel.\nLemma 1. The best response set BR(µ −i ) consists of proba- bility measures concentrated on an integer or two consecutive integers.\nProof: Let µ ∈ BR(µ −i ). Suppose there exists L 1 < L 2 < L 3 ∈ L such that µ(L 1 ) > 0 and µ(L 3 ) > 0. Then, by the deﬁnition of BR,\nwhich contradicts the fact that C(L, µ −i ) is strictly convex in L and thus the conclusion follows.\nRemark 1. Lemma 1 implies that a probability measure µ ∈ BR(µ −i ) can be identiﬁed with a unique real number L ∈ [1, L max ]. A number L ∈ [1, L max ] with L = ⌊L⌋ + p for some 0 ≤ p < 1 is identiﬁed with the probability measure with mass 1 − p at ⌊L⌋ and p at ⌊L⌋ + 1. Thus, we use real numbers to refer to probability measures in BR(µ −i ).\nThe next lemma translates the stochastic dominance rela- tions between strategies into the stochastic dominance rela- tions between mean ﬁeld equilibrium distributions.\nLemma 2. Fix any µ 1 , µ 2 ∈ P(L) such that µ 1 ≤ st µ 2 . Then, for all k ∈ N, r µ 1 (k) ≥ r µ 2 (k). Furthermore, if µ 1 < st µ 2 , then for all k ≥ 2, r µ 1 (k) > r µ 2 (k). Also, it follows that for all k ∈ N and all µ ∈ P(L), r µ (k) ≤ λ k and C(L, µ) is bounded independently of L and µ.\nProof: Since µ 1 ≤ st µ 2 , it follows that for all x ∈ [0, 1], u µ 1 (x) ≥ u µ 2 (x). We prove the lemma by induction. If k = 0, then r µ 1 (0) = r µ 2 (0) = 1 and r µ 1 (0) ≥ r µ 2 (0) trivially holds. If r µ 1 (k − 1) ≥ r µ 2 (k − 1), then\nr µ 1 (k) = λu µ 1 [r µ 1 (k − 1)] ≥ λu µ 1 [r µ 2 (k − 1)] ≥ λu µ 2 [r µ 2 (k − 1)] = r µ 2 (k).\nTherefore, for all k ∈ N, r µ 1 (k) ≥ r µ 2 (k). Moreover, if µ 1 < st µ 2 , it follows that for all x ∈ (0, 1), u µ 1 (x) > u µ 2 (x). Thus, for all k ≥ 2, r µ 1 (k) > r µ 2 (k).\nLet µ 1 = δ 1 be a point measure at singleton 1. Then, r µ 1 (k) = λ k . Because for any µ ∈ P(L), δ 1 ≤ st µ, then r µ (k) ≤ λ k and C(L, µ) ≤ c/(1 − λ) + c s L max .\nIn this subsection, we show the existence of a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. It is easy to see that if there exists µ ⋆ such that µ ⋆ ∈ BR(µ ⋆ ), i.e., µ ⋆ is a ﬁxed point of the best response correspondence, then µ ⋆ is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Thus, it sufﬁces to show the existence of such a ﬁxed point. The Kakutani ﬁxed point theorem is used to prove it [15].\nTheorem 1. The supermarket game has a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in the mean ﬁeld model.\nFor customer i, her marginal value of sampling at an integer L i with all the others adopting µ −i , is deﬁned as\nIntuitively, V (L i , µ −i ) characterizes the reduction of expected waiting time when customer i increases the number of sampled queues from L i to L i + 1. For ease of notation, deﬁne V (0, µ i ) = ∞ and V (L max , µ i ) = 0. Since E[W (L, µ −i )] is strictly convex in L ∈ R, V (L i , µ −i ) is strictly decreasing in L i . The following lemma characterizes the best response using V (L i , µ −i ).\nLemma 3. Fix any µ −i ∈ P(L) and any integer L i ∈ L. Then L i ∈ BR(µ −i ) if and only if\nFurthermore, ﬁx any non-integer L i ∈ [1, L max ]. Then L i ∈ BR(µ −i ) if and only if\nThe next lemma proves a global monotonicity property of V (L i , µ −i ) in case λ 2 ≤ 1/2, which is useful for showing the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium in that case.\nLemma 4. Assume λ 2 ≤ 1/2 and ﬁx any µ −i , ˜ µ −i ∈ P(L) such that µ −i < st ˜ µ −i . Then V (L i , µ −i ) > V (L i , ˜ µ −i ) for 1 ≤ L i ≤ L max − 1. Furthermore, let L i ∈ BR(µ −i ) and ˜ L i ∈ BR(˜µ −i ), then ˜ L i ≤ L i .\nProof: In order to show that V (L i , µ −i ) > V (L i , ˜ µ −i ), we prove a stronger conclusion, that is, for k ≥ 2,\nDeﬁne function g(x) = x L i − x L i +1 . The derivative g \u2032 (x) = x L i −1 (L i − (L i + 1)x). Hence, for x < 1 2 , g \u2032 (x) > 0. Therefore, g(r µ −i (k)) > g(r ˜ µ −i (k)), ∀k ≥ 2, and thus equation (8) holds.\nSince V (L i , µ −i ) > V (L i , ˜ µ −i ), it is not hard to derive that ˜ L i ≤ L i using Lemma 3 [15].\nLemma 4 implies that for λ 2 ≤ 1/2, a customer tends to sample fewer queues when all the other customers sample more queues. This is an instance of avoid the crowd behavior [11], leading to uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium.\nTheorem 2. If λ 2 ≤ 1 2 , the supermarket game has a unique Nash equilibrium in the mean ﬁeld model.\nProof: A Nash equilibrium exists by Theorem 1. Let L ⋆ , ˜ L ⋆ ∈ [1, L max ] denote two possible Nash equilibria; we show that L ⋆ = ˜ L ⋆ .\nWithout loss of generality, suppose L ⋆ < ˜ L ⋆ ; by Lemma 4, L ⋆ ≥ ˜L ⋆ , which is a contradiction and concludes the proof.\nHowever, the marginal value of sampling V (L i , L −i ) is not always decreasing in L −i ∈ [1, L max ] (L −i refers to a probability distribution here) for all λ < 1. By numerical results, we ﬁnd that when λ = 0.99 and L i = 5, V (L i , L −i ) is increasing with L −i for 11 ≤ L −i ≤ 16. This implies that\nsometimes a customer tends to sample more queues when all the others sample more queues. This follow the crowd behavior can lead to multiple Nash equilibria. Such a scenario is described in the sequel.\nNext, we introduce a local monotonicity condition and show the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for all values of c and c s if and only if the local monotonicity condition is satisﬁed.\nDeﬁnition 1. Given 0 < λ < 1 and any integer L max ≥ 1, the local monotonicity condition is satisﬁed for (λ, L max ) if V (L, L + q) is strictly decreasing over 0 ≤ q ≤ 1 for each integer L with 1 ≤ L ≤ L max − 1.\nTheorem 3. Given 0 < λ < 1 and any integer L max ≥ 1, the supermarket game in the mean ﬁeld model has a unique Nash equilibrium for all values of c and c s , if and only if the local monotonicity condition is satisﬁed for (λ, L max ).\nNumerical results show that when λ = 0.99, V (L, L + q) is indeed strictly decreasing with respect to 0 ≤ q ≤ 1 for L = 1, . . . , 9. For L ≥ 10,\nwhich implies that V (L, L + q) is strictly decreasing over 0 ≤ q ≤ 1, in view of the proof for Lemma 4. Therefore, for λ = 0.99 and any integer L max ≥ 1, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium for all values of c and c s . However, through numerical experiments, we ﬁnd that when λ = 0.999 and L max = 25, V (L, L + q) is strictly increasing in q for L = 18, . . . , 24. Therefore, multiple Nash equilibria exist if c s /c = 0.0148. In particular, L = 19, . . . , 24 are pure strategy Nash equilibria and mixed strategy Nash equilibria exist between each two consecutive pure strategy Nash equilibria.\nThe action of sampling more queues by some customers has an effect on the waiting time of others. This effect is called the externality associated with the action and the externality is positive if the action reduces the mean waiting time of the other customers. In this subsection, the externality in the mean ﬁeld model is analyzed. It is not clear whether the externality is positive at ﬁrst sight. On one hand, choosing a large number of queues to sample helps a customer ﬁnd a less loaded queue and hence reduces future arrivals\u2019 opportunity to ﬁnd lightly loaded queues. On the other hand, it also leads to a well balanced system and reduces the average waiting time.\nThe following corollary of Lemma 2 implies that the action of sampling more queues by some customers has a positive externality on the other customers in the mean ﬁeld model. To see it, suppose in system 1, all the customers adopt a strategy µ 1 ; while in system 2, a fraction 0 < p ≤ 1 of them samples more queues, i.e., adopts a new strategy µ 3 with µ 1 < st µ 3 and all the others still adopt the strategy µ 1 . For system 2, it is equivalent to assume that all the customers adopt a strategy µ 2 with µ 2 = pµ 3 + (1 − p)µ 1 . It follows that µ 1 < st µ 2 . By Corollary 1, system 2 has smaller mean waiting time.\nCorollary 1. If µ 1 , µ 2 ∈ P(L) with µ 1 < st µ 2 , then for all L ∈ L, E[W (L, µ 1 )] > E[W (L, µ 2 )].\nProof: Because µ 1 < st µ 2 , by Lemma 2, r µ 1 (k) > r µ 2 (k), ∀k ≥ 2. Hence, the conclusion follows by invoking the deﬁnition of E[W (L, µ)].\nRemark 2. Corollary 1 further implies that customers sample no more queues for any Nash equilibrium than for the socially optimal strategy. See [15] for the details.\nIn this section, we justify the mean ﬁeld model as the limit of the supermarket game with ﬁnite N as N → ∞. Let W (N ) (µ i , µ −i ) and C (N ) (µ i , µ −i ) denote customer i\u2019s waiting time and total average cost for N queues. Then, the expected waiting time can be derived as\nwhere Q (N ) (i) is the length of the ith sampled queue in equilibrium.\nThe following theorem shows that the mean ﬁeld model corresponds to the limit as N → ∞.\nTheorem 4. Let Z denote the random variable associated with the mean ﬁeld equilibrium distribution r µ −i (k), then for any ﬁxed integer L i ≥ 1, as N → ∞,\nRemark 3. The proof of Theorem 4 is based on the idea of propagation of chaos [16], [3]. See [15] for the full proof.\nNext, the deﬁnition of ϵ-Nash equilibrium in the ﬁnite N model is introduced.\nDeﬁnition 2. We call µ ⋆ ∈ P(L) an ϵ-Nash equilibrium for a ﬁnite N , if for any ϵ > 0,\nTheorem 5. Let µ ⋆ be a Nash equilibrium for the supermarket game in the mean ﬁeld model, then µ ⋆ is an ϵ-Nash equilibrium in the ﬁnite N model for N sufﬁciently large.\nProof: By the coupling result given in [15], [2], it follows that W (N ) (L i , µ −i ) is uniformly integrable. In view of Theorem 4, it follows that for each ϵ > 0, there exists N 0 ∈ N such that when N ≥ N 0 ,\nwhere W (L i , µ −i ) and C(µ, µ −i ) are the waiting time and total average cost respectively in the mean ﬁeld model. Then using the deﬁnition of µ ⋆ , the conclusion follows easily.\nOur results indicate that the equilibrium picture for the supermarket game can be somewhat complicated, at least if 0.5 < λ 2 < 1. In particular, there may be multiple Nash equilibria, stemming from the fact that customers do not always have an \u201cavoid the crowd\u201d response as when λ 2 ≤ 0.5. However, this complication seems to occur only for λ close to one and L max fairly large. Also, at least in the mean ﬁeld limit model, the positive externality of increased sampling holds for the whole range λ < 1. For the ﬁnite N model, the coupling result in [2] shows that sampling more queues by some customers has a positive externality on customers who only sample one queue. However, for customers who sample more than one queue, the samplings of more queues by other customers can have a negative externality [15]."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"N. D.
