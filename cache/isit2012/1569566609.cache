The state-of-the-art interference management techniques, such as interference alignment, require the avail- ability of perfect and instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at all transmitting nodes (full CSIT assumption) [1], [2]. However, the feasibility of this assumption is questionable if the CSI varies very fast over a block of channel uses. This is the case in high mobility environments where the CSI obtained from the receivers through feedback links expires before being exploited by the transmitters for the current transmission.\nNonetheless, a surprising result by Maddah-Ali and Tse [3] showed that even in an i.i.d. fading environment, having a completely outdated CSI at transmitters (delayed CSIT) can signiﬁcantly improve the achievable rates compared to having no CSIT at all. Focusing on multiple-input single- output (MISO) broadcast channels, they showed that this improvement is even multiplicative, i.e., one can achieve higher than only one degrees of freedom (DoF) which can be achieved with no CSIT. The delayed CSIT model was then studied for two-user and three-user MIMO broadcast channels in [4], [5].\nIn another research direction, the impact of delayed CSIT on the DoF of channels with distributed transmitters have been ﬁrst studied in [6], where the authors obtained achievable DoFs greater than 1 for two-user single-input single-output (SISO) X channel and three-user SISO interference channel (IC). The challenge in these channels is that, in contrast to the broadcast channel, each transmitter has only access to its\nown messages. Strictly higher achievable DoFs of 6/5 and 36/31 were then reported for these two channels respectively in [7] and [8]. The DoF region of the two-user MIMO IC with delayed CSIT was investigated in [9], [10]. Except for the two-user MIMO IC whose DoF region with delayed CSIT has been fully characterized, the DoF region or sum-DoF of X channel with any number of users and interference channel with more than two users are still unknown due to lack of tight upper bounds. The best available achievable results on the DoF of the general K-user SISO IC and X channel with delayed CSIT can be found in [8].\nIn this paper, we investigate the two-user MIMO X channel with delayed CSIT and with the same number of M antennas at each transmitter and N antennas at each receiver. We propose transmission schemes that achieve strictly higher sum- DoF than one can achieve under the no CSIT assumption for 2M > N . We further show that our achievable DoF is tight for all values of M and N except possibly for 1/2 < N/M < 4/3 by using the broadcast channel upper-bound developed in [3] and [4].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: The system model is introduced in Section II. The main results are pre- sented and discussed in Section III. The proof of the achievable result is provided in Section IV. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section V.\nAn (M, N ) MIMO X channel, as depicted in Fig. 1, is described by the following input-output relationship:\nwhere j ∈ {1, 2} is the receiver index, t, t = 1, 2, · · · , is the time index, X [i] (t) ∈ C M is the transmitted vector of TX i , Y [j] (t) ∈ C N is the received vector at RX j , H [ji] (t) ∈ C N ×M is the channel matrix between TX i and RX j , and Z [j] (t) ∈ C N is the complex Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) vector at RX j . The transmitters are required to satisfy the same power constraint\nWe further assume that the channel coefﬁcients are i.i.d. standard complex Gaussian random variables across time and space and are independent of the receiver noise.\nIn the X channel, there are four independent messages: W 11 , W 12 , W 21 , W 22 , where W ij denotes a message from TX i to RX j . A rate tuple (R 11 (P ), R 12 (P ), R 21 (P ), R 22 (P )) is said to be achievable for the MIMO X channel if the cardinality of each message set W ij , i, j ∈ {1, 2}, can be increased as 2 nR ij (P ) with block length n and the average probability of error for all messages can be made arbitrar- ily small when n is sufﬁciently large. The capacity region C X (P ) of the MIMO X channel is the set of all achievable rate tuples (R 11 (P ), R 12 (P ), R 21 (P ), R 22 (P )). A DoF tuple (d 11 , d 12 , d 21 , d 22 ) is said to be achievable if there exists a rate tuple (R 11 (P ), R 12 (P ), R 21 (P ), R 22 (P )) ∈ C X (P ) such that\n, i, j ∈ {1, 2}. The DoF region D X of the MIMO X channel is the set of all achievable DoF tuples (d 11 , d 12 , d 21 , d 22 ). The sum-DoF of this channel is deﬁned as:\nIt is assumed that each receiver has access to its own channel matrices perfectly and instantaneously while hav- ing other channel matrices with a unit delay. Moreover, each transmitter knows all channel matrices perfectly but with a unit delay. More precisely, at time index t, RX j , j ∈ {1, 2}, has access to {H [j1] (t ), H [j2] (t )} t t =1 and {H [¯ j1] (t ), H [¯ j2] (t )} t−1 t =1 , ¯ j = {1, 2}\\j, and TX i has access to {H(t )} t−1 t =1 {H [11] (t ), H [12] (t ), H [21] (t ), H [22] (t )} t−1 t =1 . The aforementioned assumptions about the CSI knowledge of the transmitters and receivers will be referred to as delayed CSIT . In the following, the sum-DoF of the MIMO X channel with delayed CSIT will be denoted by DoF d-CSI X . Also, the sum- DoF of this channel with full and no CSIT will be denoted by DoF f-CSI X and DoF n-CSI X , respectively.\nThe following theorem is our main result on the sum-DoF of the (M, N ) MIMO X channel with delayed CSIT:\n         \n        \n(4) Furthermore, the above lower bound is tight for all cases except possibly for 1 2 < N M < 4 3 .\nThe proof of achievability is presented in section IV. The converse proof is provided in the discussion.\nFrom [1] and [11], the sum-DoF of the MIMO X channel with full CSIT is given by:\nOn the other hand, it was shown in [12] that with no CSIT, the sum-DoF of this channel collapses to:\nIf we allow the transmitters in the MIMO X channel to cooperate, we reach to a MIMO broadcast channel with 2M antennas at the transmitter and N antennas at each receiver whose DoF region with delayed CSIT was characterized in [4] as:\nSince cooperation cannot shrink the capacity region, the above DoF region can serve as an outer-bound for the DoF region of the MIMO X channel with delayed CSIT by just replacing d 1 by d 11 + d 12 and replacing d 2 by d 21 + d 22 . From (7) and (8), one can obtain the sum-DoF of the MIMO BC channel with delayed CSIT which is an upper-bound for the sum-DoF of the MIMO X channel:\nmin(2M, N ) + 2 min(M, N ) . (9) Our achievable DoF results for the MIMO X channel with\ndelayed CSIT are summarized in Table I along with the channel DoFs with full and no CSIT and also the broadcast upper-bound (9). From the table, one can make the following observations:\n\u2022 For N M < 2, delayed CSIT improves the channel sum- DoF compared to the no CSIT case.\n\u2022 For N M ≤ 1 2 or N M ≥ 4 3 , our achievable sum-DoF is tight and characterize the channel sum-DoF. It is interesting to note that the channel sum-DoF under the delayed CSIT assumption lies strictly between channel sum-DoF with full CSIT and channel sum-DoF with no CSIT. Also, for these cases the sum-DoF of the X channel with delayed CSIT coincides with sum-DoF of the BC obtained by allowing cooperation between transmitters.\n\u2022 When M = N , our achievable DoF is equal to 6 5 N which has been previously reported in [7].\nIn an independent work, the DoF of the MIMO X channel with feedback and delayed CSIT has been characterized in [13] . Comparing their results with Theorem 1 reveals that in the presence of delayed CSIT, feedback can only increase DoF for 1 2 < N M < 4 3 . We do not know at this stage whether the gap between the achieved DoF and the outer bound is due to the weakness of the coding scheme or a new outer bound is expected.\nThe common ingredient of our achievable scheme is to re- construct the interfering signals of each receiver at transmitters based on delayed CSIT, and re-transmit them. Retransmission of interfering signals for both receivers can be done simulta- neously, in order to achieve a higher DoF. We consider each of the ﬁve cases in Theorem 1 separately:\nIn this case, the channel DoFs with full and no CSIT coincide and are equal to 2M . Therefore, the channel DoF with delayed CSIT is also equal to 2M .\nOur transmission scheme consists of three phases: Phase I is dedicated to RX 1 , i.e., in this phase, each transmitter sends some information symbols desired by RX 1 . In Phase II, which is assigned to RX 2 , each transmitter sends some information symbols for RX 2 . Finally, in Phase III, each transmitter sends some redundant information to help both receivers to resolve their desired symbols. In the following, we assume that a\nvariables are desired by RX 1 and b variables are desired by RX 2 . The details of our transmission scheme are as follows:\nPhase I: This phase takes one channel use in which each of TX 1 and TX 2 sends M independent information symbols for RX 1 . Let a [k] 1 , · · · , a [k] M , k ∈ {1, 2}, denote the transmitted symbols of TX k during Phase I. By the end of this phase, RX 1 has N equations in terms of 2M desired unknowns. Since 2M > N , RX 1 needs 2M − N extra equations to be able to resolve its desired information symbols. Now, let us look at the second receiver: RX 2 has also N equations which contain no information for RX 2 , but, they can serve as the extra equations RX 1 needs in order to resolve its intended symbols. Each of these N equations, however, is a linear combination of information symbols of both transmitters, and therefore, can not be locally generated at one transmitter. To overcome this bottleneck, RX 2 eliminates M variables a [2] 1 , · · · , a [2] M from its received equations ∗ to obtain N − M linearly independent equations which are solely in terms of a [1] 1 , · · · , a [1] M . Let J [2] 1 , · · · , J [2] N −M denote these equations. RX 2 can also elimi- nate M variables a [1] 1 , · · · , a [1] M to obtain N − M linearly inde- pendent equations which are solely in terms of a [2] 1 , · · · , a [2] M . These equations are denoted by V [2] 1 , · · · , V [2] N −M . Therefore, from the N received equations at RX 2 , 2(N − M ) equations are formed \u2020 which are solely in terms of information symbols of one transmitter. According to the delayed CSIT assumption, TX 1 has access to J [2] 1 , · · · , J [2] N −M at the end of Phase I. Similarly, TX 2 has access to V [2] 1 , · · · , V [2] N −M at the end of Phase I. Since 2(N − M ) ≥ 2M − N , if we somehow deliver any 2M − N of J [2] 1 , · · · , J [2] N −M , V [2] 1 , · · · , V [2] N −M to RX 1 ,\nit has enough equations to resolve its desired information symbols. This goal will be achieved in Phase III.\nPhase II: This phase is similar to Phase I by exchang- ing the role of receivers. During this phase, each of TX 1 and TX 2 sends M information symbols for RX 2 . Let b [1] 1 , · · · , b [1] M denote the information symbols transmitted by TX 1 and b [2] 1 , · · · , b [2] M denote the information symbols trans- mitted by TX 2 . RX 1 can eliminate the variables b [1] 1 , · · · , b [1] M from its received equations to obtain N − M equations V [1] 1 , · · · , V [1] N −M which are solely in terms of b [2] 1 , · · · , b [2] M . RX 1 can also eliminate the variables b [2] 1 , · · · , b [2] M from its received equations to obtain N −M equations J [1] 1 , · · · , J [1] N −M which are solely in terms of b [1] 1 , · · · , b [1] M . Since 2(N − M ) ≥ 2M − N , if we somehow deliver any 2M − N of J [1] 1 , · · · , J [1] N −M , V [1] 1 , · · · , V [1] N −M to RX 2 , it has enough equations to resolve its desired information symbols. This goal will be achieved in Phase III.\nPhase III: The linear combination J [1] 1 + J [2] 1 is solely in terms of information symbols of TX 1 and the channel coefﬁcients in the ﬁrst and second channel uses. Therefore,\naccording to the delayed CSIT assumption, it is available at TX 1 at the and of Phase II. Moreover, since J [1] 1 is available at RX 1 , if we deliver J [1] 1 + J [2] 1 to RX 1 , it can eliminate the effect of J [1] 1 to obtain J [2] 1 which is a useful equation in terms of information symbols desired by RX 1 . Similarly, by delivering J [1] 1 + J [2] 1 to RX 2 , it can eliminate the effect of J [2] 1 to obtain J [1] 1 which is a useful equation in terms of information symbols desired by RX 2 . Therefore, J [1] 1 + J [2] 1\nis a useful equation for both receivers. Since each receiver only needs 2M − N extra equations to resolve its desired symbols, our goal in Phase III is to deliver the 2M − N linear combinations J [1] 1 + J [2] 1 , · · · , J [1] N −M + J [2] N −M , V [1] 1 + V [2] 1 , · · · , V [1] 3M −2N + V [2] 3M −2N to both receivers. Since there are N antennas at each receiver and N < 2M , this can be simply accomplished in 2M −N N channel uses § .\nSince 2(M + M ) = 4M information symbols were trans- mitted in 1 + 1 + 2M −N N = 2M +N N channel uses, we have achieved a DoF of 4M N 2M +N .\nOur transmission scheme for this case consists of three phases as follows:\nPhase I: This phase takes two channel uses. At each channel use, TX 1 sends M independent information symbols for RX 1 . Let a [1] 1 , · · · , a [1] 2M denote the transmitted symbols of TX 1 during Phase I. TX 2 sends 3N − 2M information symbols intended for RX 1 in this phase by transmitting random linear combinations of these symbols over its transmit antennas. Notice that since 1 < N M < 4 3 we have 0 < 3N − 2M < 2M . Let a [2] 1 , · · · , a [2] 3N −2M denote the transmitted symbols of TX 2 during Phase I. By the end of Phase I, RX 2 has 2N equations in terms of 2M + 3N − 2M = 3N unknowns. From this system of equations, RX 2 can eliminate 3N − 2M variables a [2] 1 , · · · , a [2] 3N −2M to obtain 2N − (3N − 2M ) = 2M − N independent equations which are solely in terms of a [1] 1 , · · · , a [1] 2M . Let J [2] 1 , · · · , J [2] 2M −N denote these equations. RX 2 can also eliminate 2M variables a [1] 1 , · · · , a [1] 2M to obtain 2N − 2M = 2(N − M ) independent equations which are solely in terms of a [2] 1 , · · · , a [2] 3N −2M . Let V [2] 1 , · · · , V [2] 2(N −M ) denote these equations. Thus, from the 2N received equations at RX 2 during Phase I, 2M − N + 2(N − M ) = N independent equations are formed which are solely in terms of information symbols of one transmitter. Since RX 1 needs 3N − 2N = N extra equations to resolve its received symbols during Phase I, we should deliver all the linear combinations J [2] 1 , · · · , J [2] 2M −N , V [2] 1 , · · · , V [2] 2(N −M ) to RX 1 . This goal is accomplished in Phase III.\nPhase II: This phase takes two channel uses. At each chan- nel use, TX 1 sends M independent information symbols for RX 2 . Let b [1] 1 , · · · , b [1] 2M denote the transmitted symbols of TX 1 during Phase II. TX 2 sends 3N − 2M information symbols\nintended for RX 2 in this phase by transmitting random linear combinations of these symbols over its transmit antennas. Let b [2] 1 , · · · , b [2] 3N −2M denote the transmitted symbols of TX 2 dur- ing Phase II. From its received equations during Phase II, RX 1 can eliminate 3N − 2M variables b [2] 1 , · · · , b [2] 3N −2M to obtain 2M − N equations which are solely in terms of b [1] 1 , · · · , b [1] 2M . Let J [1] 1 , · · · , J [1] 2M −N denote these equations. RX 1 can also eliminate 2M variables b [1] 1 , · · · , b [1] 2M to obtain 2(N − M ) equations which are solely in terms of b [2] 1 , · · · , b [2] 3N −2M . Let V [1] 1 , · · · , V [1] 2(N −M ) denote these equations. RX 2 requires all the linear combinations J [1] 1 , · · · , J [1] 2M −N , V [1] 1 , · · · , V [1] 2(N −M ) to resolve its desired symbols. This goal is achieved in Phase III.\nPhase III: The linear combination J [1] 1 + J [2] 1 is solely in terms of information symbols of TX 1 and the channel coefﬁcients in the ﬁrst and second channel uses. Therefore, according to the delayed CSIT assumption, it is available at TX 1 at the and of Phase II. Moreover, if we deliver J [1] 1 + J [2] 1 to both receivers, each of them will obtain a useful equation in terms of its desired information symbols. Since each receiver needs N extra equations to resolve its desired symbols, our goal in Phase III is to deliver the N linear\n· · · , V [1] 2(N −M ) +V [2] 2(N −M ) to both receivers. This can be simply accomplished in one channel use § .\nSince 6N information symbols were transmitted in 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 channel uses, we have achieved a DoF of\nOur transmission scheme consists of three phases as fol- lows:\nPhase I: This phase takes two channel uses. At each channel use, TX 1 sends M independent information symbols for RX 1 . Let a [1] 1 , · · · , a [1] 2M denote the transmitted symbols of TX 1 during Phase I. TX 2 sends 2N − M information symbols intended for RX 1 in the ﬁrst channel use and retransmits them in the second channel use. Notice that since 1 2 < N M < 1 we have 0 < 2N − M < M . Let a [2] 1 , · · · , a [2] 2N −M denote the transmitted symbols of TX 2 during Phase I. By the end of Phase I, RX 2 has 2N equations in terms of 2M + 2N − M = M + 2N unknowns. From this system of equations, RX 2 can eliminate 2N − M variables a [2] 1 , · · · , a [2] 2N −M to obtain M equations which are solely in terms of a [1] 1 , · · · , a [1] 2M . Let J [2] 1 , · · · , J [2] M denote these equations. Note that the linear combinations J [2] 1 , · · · , J [2] M are in terms of symbols of TX 1 and according to the delayed CSIT assumption, TX 1 has access to these linear combinations at the end of Phase I. If we somehow deliver J [2] 1 , · · · , J [2] M to RX 1 , it will have enough equations to resolve its desired information symbols. This goal will be achieved at Phase III.\nPhase II: This phase is similar to Phase I by exchanging the role of receivers. By the end of this phase, TX 1 and TX 2 have respectively sent 2N − M and 2M fresh information symbols intended for RX 2 . Let b [1] 1 , · · · , b [1] 2N −M denote the information symbols transmitted by TX 1 and b [2] 1 , · · · , b [2] 2M denote the information symbols transmitted by TX 2 . Similar to Phase I, RX 1 can eliminate the variables b [1] 1 , · · · , b [1] 2N −M from the 2N equations available at this receiver to obtain M equations in terms of b [2] 1 , · · · , b [2] 2M . Let V [1] 1 , · · · , V [1] M denote these equations. Similar to Phase I, TX 2 has access to these linear combinations at the end of Phase II. If we somehow deliver V [1] 1 , · · · , V [1] M to RX 2 , it will have enough equations to resolve its desired information symbols. This goal will be achieved at Phase III.\nPhase III: Our objective in this phase is to deliver J [2] 1 , · · · , J [2] M to RX 1 and deliver V [1] 1 , · · · , V [1] M to RX 2 . Since V [2] 1 , · · · , V [2] M are available at both TX 1 and RX 2 and since J [1] 1 , · · · , J [1] M are available at both TX 2 and RX 1 , Phase III will be accomplished in M N channel uses \u2020 .\nSince 2(2N + M ) information symbols were transmitted in 2 + 2 + M N = 4N +M N channel uses, we have achieved a DoF of 2N M +4N (M + 2N ).\nSince the MIMO interference channel is contained in the MIMO X channel and the sum-DoF of the two-user MIMO IC with M ≥ 2N is equal to 4 3 N (see [9] or [10]), we can conclude that 4 3 N is also an achievable DoF for the MIMO X channel.\nWe obtained new results on the sum-DoF of the (M, N ) MIMO X channel with delayed CSIT. By developing new coding schemes, we showed that there exist antenna conﬁg- urations such that under the delayed CSIT assumption, the sum-DoF of the MIMO X channel is equal to the sum-DoF of the two-user MIMO BC which is obtained by allowing cooperation between the two transmitters. We also proved that, our achievable results are tight for all antenna conﬁgurations except for the case of 1 2 < N M < 4 3 ."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M. A. Maddah-Ali"},{"name":"S. A.
