Simple and intuitive as it appears, the conjecture has remained open since its proposal in 2004 [1], [2], and is now a well-known unsolved problem in the ﬁeld of network coding. In this work, we provide a proof to the conjecture in its space/geometric version. Space information ﬂow is a new paradigm being proposed [3], [4]. It studies the transmission of information in a geometric space, where information ﬂows are free to propagate along any trajectories, and may be encoded wherever they meet. The goal is to minimize a natural bandwidth-distance sum-product (network volume), while sustaining end-to-end unicast and multicast communication demands among terminals at known coordinates. The conjecture is true in networks only if it is true in space. Our main result is that network coding is indeed equivalent to routing in the space model. Besides its own merit, this partially veriﬁes the original conjecture, and further leads to a geometric framework [5] for a hopeful proof to the conjecture."},"body":{"text":"Departing from the classic store-and-forward principle of data networking, network coding encourages information ﬂows to be \u201cmixed\u201d in the middle of a network, via means of coding [6], [7]. While network coding for a single communication session (unicast, broadcast or multicast) is well understood by now, the case of multiple independent sessions (multi-source, multi-sink) is much harder, with less results known [8]. A basic scenario in the latter is the multiple unicast setting, where multiple independent one-to-one communication demands co- exist in a network. With routing, the optimal solution can be computed by solving a multicommodity ﬂow (MCF) linear program; with network coding, the structure and the computa- tional complexity of the optimal solution are largely unknown.\nIn directed networks, network coding can augment the capacity region of multiple unicast. For example, Fig. 1(A) shows a network coding solution for two unicast sessions in a directed network, where each session has a throughput of 1. Without network coding, it is not hard to verify that achieving a throughput of 1 and 1 for both sessions concurrently is infeasible, given the pre-deﬁned link directions. In general, the coding advantage, the ratio of the maximum throughput\nachievable with network coding over that with routing, may grow linearly with the network size [9].\nHowever, no >1 coding advantage has been observed for multiple unicast in the undirected setting. For example, Fig. 1(B) shows a MCF with end-to-end ﬂow rate of 1 for each of the two unicast sessions. Li and Li [1] and Harvey et al. [2] conjectured that network coding is equivalent to routing for multiple unicast in undirected networks.\nDespite a series of research effort devoted [10]\u2013[12], rather limited progresses have been made towards settling this fun- damental problem in network coding. Besides \u201ceasy\u201d cases where the cut set bounds can be achieved without network coding [1], [2], the conjecture has been veriﬁed only in small, ﬁxed networks and their variations, such as the Okamura- Seymour network [10], [11]. It is worth noting that such veriﬁcation already involves new tools in network informa- tion theory such as information dominance [10], input-output equality and crypto equality [11]. A growing agreement is that new tools beyond a \u201csimple blend\u201d of graph theory and information theory are required for eventually settling the conjecture. In this work, we prove the geometric version of the multiple unicast conjecture, by further incorporating mature techniques in geometry into the picture.\nIn 2007, Mitzenmacher et al. compiled a list of seven open problems in network coding [13], where the multiple unicast conjecture appears as problem number 1. Chekuri commented that claiming an equivalence between network coding and routing for all undirected networks is a \u201cbold conjecture\u201d, and that the problem of fully understanding network coding for multiple unicast sessions is still \u201cwild open\u201d ( [14], p51-55).\nSpace information ﬂow is a new subject of study being proposed [3], [4]. It considers terminals at known locations in a geometric space, with unicast, broadcast or multicast communication demands among them. Information ﬂows can be transmitted along any trajectories in the space, and may be replicated wherever desired, or encoded wherever they meet. The goal is to minimize the total bandwidth-distance sum- product, while sustaining given end-to-end communication rates. Besides being a conceivable theoretical problem of \u201cnetwork coding in space\u201d, space information ﬂow models the min-cost design of a blueprint of a communication network, which deserves renewed research attention given network coding [3]. As we will discuss later, space information ﬂow also opens the door to geometric approaches for studying network information ﬂow problems, including in particular the multiple unicast network coding conjecture in graphs.\nFor a quick feel of space information ﬂow, consider three unicast sessions each with unit demand, from s 1 to t 1 , from s 2 to t 2 and from s 3 to t 3 , respectively, in a 2-D Euclidean space as shown in Fig.1. We can route an information ﬂow along any path in space, insert relay nodes wherever desired, and replicate or encode information ﬂows wherever desired. We aim to minimize the volume of the solution network induced,\n||e||f(e). Here e is a link employed for ﬂow transmission, ||e|| is the length of e in space, and f(e) is the rate of information ﬂow routed across e. What is the optimal solution for satisfying the three unicast demands? Can network coding lead to better solutions than routing (MCF)? Recent examples show that network coding can outperform routing when the demand in space is multicast [3], [4]. What about multiple unicast?\nOur main result in this work is that network coding is equivalent to routing, for multiple unicast in the new space information ﬂow model. We restrict our attention to Eu- clidean spaces; the case of non-Euclidean spaces, such as n- dimensional spaces under Chebyshev distance, is still being investigated [5].\nWe ﬁrst analyze the simple case of a 1-D space, where a single point constitutes a cut. A natural requirement on a valid\nmultiple unicast solution here is that, at any given point A, the total amount of ﬂows at A, aggregated from both directions, should be at least the total demand of unicast sessions whose terminals reside on different sides of A. We take integration on both sides of this inequality along all points in the 1-D space, and prove that network coding can not improve upon an optimal solution based on routing (MCF).\nFor the general case of a h-D space, h ≥ 2, our approach is to reduce the problem into 1-D, by applying the mature tool of projection in geometry. We prove that, if network coding can outperform MCF in h-D, then it can do so in 1-D, thereby leading to a contradiction. More speciﬁcally, we show that in a given case where a network coding based solution has a smaller cost than that of MCF, there must exist a 1-D subspace, onto which the projection of the network coding solution is still cheaper than the projection of the MCF solution. The challenge here is that such a \u201cgood\u201d candidate subspace for projection is hard to ﬁnd. It is problem dependent and no ﬁxed subspace always works. We prove the existence of such an elusive subspace without explicitly identifying it, through an argument of integrating the projected network coding and MCF solutions over all possible 1-D rays from origin.\nIn Sec. II-C, we prove that the cost advantage, the potential advantage of network coding over routing in terms of reducing data transmission cost, is always at least as high in networks than in space. Therefore, our result in this paper partially veriﬁes the original multiple unicast network coding conjecture in networks.\nPerhaps more interesting is that the new space information ﬂow perspective provides a promising direction for attacking the original conjecture itself. In a sibling work [5], we describe a geometric framework that is hopeful for eventually resolving the original conjecture. We brieﬂy preview this geometric framework, as well its connection to this work, in Sec. III-D.\nGiven that network coding is equivalent to routing for multiple unicast in a Euclidean space, it is interesting to ask whether the same holds for multicast. In two sibling work [3], [4], we study the multicast problem in space, with network coding explicitly considered. There we present examples that show network coding and routing are indeed different in space, prove upper-bounds on the cost advantage, analyze the achievability of optimality with ﬁnite solutions, and discuss the complexity of optimal multicast in a geometric space.\nWe represent an existing network, directed or undirected, using a graph G = (V, E). The vector c ∈ Z E + stores capacities of links in E. Here Z + is the set of positive integers. Another vector w ∈ Q E + represents the distance or cost of links in E, and w e can be interpreted as the cost of routing a unit ﬂow through that link. Here Q + represents the set of positive rational numbers.\nFor the min-cost multiple unicast problem, we consider k unicast sessions co-existing in network G, and let s i and t i be the sender and receiver of session i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. We use r to denote the target throughput vector of the k sessions, and r i is the required throughput of session i. Without network coding, a solution to the multiple unicast problem is a multicommodity ﬂow (MCF), which can be represented using a link ﬂow vector f ∈ Q E + . The min-cost MCF can be computed by solving a linear program [1], [2].\nA network coding solution to the multiple unicast problem has two components: (A) a ﬂow component, for how much ﬂow to transmit over each link, and (B) a coding component, for where and how to encode and decode the information ﬂows. We denote the underlying link ﬂow vector in (A) using f ∈ Q E + too. In undirected networks, a network coding scheme may be dynamic in that the transmission scheme is a time- slotted one (a convolutional code), and a different ﬂow routing and coding scheme is adopted in each different time slot [6], [10]. In this case, we simply let f e be the time-average ﬂow rate at link e. There is no known linear program of polynomial size that computes the min-cost network coding solution.\nIn the space information ﬂow problem, we are given a set of terminal nodes, with (multiple) unicast or multicast communication demand. The space we consider in this work is a h-D Euclidean space, h ≥ 1. A node u has coordinate (x 1,u , x 2,u , . . . , x h,u ). The Euclidean distance between two nodes u and v is\nGiven a space information ﬂow vector f , a network can be induced, over the same nodes and links as in f , by viewing f e as the capacity of e. The distance of e is denoted as ||e|| h . The cost of f is then e ||e|| h f e . This reﬂects the general rule that the longer and the wider a communication cable, the more expensive it is. For the sake of cost minimization, apparently, only straight line segments need to be considered in f .\nGiven two vectors → p and → q , → p · → q = ||p||||q||| cos θ| is the absolute value of the inner product of → p and → q , where θ is the angle between → p and → q .\nWe can establish a connection between the cost advantage in space and that in graphs. Given a problem instance, in the form of either multiple unicast or multicast, let β d , β u and β s be the max cost advantage possible in directed networks, undirected networks, and space, respectively. Then we have the following relation among the three:\nProof: We ﬁrst show that β d ≥ β u . Given the max cost advantage β u in undirected networks, let ∆ u be a problem instance where this cost advantage is achieved, and let f be the underlying ﬂow of the optimal network coding solution.\nWe can create a corresponding problem instance ∆ d for the directed setting, by viewing f as the directed network, while keeping the terminal nodes, link costs and target throughput intact. With network coding, the cost of the optimal solution is the same in ∆ d and in ∆ u . Without network coding, the cost of the optimal solution can only increase from ∆ u to ∆ d , since the latter is more restrictive. Therefore β d ≥ β u .\nThe proof to β u ≥ β s is similar, by viewing the underlying ﬂow f of the optimal network coding solution for ∆ s as an undirected network. The directions in f are ignored. The cost of a link e is taken as ||e|| h .\nGiven Theorem 2.1, we know that all upper-bounds on the cost advantage proven for the undirected model are still valid in the space model. Conversely, all lower-bounds that we can prove for the space model will also be valid for the undirected model. For example, an upper-bound of 2 is known for cost advantage in undirected multicast networks [15]\u2013[17]. This bound automatically holds for multicast in a space of any dimension. In Sec. III, we prove that the cost advantage for multiple unicast is always 1 in space. Unfortunately, this does not directly imply the multiple unicast conjecture in undirected networks. We discuss how this bound is connected to the conjecture in Sec. III-D.\nA. The Multiple Unicast Conjecture for Network Information Flow\nIn their original work where the multiple unicast conjecture was proposed [1], Li and Li ﬁrst formulated the conjecture in the throughput domain, and then applied linear programming duality to translate it into an equivalent version in the cost domain.\nThroughput domain: For k independent unicast sessions in a capacitated undirected network (G, c), a throughput vector r is feasible with network coding if and only if it is feasible with routing.\nCost domain: Let f be the underlying ﬂow vector of a network coding solution for k independent unicast sessions with throughput vector r, in a cost-weighted undirected network (G, w). Then e w e f e ≥ i d i r i , where d i is the shortest path distance between the sender and receiver of session i under metric w.\nIntuitively, the throughput version of the conjecture claims that network coding cannot help improve throughput, while the cost version claims that network coding cannot help reduce transmission cost. In the rest of this section, we prove the cost version of the multiple unicast conjecture for space information ﬂow, where the cost w e becomes, naturally, the Euclidean length ||e|| of link e.\nIn a 1-D space, each line segment (or edge) e between two neighboring vertices forms a cut of the network. The amount of ﬂow f 1 e over e has to be at least the total throughput\nrequirement of terminal pairs separated by the removal of e. We next prove that this implies the multiple unicast conjecture in 1-D space.\nTheorem 3.1. Given k independent unicast sessions in 1-D space, let f 1 be the underlying ﬂow vector of a network coding solution achieving a rate vector r. Then e ( ||e|| 1 f 1 e ) ≥\nProof: For a given point x in the 1-D space, let f 1 x be the total amount of ﬂow crossing x, in both directions. Note that the point x constitutes a cut of the 1-D space, and therefore f 1 x is lower-bounded by the ﬂow demand between the left sub-space ( −∞, x) and the right sub-space (x, ∞), denoted as Demand(( −∞, x); (x, ∞)). We integrate both sizes over the entire 1-D space, and obtain:\nFurthermore, note that e ( ||e|| 1 f 1 e ) = ∞ x= −∞ f 1 x dx. We conclude that e ( ||e|| 1 f 1 e ) ≥ i ( ||s i t i || 1 r i ). C. Multiple Unicast in h-D Space\nWe now consider multiple unicast demands in a h-D space, for h ≥ 2. While only the cases of h = 2 and h = 3 allow intuitive interpretations, the problem is as well-deﬁned for higher dimensions, which is helpful in connecting to the orig- inal multiple unicast conjecture in graphs, because embedding a graph metric into a geometric space often requires a high dimension space [5].\nWe prove the multiple unicast conjecture by projecting the problem from h-D to 1-D, and then apply Theorem 3.1. The requirement on the projection is: a coding solution has total cost less than the speciﬁed bound in the conjecture, only if it does so after the projection. The main difﬁculty of the proof is that an optimal or \u201cgood\u201d direction for projection is actually hard to ﬁnd. In particular, it is not sufﬁcient to always project onto one of the axes. We show indirect evidence instead, for the existence of such a good direction, by taking an integration over all possible rays at origin for projection.\nTheorem 3.2. For k independent unicast sessions in a h-D space, h ≥ 2, assume there is a network coding solution with underlying ﬂow vector f h , we have e (f h e ||e|| h ) ≥\nits network coding solution in 1-D by projecting their counter parts from h-D. Our goal is to show that there exists a 1-D sub- space/direction in the h-D space, onto which the projection satisﬁes e (f 1 e ||e|| 1 ) < i ( ||s i t i || 1 r i ), and therefore obtain a contradiction to Theorem 3.1.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, let Φ be the surface of the h-D unit hyper-sphere at the origin. We can enumerate all possible directions in h-D by traversing all points on Φ, and connecting to there from the origin. Let → p be the vector from origin to the corresponding point on Φ, let → 1 be the unit vector (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0).\nThe integration over the closed surface Φ for all the projec- tions of f h is:\nThe nice property of this integration is that it is separable, in the sense that we can perform integration for each link ﬂow segment ﬁrst, and then take the summation (= 1 ). Furthermore, we observe that when we integrate for each line segment, the orientation of that line segment does not matter, since we vary the projection direction to take all possible values (= 2 ).\nThe integration over the closed surface Φ for all the projec- tions of { → s i t i |i = 1, . . . , k} is:\nSince e (f h e ||e|| h ) < i ||s i t i || h by assumption, we claim that:\nSince the terms being integrated on both sides are non- negative, we claim that, there must exist a particular direction →\nComparing Theorem 3.2 with the original multiple unicast conjecture in undirected networks, we note that the two statements are rather similar. The only difference lies in the fact that Theorem 3.2 is based on Euclidean distances, whereas the conjecture is based on a cost metric induced from a graph. A natural direction for settling the conjecture is then to embed the graph metric into a geometric space, and then utilize Theorem 3.2.\nAn isometric embedding of a graph G into a space is one that preserves pairwise node distances in G. The distance between two nodes u and v in G is the shortest path length between u and v in G. By Theorem 3.2, we can see that, if there exists a certain space to which an isometric embedding of the network is feasible, and our projection based proof technique for dimension reduction can be adapted to carry through, then we can prove the multiple unicast conjecture. While no Euclidean space always permits isometric embedding of graphs, there do exist non-Euclidean spaces that satisfy this property [5]. For embedding into Euclidean spaces, if we relax the isometric requirement and allow a distance distortion ratio up to α in the embedding, we can prove the cost advantage is upper-bounded by α in the original graph.\nFollowing this direction, we present a geometric framework for studying the multiple unicast network coding conjecture in a sibling work [5]. The framework consists of four major steps: (i) translating the conjecture from throughput domain to cost domain, (ii) embed the network into an Euclidean or non-Euclidean space, in an isometric or low-distortion manner, (iii) reduce the problem from high-dimension space to low dimension space, and (iv) prove that there cannot be a counter example to the conjecture in low dimension.\nBased on this framework, we have been able to formulate a uniﬁed proof to a number of results, including (1) the conjecture holds for two unicast sessions, (2) the gap between a network coding solution and a routing solutions is at most O(log k), (3) the conjecture holds for uniform complete graphs, (4) the gap between a network coding solution and a routing solutions is at most √ 2 in uniform grid networks, (5) the conjecture is true in star networks [18], and (6) the conjecture is true in a class of inﬁnitely many layered or bipartite networks. Among these, (1) and (2) were known before, but were proved using different techniques. Results (3)- (6) are new and not previously known. The proofs to results (2), (3) and (4) resort to embedding into a Euclidean space, and directly build upon the main result in this work. The proofs to results (1), (5) and (6) resort to embedding into a non-Euclidean space instead, where isometric embedding of a graph metric is feasible.\nThis work is among the ﬁrst that studies the problem of space information ﬂow, with a focus on the case of multiple unicast sessions. We proved that for multiple unicast in a Euclidean space, network coding is equivalent to routing. This partially veriﬁes the well-known multiple unicast conjecture\nin network coding. This result, together with the new space information ﬂow perspective, leads to a new geometric frame- work for studying the original multiple unicast conjecture. For the paradigm of space information ﬂows, the multicast case appears even more interesting, where basic problems such as the computational complexity of the optimal multicast solution in space are yet to be investigated."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"Z.
