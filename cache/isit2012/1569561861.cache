A compound channel with an eavesdropper is called a compound wiretap channel. It is deﬁned as a family of pairs of channels {(W t , V t ) : t = 1, · · · , T } with common input alphabet and possibly different output alphabets, connecting a sender with two receivers, one legal and one wiretapper, where t is called a state of the channel pair (W t , V t ). The legitimate receiver accesses the output of the ﬁrst channel W t in the pair (W t , V t ), and the wiretapper observes the output of the second part V t in the pair (W t , V t ), respectively, when a state t governs the channel. A code for the channel conveys information to the legal receiver such that the wiretapper knows nothing about the transmitted information. This is a generalization of Wyner\u2019s wiretap channel [14] to the case of multiple channel states.\nWe will be dealing with two communication scenarios. In the ﬁrst one only the transmitter is informed about the index t (channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter), while in the second, the legitimate users have no information about that index at all (no CSI). The compound wiretap channels were recently introduced in [8]. An upper bound on the capacity under the condition that the average error goes to zero and the sender has no knowledge about CSI is obtained. The result of [8] was improved in [4] by using the stronger condition that the maximal error should go to zero. Furthermore, the capacity for the case with CSI was derived.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II we present some known results for classical compound wiretap channel. In Section III we derive the capacity of the classical compound quantum wiretap channel with CSI and give a lower bound of\nthe capacity without CSI. In this channel model the wiretapper uses classical quantum channels. In Section IV we derive the capacity of the classical quantum compound wiretap channel with CSI. In this model both the receiver and the wiretapper use classical quantum channels, and the set of the states can be both ﬁnite or inﬁnite.\nLet A, B, and C be ﬁnite sets, P (A), P (B), and P (C) be the sets of probability distributions on A, B, and C, respectively. Let θ := {1, · · · , T }. For every t ∈ θ let W t be a channel A → P (B) and V t be a channel A → P (C). We call (V t , W t ) t∈θ a compound wiretap channel. W n t and V n t stand for the n-th memoryless extensions of stochastic matrices W t and V t . Here the ﬁrst family represents the communication link to the legitimate receiver while the output of the latter is under control of the wiretapper. An (n, J n ) code for the compound wiretap channel (V t , W t ) t∈θ consists of stochastic encoders {E} : {1, · · · , J n } → P (A n ) and a collection of mutually disjoint sets {D j ⊂ B n : j ∈ {1, · · · , J n }} (decoding sets). A non-negative number R is an achievable secrecy rate for the compound wiretap channel (W t , V t ) in the case with CSI if there is a collection of (n, J n ) codes ({E t : t = 1, · · · , T }, {D j : j ∈ θ}) such that lim inf n→∞ 1 n log J n ≥ R , lim n→∞ max t max j x n ∈A n E t (x n |j)W n t (D c j |x n ) = 0 , lim n→∞ max t I(J ; Z n t ) = 0 , where J is an uniformly distributed random variable with value in {1, · · · , J n }.

Let θ := {1, · · · , T }. For every t ∈ θ let W t be a channel A → P (B) and V t be a classical quantum channel, i.e., a map A → S(H): A \t x → V t (x) ∈ S(H). We deﬁne (V t , W t ) t∈θ as a classical compound quantum wiretap channel. Associate to V t is the channel map on n-block V ⊗n t : A n → S(H ⊗N ) with V ⊗n t (x n ) := V t (x 1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ V t (x n ). S(·) denotes the von Neumann entropy and χ(·, ·) denotes the Holevo χ quantity.

Z t are the resulting random states at the output of wiretap channels.\nProof: Let p t , X (t) , and D j be deﬁned like in classical case. Then (1) still holds since the sender transmits through a classical channel to the legitimate receiver. We abbreviate X := {X (t) : t ∈ θ}. (Analogously, in the case without CSI, let p , X n , and D j be deﬁned like in classical case, then (3) still holds.)\nFor ρ ∈ S(H), and α > 0 there exists an orthogonal subspace projector Π ρ,α commuting with ρ ⊗n and satisfying (see [12])\nρ,α , \t (9) where a := #{A}, d := dim H, and K is a positive constant.

We have\n(Analogously there is a realization x j,l of X j,l with a positive probability such that J n j=1 1 J\nW n t (D c j |x j,l ) ≤ for all t ∈ θ and lim n→∞ max t∈θ χ(J ; Z ⊗n t ) = 0.) Combining (1) and (26) we obtain the results:\nE(x n |j)W n t (D c j |x n ) =: 1,n and sup t∈θ χ(J ; Z ⊗n t ) =: 2,n where lim n→∞ 1,n = 0 and lim n→∞ 2,n = 0. Let C(V t , W t ) denote the secretey capacity of the wiretap channel (V t , W t ) in the sense of [12]. Choose t ∈ θ such that C(V t , W t ) = min t∈θ C(V t , W t ). It is well- known, in information theory, that even in the case without wiretapper (we have only one classical channel W t ), the capacity cannot exceed I(J ; B t ) + ξ for any constant ξ > 0. Thus, the capacity of a quantum wiretap channel (W t , V t ) cannot be greater than\nfor any > 0. Since we cannot exceed the capacity of the worst wiretap channel we have\nLet H be a ﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert space. Let S(H) be the space of self-adjoint, positive-semideﬁnite bounded linear operators on H with trace 1. For every t ∈ θ let W t respectively V t be quantum channels, i.e., completely positive trace preserving maps S(H) → S(H). An (n, J n , λ) code for the classical quantum compound wiretap channel (W t , V t ) t∈θ consists of a family of vectors {w(j) : j = 1, · · · , J n } ⊂ S(H ⊗N ) and a collection of positive semi-deﬁnite operators {D j : j ∈ {1, · · · , J n }} ⊂ S(H ⊗N ) which is a partition of the identity, i.e. J n j=1 D j = id H ⊗N .

Z t are the resulting random states at the output of wiretap channels.\nTheorem 2: The capacity of the classical quantum com- pound wiretap channel in the case with CSI is given by\nwhere B t are the resulting random states at the output of legal receiver channels. Z t are the resulting random states at the output of wiretap channels.\nProof: Our idea is to send the information in two parts, ﬁrstly, we send the state information with ﬁnite blocks of ﬁnite bits with a code C 1 to the receiver, and then, depending on t, we send the message with a code C (t) 2 in the second part. We don\u2019t require that the ﬁrst part should be secure against the wiretapper, since we assume that the wiretapper already has full knowledge of the CSI. By ignoring the security against the wiretapper, we have only to consider the compound channel (W t ) t∈θ . Let W = (W t ) t be an arbitrary compound classical- quantum-channel. Then by [3], for each λ ∈ (0, 1) the λ- capacity C(W, λ) equals\nIf min t max p χ(p, W t ) > 0, then for any required upper bound λ > 0, the sender may send the state to the legal receiver by a code of sufﬁciently large but constant length such that with the probability at least 1− λ 2 the legal receiver decodes correctly. In case min t max p χ(p, W t ) = 0, we need to do nothing because in this case the right hand side of (27) is zero. The ﬁrst part is of length O(1), which is negligible compared to the second part.\nIf both the sender and the legal receiver have the full knowledge of t, then we only have to consider the single wiretap channel (W t , V t ). In [6] and [7] it is shown that there exists an (n, J n , λ) code for the quantum wiretap channel (W, V ) with\nfor any > 0, where B is the resulting random state at the output of legal receiver channel. Z is the output of the wiretap channel. When the sender and the legal receiver both know t, they can build an (n, J n,t , λ) code C (t) 2 where\n1 n\nFor any > 0 choose t ∈ θ such that C(V t , W t ) ≤ inf t∈θ C(V t , W t ) + . From [6] and [7], we know that the\ncapacity of the quantum wiretap channel (W t , V t ) cannot be greater than lim n→∞ max P,w t 1 n (χ(P, B ⊗n t ) − χ(P, Z ⊗n t )). Since we cannot exceed the capacity of the worst wiretap channel, we have\nIf for every t ∈ θ and n ∈ N, I(P, B ⊗n t ) ≥ I(P, Z ⊗n t ) for all P ∈ P (A) and {w t (j) : j = 1, · · · , J n } ⊂ S(H n ), we have C CSI = min t∈θ max P,w t (χ(P, B t ) − χ(P, Z t )) (see [11]).\nSo far, |θ| was ﬁnite. Now we consider the case when |θ| can be arbitrary.\n1 n\nwhere · 1 stands for the trace norm.

For every t ∈ θ the legal transmitters build a code C (t ) 2 = {w t , {D t ,j : j}}.

The bits that the sender uses to transform the CSI is large but constant, so it is still negligible compared to the second part. we have\n1 n\nWe thank Igor Bjelakovic and Holger Boche for useful discussions.
