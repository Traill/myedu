Before distribution of a copyrighted content, a ﬁngerprinting system embeds a unique identiﬁcation ﬁnger- print into each copy, which can be extracted and helps trace unauthorized redistribution. A collusion attack is a powerful attack by a group of malicious users called pirates who com- bine their copies to generate a new version that contains only weak traces of their ﬁngerprints. The goal of a ﬁngerprinting decoder is to identify the pirates even under severe collusion attacks.\nThe challenges of designing an effective ﬁngerprinting sys- tem are manyfold. Firstly, it is difﬁcult to construct a suitable uniﬁed model that describes the pirates\u2019 collusion activities for different applications. Secondly, theoretical studies have shown that the maximum achievable rate, or capacity, decays quadratically with the size of the coalition k [1]. Thirdly, re- cent constructions on capacity-achieving ﬁngerprinting codes require exponential computational complexity [2], [3] while efﬁcient designs fall short in achieving capacity [1], [3], [4].\nIn this work, we attempt to bring the theory one step closer to practical requirements. We revisit the games of ﬁngerprinting capacity [3], [5] under a modiﬁed version of the newly proposed combined digit model (CDM) by ˇSkori´c et al. [6]. Our earlier results in [5] are extended under this new CDM. For small coalitions, analytical or numerical solutions are evaluated for different setups. The results not only show how capacity depends on the model, but also shed light on the structures of capacity-achieving codes, and on how the colluders can maximally utilize their copies to avoid detection. Asymptotic analysis allows us to approximate capacity and optimal strategies when exact solution for large coalitions is not feasible. We show how the asymptotic analysis of [5] can be generalized to CDM. Also using the methods of variational\ncalculus, a set of Euler-Lagrange differential equations can be explicitly speciﬁed as necessary and sufﬁcient conditions. Saddle-point solutions can then be obtained either analytically or numerically.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Sec. II introduces our ﬁngerprinting model and brieﬂy reviews the results in [3], [5]. Sec. III and IV attack small- and large-coalitions games of ﬁngerprinting capacity respectively. Due to lack of space we have omitted many detailed derivations and explanations from this extended abstract. Details will be given in the full version of the paper.\nThe mutual information of random variables X and Y is denoted by I(X; Y ). The binary entropy function is denoted by h q (p) = −p log q p − (1 − p) log q (1 − p). The base-q Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability vectors p and q is denoted by D q (p q ). The indicator function denoted by δ ab takes value one if a = b and zero other- wise. The shorthand f ∼ g denotes the asymptotic equality lim k→∞ [f (k)/g(k)] = 1.\nLet X = Q = {0, 1, . . . , q − 1} denote a size-q alphabet, M = {1, . . . , M} denote the user index set, and W n a set of secret key values. An (n, M ) randomized ﬁngerprinting code C over X , or ﬁngerprinting ensemble, consists of an encoder- decoder pair (e n , d n ). The encoder\nassigns user m a length-n ﬁngerprint X m = e n (m, W n ) where W n is the random key. The mapping e n is known to the public but the realization of W n is kept secret from the pirates.\nA coalition is formed by a subset of k users. With- out loss of generality, we denote the set of indices by K = {1, . . . , k}. The colluders observe ﬁngerprint sequences X K = {X 1 , . . . , X k } and use them to produce a forgery Y ∈ Y n . The process can be modeled by passing X K through a collusion channel p Y |X K .\nBased upon the received forgery and the secret key W n , the decoder\naccuses a subset of users ˆ K. An error occurs either when ˆ K is not equal to K (detect-all criterion) or when ˆ K is empty or contains some innocent user m / ∈ K (detect-one criterion). Our complete model of the ﬁngerprinting system is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe set of admissible collusion channels determines the coalition\u2019s capability of manipulating the ﬁngerprint sequences available to them. The Boneh-Shaw marking assumption and its nonbinary alphabet variants [7], [8] are the most commonly adopted model in the literature. However, these models fail to completely capture plausible colluders\u2019 actions. ˇSkori´c et. al. [6] recently proposed a more general setup called the combined digit model. However, it combines the collusion and the decoding process and is very hard to analyze. Here we introduce a modiﬁed version of CDM which is tractable and retains the spirit of the original model. We show how all variants of the marking assumption ﬁt into our new model and the trade-off among parameters.\nwhich implies that for each coordinate i the forgery symbol y i depends only on x 1,i , . . . , x k,i . Therefore the collusion can be characterized by the single-lettered channel p Y |X K and we will drop the coordinate index i in the following analysis. We also assume the channel to be user-symmetric, which means that the forgery depends only on the sequences available to the coalition, but not on which pirates receiving them. Here we let Z = [Z 0 , Z 1 , . . . , Z q−1 ] ∈ {0, . . . , k} q with\nand let Z \t z ∈ {0, . . . , k} q : q−1 x=0 z x = k = {z j } t j=1 (where t |Z|) be the set of all possible Z. Based on the user- symmetry assumption, Z is a sufﬁcient statistic in generating Y , and the colluders\u2019 strategy can be modeled by the set {θ(z)} z ∈Z where\nWe let Y = Q ∪ {e} where \u2018e\u2019 denotes an erasure. Our modiﬁed CDM admits two parameter vectors: r c =\n[r c ,1 , . . . , r c ,q−1 ] speciﬁes upper bounds for generating an unseen symbol in Q, and r e = [r e ,1 , . . . , r e ,q ] speciﬁes upper bounds for generating an erasure. More speciﬁcally, a collusion channel {θ(z)} z ∈Z is admissible if and only if it satisﬁes the linear constraints\nwhere N (z) ≤ k denotes the number of distinct symbols seen by the pirates.\nThis is indeed a fairly general model as it reduces to the following four variants of the marking assumption in the literature with different choices of r c and r e :\n\u2022 Restricted digit model (RDM): RDM only allows the colluders to \u201cmix and match\u201d their copies of the content, i.e., Y can only be one of the symbols in X K .\n\u2022 Unreadable digit model (UDM): UDM allows slightly stronger attacks. Besides the symbols they have, the colluders can also generate an erasure when N (z) > 1.\n\u2022 Arbitrary digit model (ADM): ADM does not allow erasures, but Y can be any symbol in Q when N(z) > 1. In Sec. III we show that ADM allows stronger attacks than UDM.\n\u2022 General digit model (GDM): GDM allows Y to be any symbol in Q or an erasure when N(z) > 1. This allows the strongest attacks.\nTable I summarizes the parameters corresponding to dif- ferent models. It also shows realistic values of parameters based on simulations in [6]. Collusion classes are denoted by P RDM , P UDM , etc. for speciﬁc models or P c in general. Collusion channels in our following analysis are represented by the (q + 1) × t matrix Θ [θ(z 1 ), · · · , θ(z t )].\nGiven a ﬁngerprinting code C and a class P c of collusion channels, the worst-case error probabilities under the detect-all and the detect-one criteria are deﬁned by\nwhere the error event E is given by E all = ˆ K = K and E one = ˆ K \\ K = ∅ ∪ ˆ K ∩ K = ∅ for P all e,k ( C, P c ) and P one e,k ( C, P c ) respectively. The rate of a code C is deﬁned by\nn −1 log q M , and a rate R is deemed achievable if there exists a sequence of rate- R ﬁngerprinting codes with vanishing worst- case error probability. The ﬁngerprinting capacities C one k,q ( P c ) and C all k,q ( P c ) are deﬁned as the suprema of all achievable rates with respect to the detect-one and detect-all criteria, respectively.\nAs studied in [3], [5], the following two-phase ﬁngerprinting construction and joint/simple decoding scheme approaches or achieves capacity:\n1) Encoding scheme: Let P W be a probability distribution on the (q − 1)-dimensional simplex W q { w 1 = 1 } . A sequence of auxiliary random variables {W i } n i=1 is drawn independent and identically from the distribution P W . For each i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, {X m,i } M m=1 are M independent and identically distributed random variables constructed from a categorical distribution with parameter W i . The class of all probability distributions on W q is denoted by P W , and P e denotes a compact subset of P W .\n2) Decoding scheme: Two decoding schemes are proposed in [3]. The simple decoder evaluates the empirical mutual information I(x m ; y |w) for each user m and user m is accused if and only if I(x m ; y |w) > η simple for some threshold η simple . The joint decoder evaluates the score S( A) = I(x A ; y |w) − |A|η joint for each coalition A ⊆ M where η joint is a threshold. The set A that has the largest score is then accused.\nDeﬁne the joint and simple capacities C joint k,q ( P e , P c ) and C simple k,q ( P e , P c ) respectively by\nThe expressions in (1) and (2) can be uniﬁed by C k,q ( P e , P c ) = max\nif we let I joint k,q (w, Θ) \t 1 k I(Z; Y |W = w ) and I simple k,q (w, Θ) I(X 1 ; Y |W = w). The expectation E is taken with respect to P W . Also if P e = P W , then we drop the ﬁrst argument P e of (1)-(3) for simplicity. The following theorem summarizes the results in [3], [5].\nTheorem 1: (i) With embedding distribution P W and the joint (resp. simple) decoding scheme, any rate below C joint k,q ( {P W }, P c ) (resp. C simple k,q ( {P W }, P c )) is achiev- able.\ni.e., the joint decoding scheme achieves capacity while the simple decoding scheme is generally suboptimal (the inequality is in general strict).\n(iii) Both the payoff functions I joint k,q and I simple k,q are convex in Θ. Therefore the maximin game of (3) admits a\nsaddle-point solution and the maximin value equals to its minimax value, i.e.,\nThe maximizing and minimizing strategies are denoted by P (k,q) W and Θ (k,q) respectively.\nIt is worth mentioning that although the simple decoding scheme fails to achieve capacity, its computational complexity is much lower than that of the joint decoding scheme. In Sec. IV we show that the gap between C joint k,q ( P c ) and C simple k,q ( P c ) is actually negligible for large k.\nOwing to the existence of the saddle-point solutions, the joint and simple ﬁngerprinting capacity games can be solved either analytically or numerically when k is small. In [5] we showed the solutions for the binary alphabet case. Our algorithm can be generalized to the q-ary alphabet with the combined digit model. Also besides the user-symmetry con- straint discussed in Sec. II, we impose symbol-symmetry on both the embedding distribution P W and the collusion channel Θ. This constraint enforces both players to treat each symbol equally and greatly simpliﬁes the analysis. The optimality of symbol-symmetric strategies is discussed in [5].\nFor k = 1, the joint and simple capacity games are the same. The maximin game of (3) reduces to a compound channel capacity game, or to a watermarking game [3]. For the four variants of the marking assumption, capacity is trivially one. For CDM, the optimal embedding distribution is W (k,q) x ≡ 1/q for all x ∈ X . Upon receiving z = [1, 0, · · · , 0] , the colluder utilizes strategy θ (z) = [1 − p c − p e , p c /(q − 1), · · · , p c /(q − 1), p e ] where p c is the crossover probability and p e is the erasure probability. The optimal strategy is p (k,q) e = r e ,1 and p (k,q) c = min q−1 q (1 − r e ,1 ), r c ,1 . Capacity is given by\nwhere (x) + max(x, 0). Using parameters in [6], the loss in capacity from the ideal case is about 20% if parameters are chosen properly.\nBy studying the simplest case involving collusion at- tacks, we can see how different models allow different strengths of attacks. By symbol-symmetry there are only two types of patterns in Z, namely z 1 = [2, 0, . . . , 0]\nand z 2 = [1, 1, 0, . . . , 0] . Similar to the analysis in III-A, the crossover probabilities p c and the erasure probabili- ties p e determine the collusion attack. More speciﬁcally, we let θ (z 1 ) = 1 − p c ,1 − p e ,1 , p c,1 q−1 , · · · , p c,1 q−1 , p e ,1 and\nand p (k,q) e . Numerical solutions for the joint capacity game for binary and ternary alphabets are shown in Table II.\nThe analysis in Sec. III allows us to solve the ﬁngerprinting games for small coalitions. However, the solution itself has cardinality in Θ(k q−1 ). For the binary case the complexity grows linearly with k and we showed the solutions for up to tens of pirates [5]. For the nonbinary case, the curse of dimensionality makes the task difﬁcult even for small k. There- fore good approximations of the games\u2019 solutions for large- coalition asymptotics ( k → ∞) are important. Independently of this work, Boesten and ˇSkori´c [9] extended our asymptotic results in [5] to nonbinary alphabets under RDM. The analysis showed that the asymptotic joint capacity is (q −1)/(2k 2 ln q) but it did not reveal the optimal strategies. Here we show how we can extend our analysis of [5] to the more general combined digit model for both the joint and simple capacity games. Our main results are the following theorems:\nTheorem 2: Assume that Condition 1 (deﬁned below) is satisﬁed, then we have\nwhen A (deﬁned below in (12)) is nonzero. Note that A depends on the embedding distribution class P e and the collusion class P c and is independent of the coalition size k.\nTheorem 3: The ﬁngerprinting capacities under RDM sat- isﬁes\nFurthermore, P ∗ W ∝ x w −1/2 x (which belongs to the family of Dirichlet distributions) and the interleaving attack θ ∗ (z) =\nz are the respective maximizing and minimizing strategies that achieve the asymptotic capacity value.\nWe consider the sequence of joint/simple ﬁngerprinting games. Similarly to [5], we impose a regularity condition on the collusion channel Θ:\nCondition 1: There exists a bounded and twice differen- tiable function g : W q → W q+1 such that\nThe condition assumes a smooth limiting function for the sequence of collusion channels. For the binary case, the assumption seems valid for the joint capacity game but not for the simple capacity game [5]. However, as the simple decoding scheme is indeed suboptimal, we assume the colluders do not exploit such suboptimality and perform the optimal attack in terms of capacity.\nBy the deﬁnitions in Sec. II, the conditional distribution of Z given w follows the multinomial law with parameter w and k trials. We denote the probability mass functions by α z (w) \t p Z |W (z |w) for z ∈ Z and w ∈ W q . Let α (w) = [α z\n(w), . . . , α z t (w)] be a length-t probability vector. Similarly α x z (w) \t p Z |X 1 W (z |x, w) for x ∈ X , z ∈ Z, and w ∈ W q .\nUnder the regularity constraint, the following theorem re- duces the payoff functions for the joint/simple capacity games to a functional T [w, g, g ] where g is the (q + 1) × q Jacobian matrix of g.\nSketch of the proof: We can rewrite the mutual informa- tion of the payoff functions as\nBy Condition 1 and Taylor\u2019s Theorem we can write θ (z), Θα, and Θα x in terms of the Jacobian matrix g and the Hessian matrix 2 g. The expressions of (8)-(9) can be obtained by substituting these expansions into (10)-(11) and then applying the chi-square approximation.\nTheorem 4 reduces the asymptotic ﬁngerprinting capacity game to the following functional maximin game:\nwhere P W belongs to P e and g belongs to the class as- sociated with P c . For the binary case ( q = 2) under the marking assumption (which is equivalent to RDM, UDM, ADM, and GDM), the minimization problem of (12) can be solved explicitly for ﬁxed P W using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and the maximization problem can then be solved using another Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Indeed since the game of (12) has a convex payoff functional with respect to g (analogous to Theorem 1), there exists a saddle-point solution pair (P ∗ W , g ∗ ), which are the arcsine distribution and the interleaving attack for the binary case. They are the maximizing and minimizing strategies for the capacity game [5].\nFor the nonbinary case under the combined digit model, the Cauchy-Schwarz trick does not yield the analytic solution in general. However, the convexity of the payoff functional and the saddle-point property still hold, and we can solve the problem using variational calculus. A set of Euler-Lagrange differential equations can be explicitly speciﬁed as necessary and sufﬁcient conditions, and saddle-point solutions can be obtained either analytically or numerically.\nwhere · F is the Frobenius norm and · 2 is the Euclidean norm. Nota that the functional T depends only on v and h. If we deﬁne V q the manifold of points on the unit hypersphere in the ﬁrst hyperoctant {v : v 2 = 1 and 0 ≤ v x ≤ 1, x ∈ X }, then v ∈ V q and h : V q → V q+1 . We need to solve the maximin problem\nwhere the minimization is subject to constraints h ∈ V q+1 and the boundary conditions associated with the combined digit model. For example, RDM enforces that\nv y = 0 ⇒ h y (v) = 0, ∀y ∈ Y, v ∈ V q . \t (15) The following lemmas enable us to set up the Euler-\nLemma 1 ([10], Sec. 12): Let L[h] be a functional of the form\ndeﬁned on function vector h (v) which has continuous ﬁrst and second derivatives in Ω. Suppose the admissible function vector lies on the smooth hypersphere G[v, h] = 0 and satisﬁes certain conditions on the boundary ∂Ω of Ω. Then a necessary condition for L[h] to have an extremum for a\ngiven function h (v) is that there exists a function λ(v) such that h (v) satisﬁes Euler-Lagrange equations\nLemma 2 ([11], Chap. 2): If (h, h ) → F [v, h, h] is (strictly) convex for every v ∈ Ω and G[v, h] = 0, then h(v) satisfying the conditions in Lemma 1 is a (unique) minimizer of L[h].\nTheorem 5: Suppose P V has a continuous pdf f V (v) on V q . Then the functional\nsubject to h ∈ V q+1 and boundary conditions associated with the model has a minimizer h ∗ (v) satisfying\nSketch of the proof: Applying Lemma 1 by letting F = T V f , G = h 2 2 − 1, and Ω = V q , we can establish the theorem by applying Lemma 2.\nCorollary 1: We consider RDM and the uniform distribu- tion P ∗ V on V q . The identity mapping h ∗ (v) = v is the unique minimizer of (17). Moreover, (P ∗ V , h ∗ ) is the saddle-point solution pair to the maximin problem of (14).\nRemark 1: Changing variables v and h back to w and g, it is easy to verify that h ∗ = v corresponds to the interleaving attack g ∗ = w, and the uniform distribution of P ∗ v corresponds to P ∗ w ∝ x w −1/2 x \t which is the Jeffreys\u2019 prior for the multinomial model. Therefore Theorem 3 follows."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"G. Tardos"}],"title":{"text":"Optimal probabilistic ﬁngerprint codes"}},{"authors":[{"name":"E. Amiri"},{"name":"G.
