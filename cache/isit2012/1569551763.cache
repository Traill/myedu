This strategy achieves non-trivial rates for classical communication over a quantum relay channel."},"body":{"text":"Suppose that a Source wishes to communicate with a remote Destination. Suppose further that a Relay is available that can decode the messages transmitted by the Source during one time slot and forward them to the Destination during the next time slot. With the Relay\u2019s help, the Source and Destination can improve communication rates because the Destination can decode the intended messages in parallel from the channel outputs at two consecutive time slots. In this way, useful information is received both from the Source and the Relay.\nThe relay channel has been studied extensively in the context of classical information theory [1], [2], [3]. There, the discrete memoryless relay channel is modelled as a con- ditional probability distribution p(y 1 , y|x, x 1 ), where y 1 and y are the respective outputs at the Relay and Destination whenever the Source and Relay input symbols x and x 1 . Two important families of coding strategies exist for relay channels: compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward [1], [3]. The partial decode-and-forward strategy differs from the decode- and-forward strategy in that it has the Relay decode only part of the message from the Source [1].\nThe study of quantum channels with information-theoretic techniques has been an active area for some time now [4]. Theoretical interest has focused on classical-quantum channels of the form (X , N X→B (x) ≡ ρ B x , H B ), where, for each of the inputs x ∈ X , there corresponds an output quantum state, de- scribed by a density operator ρ B x in a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space H B . Classical-quantum channels are a useful abstraction for studying general quantum channels and correspond to the transmitters being restricted to classical encodings. In this setting, single-letter formulas characterize the capacity of point-to-point [5], [6] and multiple-access channels [7] and give achievable rates for other network channels [8], [9], [10].\nThe study of quantum channels ﬁnds practical applica- tions in optical communications. Bosonic channels model the\nquantum aspects of optical communication channels, where information is encoded into continuous degrees of freedom. It is known that collective quantum measurements on bosonic- channel outputs outperform classical strategies, particularly in the low-photon-number regime [11]. In other words, quantum measurements are necessary to achieve their ultimate capacity. Ref. [11] also demonstrates that classical encoding is sufﬁcient to achieve the Holevo capacity of the lossy bosonic channel, giving further motivation for the theoretical study of classical- quantum models.\nIn this paper, we develop a \u201cpartial decode and forward\u201d strategy for classical-quantum relay channels. Our results here are the ﬁrst extension of the quantum simultaneous decoding techniques used in [8], [9] to multi-hop networks. In the partial-decode-and-forward strategy given here, the Relay de- codes part of the Source\u2019s message in one block and forwards it in the next. The Destination performs a novel \u201csliding- window\u201d quantum measurement to decode both parts of the Source\u2019s message in two consecutive blocks [12], [2] and in doing so allows for the Source and Destination to achieve non- trivial communication rates. We state our main result in the Section II, introduce the necessary background on quantum systems and quantum decoding in Section III, and give the proof in Section IV. We conclude and discuss open problems in Section V.\nA classical-quantum relay channel N is a map with two classical inputs x and x 1 and two output quantum systems B 1 and B. For each pair of possible input symbols (x, x 1 ) ∈ X × X 1 , the channel prepares a density operator ρ B 1 B x,x\ndeﬁned on the tensor-product Hilbert space H B 1 ⊗ H B :\nwhere B 1 is the Relay output and B is the Destination output. The theorem below captures the main result of our paper:\nTheorem 1 (Partial decode-forward inner bound). Let {ρ x,x 1 } be a cc-qq relay channel as in (1). Then a rate R is achievable, provided that the following inequality holds:\nwhere the information quantities are with respect to the classical-quantum state θ U XX 1 B 1 B ≡\nOur code construction employs codebooks {x n 1 }, {u n }, and {x n } generated according to the distribution p(x 1 )p(u|x 1 )p(x|u, x 1 ). We split the message for each block into two parts (m, ) ∈ M × L such that the rate R = R m + R . The Relay fully decodes the message and re- encodes it directly in the next block (without using binning). The Destination exploits a \u201csliding-window\u201d decoding strategy [12], [2] by performing a collective measurement on two consecutive blocks. In this approach, the message pair (m j , j ) sent during block j is decoded from the outputs of blocks j and j + 1, using an \u201c AND -measurement.\u201d\nIn this section, we introduce the notation used in our paper and some background information on quantum decoding.\n1) Quantum systems: We denote quantum systems as B 1 and B and the corresponding Hilbert spaces as H B 1 and H B . We represent quantum states of a system B with a density operator ρ B , which is a positive semi-deﬁnite operator with unit trace. Let H(B) ρ ≡ −Tr ρ B log 2 ρ B denote the von Neumann entropy of the state ρ B . In order to describe the \u201cdistance\u201d between two quantum states, we use the notion of trace distance . The trace distance between states σ and ρ is\nX \u2020 X [4]. Two states can substitute for one another up to a penalty proportional to the trace distance between them:\nProof: This follows from a variational characteriza- tion of trace distance as the distinguishability of the states under an optimal measurement M [4]: ρ − σ 1 = 2 max 0≤M ≤I Tr [M (ρ − σ)].\n2) Quantum decoding: In a communication scenario, the decoding operations performed by the receivers correspond to quantum measurements on the outputs of the channel. A quantum measurement is a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) {Λ m } m∈M on the system B n . To be a valid POVM, the set {Λ m } of |M| operators should all be positive semi- deﬁnite and sum to the identity: Λ m ≥ 0, \t m Λ m = I.\nSuppose we are given positive operators {P m } m∈M that are apt at detecting (Tr[P m ρ m ] ≥ 1 − ) and distinguishing (Tr[P m ρ m =m ] ≤ ) the output states produced by each mes- sage. We can construct a valid POVM (known as the square- root measurement [5], [6]) by normalizing these operators:\nThe error analysis of a square-root measurement is greatly simpliﬁed by using the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality. Lemma 2 (Hayashi-Nagaoka [13]). If S and T are operators such that 0 ≤ T and 0 ≤ S ≤ I, then\n3) Error analysis: In the context of our coding strategy, we analyze the average probability of error at the Relay:\nThe operators I − Γ j and I − Λ m j , j correspond to the complements of the correct decoding outcomes.\nDeﬁnition 1. An (n, R, ) partial-decode-and-forward code for the quantum relay channel consists of two codebooks {x n (m j , j )} m j ∈M, j ∈L and {x n 1 ( j )} j ∈L and decoding POVMs Γ j\nsuch that the average probability of error is bounded from above as p e = ¯ p R e + ¯ p D e ≤ .\nA rate R is achievable if there exists an (n, R − δ, ) quantum relay channel code for all , δ > 0 and sufﬁciently large n.\nThe channel is used for b blocks, each indexed by j ∈ {1, . . . , b}. Our error analysis shows that:\n\u2022 The Destination can simultaneously decode (m j , j ) from a collective measurement on the output systems of blocks j and j + 1.\nThe error analysis at the Relay is similar to that of the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland theorem [5], [6]. The mes- sage j can be decoded reliably, if the rate R obeys the following inequality:\nThe decoding at the Destination is a variant of the quantum simultaneous decoder from [8], [9]. To decode the message (m j , j ), the Destination uses a \u201csliding-window\u201d decoder, implemented as an \u201c AND -measurement\u201d on the outputs of blocks j and j + 1. This coding technique does not require binning at the Relay or backwards decoding at the Destination [12], [2].\nIn this section, we give the details of the coding strategy and analyze the probability of error at the Destination.\nCodebook construction. Fix a distribution p(u, x, x 1 ) and independently generate a different codebook for each block j:\n\u2022 Randomly and independently generate 2 nR sequences x n 1 ( j−1 ), j−1 ∈ 1 : 2 nR , according to\n\u2022 For each x n 1 ( j−1 ), randomly and conditionally inde- pendently generate 2 nR sequences u n ( j , j−1 ), j ∈\n\u2022 For each x n 1 ( j−1 ) and each corresponding u n ( j , j−1 ), randomly and conditionally independently generate 2 nR m sequences x n (m j , j , j−1 ), m j ∈ 1 : 2 nR m , according to the distribution:\nTransmission. The transmission of ( j , m j ) to the Desti- nation happens during blocks j and j + 1. At the beginning of block j, we assume that the Relay has correctly decoded the message j−1 . During block j, the Source inputs the new messages m j and j , and the Relay forwards the old message\nj−1 . That is, their inputs to the channel for block j are the codewords x n (m j , j , j−1 ) and x n 1 ( j−1 ), leading to the following state at the channel outputs:\nOur shorthand notation is such that the states are identiﬁed by the messages that they encode, and the codewords are implicit.\nDecoding at the Destination. We now determine a decod- ing POVM that the Destination can perform on the output systems spanning blocks j and j +1. The Destination is trying to recover messages j and m j given knowledge of j−1 .\nFirst let us consider forming decoding operators for block j + 1. Consider the state obtained by tracing over the systems X, U , and B 1 in (3):\nwhere τ B x 1 ≡ u,x p (u|x 1 ) p (x|x 1 , u) ρ B x,x 1 . Also, let ¯ τ B de- note the following state: ¯ τ B ≡ x\np (x 1 ) τ B x 1 . Corresponding to the above states are conditionally typical projectors [4] of the following form:\nLet us now form decoding operators for block j. Deﬁne the conditional typical projector for the state ρ (j) m\nwhere ¯ ρ B u,x 1 ≡ x p (x|x 1 , u) ρ B x,x 1 . Deﬁne also the doubly averaged state ¯ ¯ ρ B x 1 ≡ u,x p (x|x 1 , u) p (u|x 1 ) ρ B x,x 1 .\nThe following conditionally typical projectors will be useful in our decoding scheme:\nFinally, we combine the positive operators from (9) and (11) to form the \u201csliding-window\u201d positive operator:\nusing the formula in (5). This measure- ment is what we call the \u201c AND -measurement.\u201d\nError analysis at the Destination. In this section, we prove that the Destination can correctly decode the message pair (m j , j ) by employing the measurement {Λ B n (j) B n (j+1) m\n} on the output state ρ (j) m\nspanning blocks j and j + 1. The average probability of error for the Destination is given in (7). For now, we consider the error analysis for a single message pair (m j , j ):\nwhere we used the Hayashi-Nagaoka inequality (Lemma 2) to decompose the error operator (I − Λ B n (j) B n (j+1) m\n) into two components: (I) a term corresponding to the probability that the correct detector does not \u201cclick\u201d: (I − P B n (j) B n (j+1) m\n), and (II) another term corresponding to the probability that a wrong detector \u201cclicks\u201d: (\n. These two errors are analogous to the classical error events in which an output sequence y n is either not jointly typical with the correct codeword or is jointly typical with another codeword.\nWe will bound the expectation of the average probability of error E U n X n X n 1 ¯ p D e , using the properties of typical projectors [4], and the following lemmas:\nLemma 4 (Gentle Operator Lemma for Ensembles [15]). Let {p(x) , ρ x } be an ensemble and let ¯ ρ ≡ x p(x) ρ x . If an operator Λ, where 0 ≤ Λ ≤ I, has high overlap with the average state, Tr [ Λ ¯ ρ ] ≥ 1 − , then the subnormalized state √\nΛ is close in trace distance to the original state ρ x on average: E X\nBy taking the expectation over the code randomness, we obtain the upper bound:\nThe inequality follows from E U n X n |X n 1 ρ (j+1) m j+1 , j+1 , j = τ j , the properties of typical projectors [4]: E X n 1 Tr[Π (j+1) τ j τ j ] ≥ 1 − , Tr[Π (j+1) ¯ τ \t ¯ τ ] ≥ 1 − and Lemma 4.\na) Matching j , wrong m j : By performing the error analysis for the case where j is decoded correctly, but m j is decoded incorrectly, we obtain the bound R m < I(X; B|U X 1 ) = H(B|U X 1 ) − H(B|U XX 1 ) − δ, using the\nWe now upper bound expression x using (13) and take the conditional expectation with respect to X n :\nsince m j = m j . The resulting expression in y has the state ¯ ρ (j)\nsandwiched between its typical projector on both sides, and so we can use (14). After these steps, we obtain the upper bound:\nThe inequalities follow because each operator inside the trace is positive semideﬁnite and less than the identity.\nb) Wrong j (and thus wrong m j ): We obtain the bound R ≡ R + R m ≤ I(XX 1 ; B) = I(X 1 ; B) + I(U X; B|X 1 )\nWe want to calculate the expectation of (B) under the code randomness E U n X n X n 1 . The random variables in different blocks are independent, and so we can analyze the expectations of the terms (B1) and (B2) separately.\nConsider ﬁrst the calculation in block j, which leads to the following bound on the expectation of (B1):\n   \n   \n   \n   \n, and we can bound the expression in { using (19). The ﬁrst inequality follows because all the other terms in the trace are positive operators less than the identity. The ﬁnal inequality follows from (18).\nCombining the upper bounds on (B1) and (B2) gives our ﬁnal upper bound:\nBy choosing the size of message sets to satisfy equations (8), (15) and (20), the expectation of the average probability of error becomes arbitrarily small for n sufﬁciently large.\nWe proved achievability of the rates given by the partial decode and forward inner bound, thus extending the study of classical-quantum channels to multi-hop scenarios. An inter- esting open question is to determine a compress-and-forward strategy for the quantum setting. Another avenue for research would be to consider quantum communication scenarios, and results here might have applications for the design of quantum repeaters. I.
