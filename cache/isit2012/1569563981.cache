Due to its potential rele- vance to video coding applications, this problem has received renewed interests in recent years [2], [3]. In a sequential coding system, L sources X 1 , · · · , X L , each representing a video frame, are encoded and decoded in a causal manner, where Encoder i has access to X 1 , · · · , X i , i = 1, · · · , L, and Decoder i reconstructs X i based on the outputs from the ﬁrst i encoders, i = 1, · · · , L. If Encoder i is only allowed to have access to X i as well as the outputs from the ﬁrst i − 1 encoders (if i ≥ 2), then the resulting problem is known as predictive coding. It is shown in [4] that the rate regions of these two coding problems are identical if X 1 −X 2 −· · ·−X L form a Markov chain. Note that this Markov chain condition is trivially satisﬁed when L = 2.\nThe existing coding schemes for sequential coding and pre- dictive coding rely critically on the assumption that Decoder i has access to the ﬁrst i encoded frames (i.e., the outputs from the ﬁrst i encoders) when reconstructing the ith frame (i.e., X i ). As a consequence, these schemes are vulnerable to the loss of encoded frames at the decoder end. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a robust version of these two coding problems. Speciﬁcally, we require that Decoder i has to meet a certain ﬁdelity constraint even when it only has access to the ith encoded frame (i.e., the output from the ith encoder).\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We state our main results in Section II. Section III contains a class of extremal inequalities, which will play an important role in subsequent analysis. The proofs of some main results are given in Sections IV and V. We conclude the paper with a discussion of certain minimax theorems inspired by our analysis.\nThroughout this paper, for any random object W and 1 × n random vector X n we deﬁne σ 2 X n = 1 n E[X n (X n ) T ] and\nIn this work we focus on the special case where X 1 − X 2 − · · · − X L form a Gauss-Markov chain. With no essential loss of generality, we assume X i +1 = X i + ∆ i , i = 1, · · · , L −\n1, where X 1 , ∆ 1 , · · · , ∆ L −1 are mutually independent zero- mean Gaussian random variables with σ 2 X 1 > 0 and σ 2 ∆ i > 0, i = 1, · · · , L−1. Let {(X 1 (t), · · · , X L (t))} ∞ t =1 be i.i.d. copies of (X 1 , · · · , X L ).\nDeﬁnition 1: A rate vector R (R 1 , · · · , R L ) is said to be achievable with a sequential coding system subject to individ- ual distortion constraint d (d {1} , · · · , d {L} ) and hierarchical distortion constraint δ (δ {1,2} , · · · , δ {1,··· ,L} ) if there exist encoding functions f (n) i : R i ×n → C i , i = 1, · · · , L, such that\nwhere C i = f (n) i (X n 1 , · · · , X n i ), i = 1, · · · , L. The rate region R S (d, δ) is the closure of the set of all the rate vectors achievable with a sequential coding system subject to individual distortion constraint d and hierarchical distortion constraint δ.\nDeﬁnition 2: A rate vector R \t (R 1 , · · · , R L ) is said to be achievable with a predictive coding system subject to individual distortion constraint d \t (d {1} , · · · , d {L} ) and hierarchical distortion constraint δ (δ {1,2} , · · · , δ {1,··· ,L} ) if there exist encoding functions f (n) 1 : R n → C 1 and f (n) i : C 1 × · · · × C i −1 × R n → C i , i = 2, · · · , L, such that\nwhere C 1 = f (n) 1 (X n 1 ) and C i = f (n) i (C 1 , · · · , C i −1 , X n i ), i = 2, · · · , L. The rate region R P (d, δ) is the closure of the set of all the rate vectors achievable with a predictive system subject to individual distortion constraint d and hierarchical distortion constraint δ.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume 0 < d {i} ≤ σ 2 X i , i = 1, · · · , L, and 0 < δ {1,··· ,i} ≤ σ 2 X i , i = 2, · · · , L. Since both R S (d, δ) and R P (d, δ) are closed convex sets, it sufﬁces to characterize their supporting hyperplanes, i.e., to solve the following optimization problems\nwhere α = (α 1 , · · · , α L ) with α i ≥ 0, i = 1, · · · , L.

The proof of Theorem 3 is omitted. These theorems together provide a characterization of certain supporting hyperplanes of R S (d, δ) and R P (d, δ). In particular, setting α 1 = · · · = α L = 1 gives the minimum sum rate of these two rate regions. For the special case L = 2, one can verify that κ l (α, d, δ) and κ u (α, d, δ) have the following explicit expression:\n    \n   \nThe extremal inequality in the following theorem is a generalization of the one in [5, Lemma 1].
