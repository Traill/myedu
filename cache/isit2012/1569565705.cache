A binary linear code is a subspace of Z n 2 . A quaternary linear code is a subgroup of Z n 4 .\nIn [3] Delsarte deﬁnes additive codes as subgroups of the underlying abelian group in a translation association scheme. For the binary Hamming scheme, the only structures for the abelian group are those of the form Z α 2 × Z β 4 , with α + 2β = n [2]. Thus, the subgroups C of Z α 2 × Z β 4 are the only additive codes in a binary Hamming scheme which were ﬁrst deﬁned in [6] and then later deeply studied in [1].\nAs in [4] and [1], we deﬁne an extension of the usual Gray map. We deﬁne Φ : Z α 2 × Z β 4 −→ Z n 2 , where n = α + 2β, given by Φ(x, y) = (x, φ(y 1 ), . . . , φ(y β )) for any x ∈ Z α 2 and any y = (y 1 , . . . , y β ) ∈ Z β 4 , where φ : Z 4 −→ Z 2 2 is the usual Gray map, that is, φ(0) = (0, 0), φ(1) = (0, 1), φ(2) = (1, 1), φ(3) = (1, 0).\nSince C is a subgroup of Z α 2 × Z β 4 , it is also isomorphic to an abelian structure Z γ 2 × Z δ 4 . Therefore, C is of type 2 γ 4 δ as a group, it has |C| = 2 γ+2δ codewords and the number of order two codewords in C is 2 γ+δ . Let X (respectively Y ) be the set of Z 2 (respectively Z 4 ) coordinate positions, so |X| = α and |Y | = β. Unless otherwise stated, the set X corresponds to the ﬁrst α coordinates and Y corresponds to the last β coordinates. Call C X (respectively C Y ) the punctured code of C by deleting the coordinates outside X (respectively Y ). Let\nC b be the subcode of C which contains all order two codewords and let κ be the dimension of (C b ) X , which is a binary linear code. For the case α = 0, we will write κ = 0. Considering all these parameters, we will say that C, or equivalently C = Φ(C), is of type (α, β; γ, δ; κ).\nDeﬁnition 1: Let C be a Z 2 Z 4 -additive code, which is a subgroup of Z α 2 ×Z β 4 . We say that the binary image C = Φ(C) is a Z 2 Z 4 -linear code of binary length n = α + 2β and type (α, β; γ, δ; κ), where γ, δ and κ are deﬁned as above.\nThe generator matrix for a Z 2 Z 4 -additive code C of type (α, β; γ, δ; κ) can be written in the following standard form [1]:\nI κ T 2T 2 \t 0 \t 0 0 0 2T 1 2I γ−κ 0 0 S \t S \t R \t I δ\nwhere T , T 1 , T 2 , R, S are matrices over Z 2 and S is a matrix over Z 4 . Let 0 be the all-zero vector or matrix. The dimension of these vectors or matrices will be clear from the context.\nThe Hamming weight of a vector v X ∈ Z α 2 is the number of its nonzero coordinates and it is denoted by wt H (v X ). The Hamming distance between two vectors v X , u X ∈ Z α 2 is the number of coordinates in which v X and u X differ from one another, and it is denoted by d H (v X , u X ). The Lee weights of 0, 1, 2, 3 ∈ Z 4 are 0, 1, 2, 1 respectively. The Lee weight of a vector v Y = (v 1 , . . . , v β ) ∈ Z β 4 is then w L (v Y ) =\nv Y , u Y ∈ Z β 4 is d L (v Y , u Y ) = wt L (v Y − u Y ). For a vector v = (v X , v Y ) ∈ Z α 2 × Z β 4 , deﬁne the weight of v, denoted by wt(v), as wt H (v X ) + wt L (v Y ) and for v, u ∈ Z α 2 × Z β 4 deﬁne the distance as d(v, u) = wt(v − u).\nThe map Φ is an isometry which transforms distances in Z α 2 × Z β 4 to Hamming distances in Z α+2β 2 \t .\nIn [1], the following inner product is deﬁned for any two vectors u, v ∈ Z α 2 × Z β 4 :\nThe Z 2 Z 4 -additive dual code of C, denoted by C ⊥ , is deﬁned in the standard way\nIf C = C ⊥ , then we say that C is a self-dual code. If C ⊆ C ⊥ , meaning all vectors are orthogonal to each other, then we say that C is self-orthogonal. If C = φ(C), the binary code Φ(C ⊥ ) is denoted by C ⊥ and called the Z 2 Z 4 -dual code of C. Z 2 Z 4 - additive self-dual codes were studied in [5].\nLet C be a Z 2 Z 4 -additive code. If C = C X × C Y , then C is called separable. If C is a separable Z 2 Z 4 -additive code, then the generator matrix of C in standard form is\nI κ T \t 0 \t 0 \t 0 0 0 \t 2T 1 2T γ−κ 0 0 0 \t S \t R \t I δ\nDeﬁnition 2: A binary code C is antipodal if for any codeword c ∈ C, we have c + 1 ∈ C. If C is a Z 2 Z 4 -additive code then we say that C is antipodal if Φ(C) is antipodal, where Φ(C) is the binary image of C.\nDeﬁnition 3: If a Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code has odd weights, then it is said to be of Type 0. If the code has only even weights then we say that the code is of Type I and if the code has only doubly even weights then it is a Type II code.\nIn [5] it is proven that if C is a Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code then the following statements hold:\n(i) C is antipodal if and only if C is Type I or Type II. (ii) If C is separable then C is antipodal.\nTherefore a Type 0 code is non-antipodal and non-separable. A Type I or Type II code is antipodal and separable or non- separable.\nTheorem 1: [5] Let C be a Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code of type (α, β; γ, δ; κ) with α, β > 0.\n(iii) If C is Type I and non-separable, then α ≥ 4, β ≥ 4. (iv) If C is Type II, then α ≥ 8, β ≥ 4.\nThe following table combines all the results given above for Type 0, I and II codes.\nThe construction technique that is described below is from [5]. In [5] examples are given for all the minimum values of α and β that are given in Table I. In this paper we shall extend Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual codes retaining the original properties like the type of the code and separability.\nLet C be a Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code of type (α, β; γ, δ; κ) and let v ∈ Z α 2 × Z β 4 with v / ∈ C. We\ndeﬁne C v = { u ∈ C| [u, v] = 0}. It is immediate that C v is a subgroup of C and that the index [C : C v ] is either 2 or 4. In either case we have [C : C v ] = [C ⊥ v : C] and C ⊥ v = C, v . Let w be a vector such that C = C v , w . We can then write C ⊥ v = C, v, w . We shall form a code ¯ C by extending the code C = C ⊥ v in the following manner.\nFor u = (u X , u Y ) ∈ C ⊥ v we let ¯ u = (u X , u X , u Y , u Y ) where u X is an extension of the binary part and u Y is an extension of the quaternary part. Then let ¯ C = ¯ u| u ∈C ⊥ v .\nWe shall choose u X and u Y such that ¯ C is a self-orthogonal code. We denote by α the length of u X and by β the length of u Y . If ¯ C is not self-dual we may need to add more vectors to the code. In all cases we let u X and u Y be 0 if u ∈ C v and we denote by ¯ C v the extension of C v . Since C = C v , w , we denote ¯ C = ¯ C v , ¯ w .\nTheorem 2: [5] If C is a Z 2 Z 4 -additive code of type (α, β; γ, δ; κ) and v / ∈ C. Let w, C v be as before and C = C ⊥ v = C, v, w . There exists a Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code D = ¯ C, V of type (α + α , β + β ; γ , δ ; κ ), for some set of vectors V with the following conditions :\n(i) α = 0 and β = 0 only if [v, w] = 2 and [v, v] ∈ {0, 2}. (ii) α = 0 and β = 0 only if [v, w] = 2 or [v, w] ∈ {1, 3}\nand [v, v] ∈ {1, 3}. (iii) α = 0 and β = 0.\nLet C be a Z 2 Z 4 -additive code and v ∈ C. We deﬁne o C (v) = | C, v |/|C|. Note that o C (v) is not the order of v. In fact, o C (v) ∈ {2, 4} and o C (v) = 2 if and only if 2v ∈ C. Similarly, for a set of vectors V such that V ∩ C = ∅, we deﬁne o C (V ) = | C, V |/|C|. Note that, by deﬁnition, if C is a Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code, v ∈ C and w ∈ C such that C = C v , w , then\nLemma 1: [5] Let C ⊂ Z α 2 × Z β 4 be an additive self-dual code, v and w as above and C = C ⊥ v = C v , w, v . Then ¯ C is a self-orthogonal code and we can construct a set V of self-orthogonal vectors so that ¯ C, V is self-dual if and only if\nThe following generator matrices generate Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual codes for the minimum values of α and β taken from Table I.\nThe code C 1 generated by the matrix G 1 is a Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code of type (2, 2; 1, 1; 1). The code has vectors with odd weight, hence it is a Type 0 code, and therefore it is non- separable.\nThe code C 2 generated by the matrix G 2 is a Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code of type (2, 1; 2, 0; 1). The code C 2 is a separable Type I code.\nThe code C 3 generated by the matrix G 3 is a Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code of type (4, 4; 4, 1; 2).

By Table I, the possible values of α and β are α = 2 + 2a and β = 2+b, a, b ≥ 0. We shall extend the binary coordinate ﬁrst. Let v / ∈ C be such that [v, v] = 2 and we select w ∈ C\\C v such that [v, w] = 2. Deﬁne v X = (0, 1) and w X = (1, 1). By Lemma 1, o ¯ C (V ) = 1 and hence V = ∅. By using the technique described before, we can extend the code C of type (α, β; γ, δ; κ) and obtain a new Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code ¯ C which is of type (α + 2, β; γ , δ ; κ ). The new code generated is of Type 0 and therefore non-separable.\nExample 1: Take the Z 2 Z 4 -additive self-dual code C 1 gen- erated by G 1 .
