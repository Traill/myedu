Two well known strategies [1] for transmitting information over broad- cast channels are superposition coding [2], [3] and Marton over-binning using correlated auxiliary random variables [4]. In this paper, we prove that these strategies can be adapted to the quantum setting by constructing random codebooks and matching decoding measurements that have asymptotically vanishing error in the limit of many uses of the channel.\nSending classical data over a quantum channel is one of the fundamental problems of quantum information the- ory [5]. Single-letter formulas are known for classical-quantum point-to-point channels [6], [7] and multiple access channels [8]. Classical-quantum channels are a useful abstraction for studying general quantum channels and correspond to the transmitters being restricted to classical encodings. Codes for classical-quantum channels (c-q channels), when augmented with an extra optimization over the possible input states, di- rectly generalize to codes for quantum channels. Furthermore, it is known that classical encoding (coherent-state encoding using classical Gaussian codebooks) is sufﬁcient to achieve the capacity of the lossy bosonic channel, which is a realistic model for optical communication links [9].\nPrevious work on quantum broadcast channels includes [10], [11], [12]. Ref. [10] considers both classical and quantum communication over quantum broadcast channels and proves a superposition coding inner bound similar to our Theorem 1. Ref. [11] discusses classical communication over a bosonic broadcast channel, and Ref. [12] considers a Marton rate region for quantum communication.\nIn this paper, we derive two achievable rate regions for classical-quantum broadcast channels by exploiting error anal- ysis techniques developed in the context of quantum interfer- ence channels [13], [14]. In Section III, we prove achievability of the superposition coding inner bound (Theorem 1), by using a quantum simultaneous nonunique decoder at one of the receivers. Yard et al. independently proved the quantum su- perposition coding inner bound [10], but our proof is arguably\nsimpler and more in the spirit of its classical analogue [1]. In Section IV we prove that the quantum Marton rate region with no common message is achievable (Theorem 2). In the Marton coding scheme, the sub-channels to each receiver are essentially point-to-point, but it turns out that a technique that we call the \u201cprojector trick\u201d seems to be necessary in our proof. We discuss open problems and give an outlook for the future in Section V.\n1) Notation: We denote classical random variables as X, U, W , whose realizations are elements of the respective ﬁnite alphabets X , U , W. Let p X , p U , p W denote their cor- responding probability distributions. We denote quantum sys- tems as A, B, and C and their corresponding Hilbert spaces as H A , H B , and H C . We represent quantum states of a system A with a density operator ρ A , which is a positive semi-deﬁnite operator with unit trace. Let H(A) ρ ≡ −Tr ρ A log ρ A\ndenote the von Neumann entropy of the state ρ A . A classical- quantum channel, N X→B , is represented by the set of |X | possible output states {ρ B x ≡ N X→B (x)}, meaning that a classical input of x leads to a quantum output ρ B x . In a communication scenario, the decoding operations performed by the receivers correspond to quantum measurements on the outputs of the channel. A quantum measurement is a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) {Λ m } m∈{1,...,|M|} on the system B n , the output of which we denote M . To be a valid POVM, the set of |M| operators Λ m must all be positive semi- deﬁnite and sum to the identity: Λ m ≥ 0, \t m Λ m = I.\n2) Deﬁnitions: We deﬁne a classical-quantum-quantum broadcast channel as the following map:\nwhere x is a classical letter in an alphabet X and ρ B 1 B 2 x \t is a density operator on the tensor product Hilbert space for systems B 1 and B 2 . The model is such that when the sender inputs a classical letter x, Receiver 1 obtains system B 1 , and Receiver 2 obtains system B 2 . Since Receiver 1 does not have access to the B 2 part of the state ρ B 1 B 2 x , we model his state as ρ B 1 x = Tr B 2 ρ B 1 B 2 x \t , where Tr B 2 denotes the partial trace over Receiver 2\u2019s system.\n3) Information processing task: The task of communication over a broadcast channel is to use n independent instances of the channel in order to communicate with Receiver 1 at a rate R 1 and to Receiver 2 at a rate R 2 . More speciﬁcally, the sender chooses a pair of messages (m 1 , m 2 ) from message sets M i ≡ {1, 2, . . . , |M i |}, where |M i | = 2 nR i , and encodes these messages into an n-symbol codeword x n (m 1 , m 2 ) ∈ X n suitable as input for the n channel uses.\n. To decode the message m 1 intended for him, Receiver 1 performs a POVM {Λ m 1 } m\non the system B n 1 , the output of which we denote M 1 . Receiver 2 similarly performs a POVM {Γ m 2 } m\non the system B n 2 , and the random variable associated with the outcome is denoted M 2 .\nAn error occurs whenever either of the receivers decodes the message incorrectly. The probability of error for a particular message pair (m 1 , m 2 ) is\nwhere the measurement operator (I − Λ m 1 ⊗ Γ m 2 ) represents the complement of the correct decoding outcome.\nDeﬁnition 1. An (n, R 1 , R 2 , ) broadcast channel code con- sists of a codebook {x n (m 1 , m 2 )} m 1 ∈M 1 ,m 2 ∈M 2 and two decoding POVMs {Λ m 1 } m 1 ∈M 1 and {Γ m 2 } m 2 ∈M 2 such that the average probability of error p e is bounded from above as\nA rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) is achievable if there exists an (n, R 1 − δ, R 2 − δ, ) quantum broadcast channel code for all\nWhen devising coding strategies for c-q channels, the main obstacle to overcome is the construction of a decoding POVM that correctly decodes the messages. Given a set of positive operators {Π m } which are suitable for detecting each message, we can construct a POVM by normalizing them using the square-root measurement [6], [7]:\nThus, the search for a decoding POVM is reduced to the prob- lem of ﬁnding positive operators Π m apt at detecting and dis- tinguishing the output states produced by each of the possible input messages (Tr[Π m ρ m ] ≥ 1 − and Tr[Π m ρ m =m ] ≤ ).\nOne possible strategy for the broadcast channel is to send a message at a rate that is low enough so that both receivers are able to decode. Furthermore, if we assume that Receiver 1 has a better reception signal, then the sender can encode a further message superimposed on top of the common message that Receiver 1 will be able to decode given the common message. The sender encodes the common message at rate R 2 using a codebook generated from a probability distribution p W (w), and the additional message for Receiver 1 at rate R 1 using a conditional codebook with distribution p X|W (x|w).\nTheorem 1 (Superposition coding inner bound). A rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) is achievable for the quantum broadcast channel in (1) if it satisﬁes the following inequalities:\nR 1 ≤ I(X; B 1 |W ) θ , \t (5) R 2 ≤ I(W ; B 2 ) θ , \t (6)\nwhere the above information quantities are with respect to a state θ W XB 1 B 2 of the form\nProof: The new idea in the proof is to exploit superposi- tion encoding and a quantum simultaneous nonunique decoder for the decoding of the ﬁrst receiver [2], [3] instead of the quantum successive decoding used in [10]. We use a standard HSW decoder for the second receiver [6], [7].\nCodebook generation. We generate randomly and indepen- dently M 2 codewords w n (m 2 ) according to the product distri- bution p W n (w n ) ≡\np W (w i ). For each codeword w n (m 2 ), we randomly and conditionally independently generates M 1 codewords x n (m 1 , m 2 ) according to the product distribution: p X n |W n (x n |w n (m 2 )) ≡\np X|W (x i |w i (m 2 )). The sender then transmits the codeword x n (m 1 , m 2 ) if she wishes to send (m 1 , m 2 ).\nPOVM Construction. We now describe the POVMs that the receivers employ in order to decode the transmitted mes- sages. First consider the state we obtain from (8) by tracing over the B 2 system:\nwhere σ B 1 w ≡ x p X|W (x|w) ρ B 1 x . For the ﬁrst receiver, we exploit a square-root decoding POVM as in (4) based on the following positive operators:\nThe above projectors are weakly typical projectors [5, Section 14.2.1] deﬁned with respect to the states ρ ⊗n , σ B n 1 W n (m\nConsider now the state in (8) as it looks from the point of view of Receiver 2. If we trace over the X and B 1 systems, we obtain the following state:\nwhere σ B 2 w ≡ x p X|W (x|w) ρ B 2 x . For the second receiver, we exploit a standard HSW decoding POVM that is with respect to the above state\u2014it is a square-root measurement as in (4), based on the following positive operators:\nwhere the above projectors are weakly typical projectors deﬁned with respect to ρ ⊗n and σ B n 2 W n (m\nError analysis. We now analyze the expectation of the average error probability for the ﬁrst receiver with the POVM deﬁned by (4) and (9):\nDue to the above exchange between the expectation and the average and the symmetry of the code construction (each codeword is selected randomly and independently), it sufﬁces to analyze the expectation of the average error probability for the ﬁrst message pair (m 1 = 1, m 2 = 1), i.e., the last line above is equal to E Xn,Wn Tr I − Γ B n 1 1,1 ρ B 1 X n (1,1) . Using the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality (Lemma 3 in the appendix of Ref. [15]), we obtain the following upper bound on this term:\nWe begin by bounding the term in the ﬁrst line above. Consider the following chain of inequalities:\nwhich holds for all ρ, σ, and Λ such that 0 ≤ ρ, σ, Λ ≤ I. The second inequality follows from the Gentle Operator Lemma for ensembles (see Lemma 2 in the appendix of Ref. [15]) and the properties of typical projectors for sufﬁciently large n.\nWe now focus on bounding the term in the second line of (11). We can expand this term as follows:\nwhere we deﬁne K ≡ 2 n[H(B 1 |W X)+δ] . The ﬁrst inequality is due to the projector trick inequality [16], [14], [13] which states that\nThe equality I(W X; B 1 ) = I(X; B 1 ) follows from the way the codebook is constructed (i.e., the Markov chain W − X − B), as discussed also in [14]. This completes the error analysis for the ﬁrst receiver.\nThe proof for the second receiver is analogous to the point- to-point HSW theorem. The appendix of Ref. [15] gives the details for this and ties the coding theorem together so that the sender and two receivers can agree on a strategy that has asymptotically vanishing error probability in the large n limit.\nWe now prove that the Marton inner bound is achievable for quantum broadcast channels. The Marton scheme depends on auxiliary random variables U 1 and U 2 , binning, and the properties of strongly typical sequences and projectors.\nTheorem 2 (Marton inner bound). Let {ρ B 1 B 2 x } be a classical- quantum broadcast channel and x = f (u 1 , u 2 ) be a determin- istic function. The following rate region is achievable:\nR 2 ≤ I(U 2 ; B 2 ) θ , \t (15) R 1 + R 2 ≤ I(U 1 ; B 1 ) θ + I(U 2 ; B 2 ) θ − I(U 1 ; U 2 ) θ ,\nProof: Consider the classical-quantum broadcast channel {N (x) ≡ ρ B 1 B 2 x }, and a deterministic mixing function: f : U 1 × U 2 → X . Using the mixing function as a pre-coder to the broadcast channel N , we obtain a channel N deﬁned as:\n≡ ρ B 1 B 2 u 1 ,u 2 . \t (16) Codebook construction. Deﬁne two auxiliary indices 1 ∈\nL 2 = 2 n[I(U 2 ;B 2 )−δ] . For each 1 generate an i.i.d. random sequence u n 1 ( 1 ) according to p U n 1 (u n 1 ). Similarly we choose L 2 random i.i.d. sequences u n 2 ( 2 ) according to p U n\n(u n 2 ). Partition the sequences u n 1 ( 1 ) into 2 nR 1 different bins B m 1 . Similarly, partition the sequences u n 2 ( 2 ) into 2 nR 2 bins C m 2 . For each message pair (m 1 , m 2 ), the sender selects a sequence\n, such that each sequence is taken from the appropriate bin and the sender de- mands that they are strongly jointly-typical (otherwise declar- ing failure). The codebook x n (m 1 , m 2 ) is deterministically constructed from u n 1 ( 1 ), u n 2 ( 2 ) by applying the function x i = f (u 1i , u 2i ).\nTransmission. Let ( 1 , 2 ) denote the pair of indices of the joint sequence (u n 1 ( 1 ), u n 2 ( 2 )) which was chosen as the\ncodeword for message (m 1 , m 2 ). Expressed in terms of these indices the output of the channel is\nDecoding. The detection POVM for Receiver 1, {Λ 1 }\n, is constructed by using the square-root measurement as in (4) based on the following combination of strongly typical projectors:\n¯ ρ,δ . \t (19) The projectors Π u n\nare deﬁned with respect to the states ω u n\n⊗n given in (18). Note that we use strongly typical projectors in this case [5, Section 14.2.3]. Knowing 1 and the binning scheme, Receiver 1 can deduce the message m 1 from the bin index. Receiver 2 uses a similar decoding strategy to obtain 2 and infer m 2 .\nError analysis. An error occurs if one (or more) of the following error events occurs.\nE 0 : An encoding error occurs whenever there is no jointly typical sequence in B m 1 × C m 2 for some message pair (m 1 , m 2 ).\nE 1 : A decoding error occurs at Receiver 1 if L 1 = 1 . E 2 : A decoding error occurs at Receiver 2 if L 2 = 2 .\nThe probability of an encoding error E 0 is bounded like in the classical Marton scheme [4], [1], [17]. To see this, we use Cover\u2019s counting argument [17]. The probability that two random sequences u n 1 , u n 2 chosen according to the marginals are jointly typical is 2 −nI(U 1 ;U 2 ) and since there are on average\nthe expected number of jointly-typical sequences that can be constructed from each combination of bins is\nThus, if we choose R 1 + R 2 + δ ≤ I(U 1 ; B 1 ) + I(U 2 ; B 2 ) − I(U 1 ; U 2 ), then the expected number of strongly jointly-typical sequences in B m 1 × C m 2 is much larger than one.\nTo bound the probability of error event E 1 , we use the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality (Lemma 3 in the ap- pendix of Ref. [15]):\nLemma 1. The state ρ 1 , 2 is well supported by both the averaged state projector: Tr Π n ¯ ρ,δ ρ 1 , 2 ≥ 1− , ∀ 1 , 2 , and the ω B 1 u 1 conditionally typical projector: Tr Π u n\nwhere the inequalities follow from (12) and Lemma 1. This use of Lemma 1 demonstrates why the Marton coding scheme selects the sequences u n 1 ( 1 ) and u n 2 ( 2 ) such that they are strongly jointly typical.\nTo bound the second term, we begin by applying a variant of the projector trick from (14). In the below, note that the expectation E U 1 ,U 2 over the random code is with respect to the product distribution p U n\n \n \n \n \nWe continue the proof using averaging over the choice of codebook and the properties of typical projectors:\nTherefore, if we choose 2 nR 1 = L 1 ≤ 2 n[I(U 1 ;B 1 )−3δ] , the probability of error will go to zero in the asymptotic limit of many channel uses. The analysis of the event E 2 is similar.\nWe have proved quantum generalizations of the superposi- tion coding inner bound [2], [3] and the Marton rate region with no common message [4]. The key ingredient in both proofs was the use of the projector trick. A natural followup question would be to combine the two strategies to obtain the Marton coding scheme with a common message.\nA much broader goal would be to extend all of network information theory to the study of quantum channels. To accomplish this goal, it would be helpful to have a powerful\ntool that generalizes El Gamal and Kim\u2019s classical packing lemma [1] to the quantum domain. The packing lemma is sufﬁcient to prove all of the known coding theorems in network information theory. At the moment, it is not clear to us whether such a tool exists for the quantum case, but evidence in favor of its existence is that 1) one can prove the HSW coding theorem by using conditionally typical projectors only [5, Exercise 19.3.5], 2) we have solved the quantum simultaneous decoding conjecture for the case of two senders [13], [14], and 3) we have generalized two important coding theorems in the current paper (with proofs somewhat similar to the classical proofs). Ideally, such a tool would allow quantum information theorists to prove quantum network coding theo- rems by appealing to it, rather than having to analyze each coding scheme in detail on a case by case basis.\nWe acknowledge discussions with Patrick Hayden, Omar Fawzi, Pranab Sen, and Saikat Guha during the development of [13], [14].
