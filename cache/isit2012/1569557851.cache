Optimality of the separate source-channel coding has been investigated in several works [2]-[5]. On the other hand, suboptimality of the separation has been shown for some multi-user systems [6], [7]. Reliable transmission of correlated sources over Multiple Access Channels (MACs) is considered in [7]. It is shown by an example [7] that simply comparing Slepian-Wolf region [8] with the capacity region of the underlying MAC does not necessarily reveal the possibility or impossibility of reliable transmission. In [4], the general source coding problem is redeﬁned. The problem which is considered instead is to determine whether the sources can be transmitted to their destinations for a given number of channel uses per source sample (cupss), which is deﬁned to be the source-channel rate of the joint source-channel code.\nThe correlation preserving technique of [7] is utilized to obtain sufﬁcient conditions for the reliable transmission of correlated sources over Broadcast Channels (BCs) [9], Inter- ference Channels (ICs) [10] and relay channels [11], [12]. Tuncel [13] established the optimal source-channel rate for the transmission of a single source over multireceiver BCs with\ncorrelated side information at each receiver. A relay channel with correlated sources was studied in some works [3], [14], [15], [16]. Gunduz and Erkip [3] investigated the reliable transmission of a single source over the relay channel with correlated side information at the relay and the receiver. The coding technique of [3] is based on source-channel separation, where the Decode-and-Forward (DF) strategy [17] is employed as the achievability scheme. Separation has been utilized for the relay channel with arbitrarily correlated sources in [14]. In [14], the block Markov coding and irregular decoding strategy [17] was used to ﬁnd the explicit conditions under which the sources can be reliably transmitted to the receiver. Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the reliable transmission of cor- related sources over linear deterministic relay networks have been characterized in [15]. Multicasting a set of correlated sources over cooperative relay networks was studied in [18].\nIn this paper, we study the reliable transmission of cor- related sources (S 1 , S 2 ) over the relay channel for a given source-channel rate of the joint source-channel code (Fig. 1). Sources S 1 and S 2 are available at the sender and the relay, respectively. The destination wishes to reconstruct both sources. We ﬁnd necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the achievability of a given source-channel rate, using separate source-channel codes. The coding technique uses Slepian-Wolf source coding [8] followed by the Partial Decode-and-Forward (PDF) strategy [17] as the achievability scheme. In the PDF strategy, the relay partially decodes the message transmitted from the sender. We also consider the semi-deterministic relay channel where the output at the relay is a deterministic func- tion of inputs from the sender and the relay. We show that for the transmission of a single source over the semi-deterministic relay channel with correlated side information at the relay, the proposed conditions coincide, yielding a characterization. We also obtain necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the transmission of sources over the degraded relay channel where the output at the receiver is a degraded version of the output at the relay.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we present a mathematical framework for our work. In Section III, we ﬁnd necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the achievability of a given source-channel rate, also we discuss source trans- mission over the semi-deterministic relay channel with side information at the relay. Conclusions are provided in Section\nWe denote discrete random variables with capital letters e.g., X, Y , and their realizations with lower case letters x, y. X j i\nindicates a sequence of random variables (X i , ..., X j ). We use H(.) to denote the entropy of a discrete random variable and I(.; .) to denote the mutual information between two discrete random variables. We denote by A n ε (X, Y ), the set of ε- strongly jointly typical sequences of length n, on p(x, y). A random variable X takes values in a set X . Finally, we denote the probability mass function of X over X with p(x) and the conditional probability mass function of X given Y by p(x|y).\nDeﬁnition 1: For the lossless transmission of the source pair (s m 1 , s m 2 ) over the discrete memoryless relay channel (Fig. 1) deﬁned by p(y, y r |x, x r ), a length n joint source channel code consists of an encoder mapping,\nDeﬁnition 2: We say that the source-channel rate κ is achievable if there exists a sequence of encoders f (m,n) , g (m,n) and decoder h (m,n) with κ = n/m such that P (m,n) e \t → 0 as m, n → ∞.\nRemark 1: For the lossless transmission of the source s n 1 over the relay channel with correlated side information s n 2 at the relay, the mapping at the decoder is deﬁned as\nIn this section, we ﬁrst ﬁnd necessary and sufﬁcient con- ditions for the achievability of a source-channel rate κ. Then, we discuss a special case where the conditions coincide. The following theorem provides sufﬁcient conditions for the transmission of sources over a relay channel.\nTheorem 1: Consider the transmission of correlated sources S 1 and S 2 over a relay channel. The source-channel rate κ is achievable if there exist auxiliary random variables V and V r with joint distribution of all variables factoring as p(v, v r )p(x r |v r )p(x|v, v r ) such that\nH(S 1 |S 2 ) ≤κ[I(X; Y |V, V r , X r ) + I(V ; Y r |V r , X r )] H(S 2 |S 1 ) ≤κI(Y ; X r |V, V r , X)\nProof: The proof of Theorem 1 can be obtained from the correlation-preserving method of [11], [12]. Here, we constrain the channel inputs to be independent of source distributions. We provide the proof of achievability to illustrate the separa- tion scheme that is used. We use Slepian-Wolf source coding followed by the PDF strategy as the achievability scheme. Consider a rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying the following:\nH(S 1 |S 2 ) < R 1 < κ[I(X; Y |V, V r , X r ) + I(V ; Y r |V r , X r )] H(S 2 |S 1 ) < R 2 < κI(Y ; X r |V, V r , X)\nH(S 1 , S 2 ) < R 1 + R 2 < κ[I(Y ; X, X r |V, V r ) + I(V ; Y r |V r , X r )] H(S 1 , S 2 ) < R 1 + R 2 < κI(X, X r ; Y ).\nAlso, choose the rate R 0 such that 0 ≤ R 0 ≤ R 1 . (a) Random partitioning :\nbins and denote the bin index for a given s m 1 by j(s m 1 ) ∈ {1, ..., 2 mR 1 }.\n\u2022 Randomly partition the source sequence s m 2 into 2 mR 2 bins and denote the bin index for a given s m 2 by l(s m 2 ) ∈ {1, ..., 2 mR 2 }.\n\u2022 For each v n r (q), generate 2 mR 0 sequences v n (t, q) ac- cording to n i =1 p(v i |v r,i (q)), t ∈ [1 : 2 mR 0 ].\n(q), v n (t, q)), generate 2 m (R 1 −R 0 ) se- quences x n (j , t, q) according to\n(q), generate 2 mR 2 sequences x n r (l, q) ac- cording to n i =1 p(x r,i |v r,i (q)), l ∈ [1 : 2 mR 2 ].\nWe use separate source and channel codes for encoding. A total of Bm source samples are transmitted over a total of (B + 1)n channel uses. For any (n, m), deﬁne κ = n/m. Consider a source sequence s Bm 1 of length Bm. Partition this sequence into B portions, s m 1,b , b = 1, ..., B. Similarly, partition the source sequence s Bm 2 of length Bm into B portions, s m 2,b , b = 1, ..., B. In the ﬁrst block, the transmitter observes s m 1,1 and ﬁnds its bin index j 1 (s m 1,1 ) . It then splits j 1 (s m 1,1 ) into two parts t 1 and j 1 with rates R 0 and (R 1 − R 0 ), respectively. The transmitter sends x n (1, t 1 , 1). The relay also observes s m 2,1 and ﬁnds its bin index l 1 (s m 2,1 ). It then sends x n r (1, 1). In block b, the relay knows t b−1 from block b − 1. It then sends x n r (l b−1 , q b ), where q b = t b−1 and l b−1 is the bin index of s m 2,b−1 . The transmitter sends x n (j b−1 , t b , q b ), where j b−1 is the bin index of s m 1,b−1 and j b−1 = (j b−1 , t b−1 ). In block B + 1, the transmitter and the relay send x n (j B , 1, t B ) and x n r (l B , t B ), respectively.\nAt relay : The relay knowing q b ﬁnds t b such that (x n r (l b−1 , q b ), v n (t b , q b ), v n r (q b ), y r (b)) ∈ A n . This can be done with an arbitrarily small probability of error if:\nBackward decoding at the receiver : The receiver begins decoding after receiving the last block. Assume that t b has been decoded accurately from block b + 1. For block b, the receiver declares that (l b−1 , j b−1 , t b−1 ) is sent if (x n (j b−1 , t b , q b ), x n r (l b−1 , q b ), v n (t b , q b ), v n r (q b ), y(b)) ∈ A n . This can be done with an arbitrarily small probability of error if\n(R 1 − R 0 ) + R 2 + R 0 ≤ κI(X, X r ; Y ) \t (3) (R 1 − R 0 ) + R 2 ≤ κI(X, X r ; Y |V, V r ) \t (4)\nR 1 − R 0 ≤ κI(X; Y |V, V r , X r ) \t (5) R 2 ≤ κI(X r ; Y |V, V r , X). (6)\nThese indices are provided to the source decoder, where j b−1 = (j b−1 , t b−1 ). The source decoder then ﬁnds s m 1,b−1 and\n(s m 1,b−1 , s m 2,b−1 ) ∈ A n . From Slepian-Wolf source coding [8], we have\nH(S 1 |S 2 ) ≤ R 1 \t (7) H(S 2 |S 1 ) ≤ R 2 \t (8) H(S 1 , S 2 ) ≤ R 1 + R 2 . \t (9)\nRemark 2: If there is no source sequence available at the relay, i.e., let S 2 = 0, S 1 = S, V r = X r , p(s, v, x, x r ) = p(s)p(v, x, x r ) and H(S) = R in the conditions of (1), then we obtain the following achievable rate for the relay channel:\n(10) for the joint distribution p(v, x r , x). The achievable rate of (10) was obtained for the relay channel in [17] using the PDF strategy.\nCorollary 1: If the relay completely decodes the message sent from the transmitter, i.e., let V = X in the conditions of (1), then we obtain the following conditions for the transmis- sion of (S 1 , S 2 ) over the relay channel with source-channel rate κ,\nH(S 1 |S 2 ) ≤ κI(X; Y r |V r , X r ), \t (11) H(S 2 |S 1 ) ≤ κI(X r ; Y |V r , X), \t (12) H(S 1 , S 2 ) ≤ κI(X, X r ; Y ), \t (13)\nwhere the joint distribution of all variables can be factored as p(s 1 , s 2 , x, x r , v r ) = p(s 1 , s 2 )p(v r )p(x|v r )p(x r |v r ). (14) Corollary 2: The following conditions can be obtained for\nthe reliable transmission of the single source S 1 with corre- lated side information S 2 at the relay and source-channel rate κ,\nH(S 1 |S 2 ) ≤κ[I(X; Y |V, V r , X r ) + I(V ; Y r |V r , X r )] (15) H(S 1 ) ≤κI(X, X r ; Y ), \t (16)\nfor all joint distributions of the form p(v, v r )p(x r |v r )p(x|v, v r ). The conditions in (15)-(16) are special cases of (1) when S 2 is not decoded at the receiver.\nThe following theorem provides necessary conditions for the achievability of a source-channel rate κ.\nTheorem 2: In a lossless transmission of correlated sources (S 1 , S 2 ) over a relay channel, if the source-channel rate κ is achievable then\nH(S 1 |S 2 ) ≤ κI(X; Y, Y r |X r ) \t (17) H(S 2 |S 1 ) ≤ κI(X r ; Y |X) \t (18) H(S 1 , S 2 ) ≤ κI(X, X r ; Y ) \t (19)\nwhere (a) follows from Fano\u2019s inequality. (b) follows from the data processing inequality. (c) follows from the chain rule. (d) follows because X r,i is a function of (S m 2 , Y i−1 r ). (e) follows because conditioning does not increase entropy. (f ) follows because (X i−1 , X n i +1 , S m 2 , Y i−1 , Y i−1 r ) → (X i , X r,i ) → (Y i , Y r,i ) form a Markov chain. We also have\nwhere (a) follows from Fano\u2019s inequality. (b) follows from the data processing inequality. (c) follows from the chain rule. (d) follows because X n is a function of S m 1 . (e) follows because\nwhere (a) follows from Fano\u2019s inequality. (b) follows from the data processing inequality. (c) follows from the chain rule. (d) follows because (X i−1 , X n i +1 , Y i−1 , X i−1 r , X n r,i +1 ) → (X i , X r,i ) → Y i form a Markov chain. From convexity arguments and letting m, n → ∞, we obtain the conditions in (17)-(19).\nNow, we discuss the reliable transmission of the source pair (S 1 , S 2 ) over the degraded relay channel where the channel is characterized by p(y, y r |x, x r ) = p(y|y r , x r )p(y r |x, x r ). We use the sufﬁcient conditions of Corollary 1 for this case. The following necessary conditions can be obtained as a special case of Theorem 2.\nCorollary 3: In a lossless transmission of correlated sources (S 1 , S 2 ) over a degraded relay channel, if the source-channel rate κ is achievable then\nH(S 1 |S 2 ) ≤ κI(X; Y r |X r ) \t (21) H(S 2 |S 1 ) ≤ κI(X r ; Y |X) \t (22) H(S 1 , S 2 ) ≤ κI(X, X r ; Y ) \t (23)\nfor some joint distribution of the form p(s 1 , s 2 , x, x r , y, y r ) = p(s 1 , s 2 )p(x, x r )p(y, y r |x, x r ).\nRemark 3: The available source correlation does not help in creating correlated channel inputs, as Theorem 2 already optimizes over all possible joint channel input distributions. However, this bound is not tight in general, since, in reality not all joint distributions can be achieved.\nRemark 4: Consider the transmission of the source S 1 over a degraded relay channel with correlated side information S 2 at the relay. It is shown in [3] that the source-channel rate κ is achievable if and only if\nH(S 1 |S 2 ) ≤ κI(X; Y r |X r ) \t (24) H(S 1 ) ≤ κI(X, X r ; Y ) \t (25)\nfor some joint distribution p(s 1 , s 2 )p(x, x r )p(y, y r |x, x r ). The conditions (24)-(25) are special cases of the proposed neces-\nsary and sufﬁcient conditions. To show this, set V r = X r in (15)-(16). The lower bound follows from Corollary 3 and considering the fact that given (Y r , X r ), Y is independent of X.\nWe show that Theorems 1 and 2 coincide for a special case. Consider the semi-deterministic relay channel where Y r is a deterministic function of (X, X r ), i.e., Y r = f (X, X r ).\nTheorem 3: Consider the transmission of a source S 1 over a semi-deterministic relay channel with side information S 2 at the relay. Then, the source-channel rate κ is achievable if and only if\nH(S 1 |S 2 ) ≤ κ[I(X; Y |Y r , X r ) + H(Y r |X r )] (26) H(S 1 ) ≤ κI(X, X r ; Y ) \t (27)\nProof: For achievability, set V = Y r and V r = X r in (15)-(16). The proof of converse easily follows from Theorem 2 and considering the fact that Y r = f (X, X r ).\nWe investigated the reliable transmission of correlated sources over the relay channel. We found necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the achievability of the source-channel rate κ. The coding scheme uses Slepian-Wolf source coding followed by the PDF strategy. We also considered the semi- deterministic relay channel. It is shown that for the source transmission over the semi-deterministic relay channel with correlated side information at the relay, the proposed bounds coincide. We also found necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the reliable transmission of correlated sources over the degraded relay channel."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"T. M. Cover"},{"name":"J. A.
