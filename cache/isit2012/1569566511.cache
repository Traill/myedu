Approximate capacity results have been proved for the 2-user interference channel [1], many-to-one or one-to- many interference channel [2], and two-way channel [3], which characterize the capacity within a constant number of bits/sec/Hz independent of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel parameters. It has also been proved in [4] that inter- ference alignment can achieve the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF) of the time-varying K-user interference channel. The recently proposed ergodic interference aliment in [5] makes interference aligned at ﬁnite SNR.\nFor multi-source multi-hop networks, interference can be cancelled by aligning multiple paths through the network, a technique termed as interference neutralization. Proper use of such interference neutralization is the key for an approximate capacity [6] or DoF characterization [7]\u2013[11] of multi-source multi-hop networks. In spite of recent progress in this area, the best known capacity characterization for fully connected 2-user 2-hop networks is within o(log(SNR)) bits/sec/Hz [8], which can be arbitrarily large as SNR increases.\nThe aim of this paper is to close the capacity gap of the 2- user 2-hop networks within a constant number of bits/sec/Hz, independent of SNR and the number of relays. Our achievabil- ity is based on ergodic interference neutralization [9], [12],\nwhich is similar to ergodic interference alignment [5], [13] applied for multi-source single-hop networks. Our previous work [12] considered 2-user 2-hop networks assuming that the number of relays L is equal to 2 and characterized the ergodic sum capacity within 4 bits/sec/Hz for independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform phase fading and approximately 4.7 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading. As the number of relays L increases, the ergodic sum capacity increases approximately as 2 log L and we can narrow the corresponding gap in our analysis. We show that in the limits of large L this gap is given by 4((log π) − 1) \t 2.6 for i.i.d. uniform phase fading and 4(4 − log 3π) 3.1 for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading.\nThroughout the paper, we will use A, a, and A to denote a matrix, vector, and set, respectively. Let A T (or a T ) and A \u2020 (or a \u2020 ) denote the transpose and conjugate transpose of A (or a), respectively. Denote I and N C (µ, σ 2 ) by the identity matrix and the circularly symmetric complex Gaussian distribution with mean µ and variance σ 2 , respectively.\nWe study a 2-user 2-hop network with 2K relays depicted in Fig. 1 where each source wishes to transmit an independent message to its destination. The input\u2013output relation of the ﬁrst hop at time t is given by\nwhere y R [t] = [y R,1 [t], · · · , y R,2K [t]] T is the received signal vector of the relays at time t, H[t] is the 2K × 2 dimensional\ncomplex channel matrix of the ﬁrst hop at time t, x[t] = [x 1 [t], x 2 [t]] T is the transmit signal vector of the sources at time t, and z R [t] = [z R,1 [t], · · · , z R,2K [t]] T is the noise vector of the relays at time t. Similarly, the input\u2013output relation of the second hop at time t is given by\nwhere y[t] = [y 1 [t], y 2 [t]] T is the received signal vector of the destinations at time t, G[t] is the 2 × 2K dimen- sional complex channel matrix of the second hop at time t, x R [t] = [x R,1 [t], · · · , x R,2K [t]] T is the transmit signal vector of the relays at time t, and z[t] = [z 1 [t], z 2 [t]] T is the noise vector of the destinations at time t. Let H k [t] = [[h 2k −1,1 [t], h 2k −1,2 [t]] T , [h 2k,1 [t], h 2k,2 [t]] T ] T denote the 2 × 2 dimensional channel matrix at time t from the sources to relays 2k − 1 and 2k, where h i,j [t] is the (i, j)th element of H[t]. Then H[t] = [H 1 [t] T , · · · , H K [t] T ] T . Similarly, denote G k [t] = [[g 1,2k −1 [t], g 1,2k [t]] T , [g 2,2k −1 [t], g 2,2k [t]] T ] T and G[t] = [G 1 [t], · · · , G K [t]], where g j,i [t] denote the (j, i)th element of G[t]. Each source and relay should satisfy the average power constraint P and the elements of z R [t] and z[t] are i.i.d. drawn from N C (0, 1).\nWe assume that channel coefﬁcients are i.i.d. drawn from a continuous distribution f (x), x ∈ C, and vary independently and identically over time . Without loss of generality, we assume that E [ |h i,j [t] | 2 ] = 1 and E[ |g j,i [t] | 2 ] = 1 for all i ∈ {1, · · · , 2K} and j ∈ {1, 2}. We further assume that the sources do not know any channel state information (CSI) and the relays and the destinations know global CSI. That is, at time t, each relay and destination knows H[t] and G[t].\nBased on the network model, we consider a set of length- n block codes. Let W i be the message of source i uniformly distributed over {1, · · · , 2 nR i }, where R i is the rate of source i. A rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) is said to be achievable if there exists a sequence of (2 nR 1 , 2 nR 2 , n) codes such that the probabilities of error for W 1 and W 2 converge to zero as n increases. The sum capacity C sum is deﬁned as the maximum achievable sum rate. In the rest of the paper, we will characterize an approximate capacity on C sum for a broad class of channel distributions including Rayleigh fading.\nIn this section, we ﬁrst introduce our main results and explain the proposed ergodic interference neutralization in the next section.\n \n \n \n \nis achievable for i ∈ {1, 2}, where the expectation is over the channel coefﬁcients. 1 Here γ = \t P 1+2P and a ki =\nRemark 1: Theorem 1 generalizes our previous result in [12], which corresponds to the case where K = 1. Therefore the proposed ergodic interference neutralization characterizes C sum within 4 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. uniform phase fading and approximately 4.7 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading when K = 1. We refer to [12] and also the full paper [14] in preparation for the proof.\nFor convenience, let R IN denote the achievable sum rate of Theorem 1. Since channel coefﬁcients are i.i.d., C sum is upper bounded by the ergodic capacity of the multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) channel from the sources to the relays, that is\nExample 1 (Sum rate: Rayleigh fading): Figure 2 plots R MIMO and R IN for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading, i.e., f (x) follows N C (0, 1). As shown in the ﬁgure, R MIMO − R IN decreases as K increases. Apparently the proposed ergodic interference neutralization can narrow the gap from C sum as the number of relays increases.\nIn this subsection, we consider a class of channel distribu- tions such that f (x) is only a function of its magnitude |x|. That is, for a given channel amplitude, its phase is uniformly distributed over [0, 2π) independent of the channel amplitude. We derive an upper bound on the gap between the ergodic sum capacity and the achievable lower bound in Theorem 1 in the limit of large K.\nIn the following theorem, we ﬁrst characterize the sum capacity gap for i.i.d. uniform phase fading.\nTheorem 2: Consider the fading 2 × 2K × 2 network. If h i,j [t] = exp(θ i,j [t]), g j,i [t] = exp(ϕ j,i [t]), and θ i,j [t] and ϕ j,i [t] are uniformly distributed over [0, 2π) for all i ∈ {1, · · · , 2K} and j ∈ {1, 2}, then\nFigure 3 plots the gap R MIMO − R IN for i.i.d. uniform phase fading with respect to K. As shown in the ﬁgure, the gaps decrease as K increases and eventually converge to 4((log π) − 1) regardless of P , which was proved in Theorem 2. Therefore the proposed ergodic interference alignment characterizes C sum within 4((log π) − 1) bits/sec/Hz in the limit of large K. Compared to 4 bits/sec/Hz, the sum capacity gap when K = 1 (Remark 1), the sum capacity gap can be tightened as K increases.\nIn the following theorem, we characterize the sum capacity gap assuming that f (x) is only a function of |x|. The presented gap only depends on the channel amplitude distribution and does not depend on the transmit power constraint P .\nTheorem 3: Consider the fading 2 × 2K × 2 network. If f (x) is only a function of |x|, then\nExample 3 (Gap as K → ∞: Rayleigh fading): Figure 3 plots R MIMO − R IN for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading with respect to K. That is, f (x) follows N C (0, 1). It can be shown that E [ | det(H 1 ) |] = 3π/8 for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading and thus the theoretical limit in Theorem 3 is 4(4 − log 3π) \t 3.1. As shown in the ﬁgure, R MIMO − R IN quickly converges to the theoretical limit as K increases. Considering that the sum capacity gap is approximately given by 4.7 bits/sec/Hz when K = 1 (Remark 1), the sum capacity gap can be tightened as K increases.\nRemark 2: The same bounds in Theorems 2 and 3 hold for a general number of relays L. We can simply use 2 L/2\nrelays and apply the proposed ergodic interference neutraliza- tion, which gives the same bounds in the limit of large L, where x = max {a ∈ Z|a ≤ x}.\nIn this section, we propose ergodic interference neutraliza- tion for fading 2 × 2K × 2 networks.\nAs pointed out in [9], [12], a simple amplify-and-forward with an appropriate delay τ is enough to neutralize interference at both destinations if G[t + τ ]H[t] approximately becomes a diagonal matrix with non-zero diagonal elements. In this paper, we impose a block-wise interference neutralization condition such that G k [t + τ ]H k [t] approximately becomes a diagonal matrix for all k ∈ {1, · · · , K}. Then for each block k we apply the same channel pairing proposed in [14]. Speciﬁcally, for A = [[a 1,1 , a 1,2 ] T , [a 2,1 , a 2,2 ] T ] T ∈ C 2 ×2 , deﬁne\nThe relays amplify and forward y R [t] with appropriate delay τ if G k [t + τ ] is approximately given by F 2 (H k [t]) for all k. For relaying, the ﬁrst and the second relays in the kth block (relays 2k − 1 and 2k, respectively) amplify and forward with the ampliﬁcation coefﬁcients γ det(H k [t]) ∗ | det(H\n, respectively. Hence this scheme guarantees that the effective channel matrix of the kth block is approximately given by\nwhich provides the overall effective channel matrix from the sources to the destinations as ( K k=1 γ | det(H k [t]) |)I. Here, γ = \t P 1+2P is the power ampliﬁcation factor to satisfy the average power constraint P and det(H k [t]) ∗ | det(H\nis needed to compensate the phase of the kth effective channel matrix guaranteeing coherent combining gain over the blocks. As a result, the overall channel gain γ 2 ( K k=1 | det(H k [t]) |) 2 appears in the numerator of Theorem 1. The term γ 2 K k=1 a ki in the denominator of Theorem 1 is the additional noise due to amplify-and-forward relaying. Lastly, since the probability distributions for [H 1 [t] T , · · · , H K [t] T ] T at the ﬁrst hop and [F (H 1 [t]), · · · , F (H K [t])] at the second hop are the same, we can utilize almost all channel instances, which provides Theorem 1.\nAlthough ﬁnding a pair of channel instances having exact prescribed values is impossible, such a pairing can be done approximately by partitioning the channel space of each hop. In the following two subsections, we ﬁrst explain channel space partition and pairing and then explain the detailed proposed scheme.\nWe partition the channel space of each hop, i.e, C 2K ×2 space for the ﬁrst hop and C 2 ×2K space for the second hop. For M ∈ Z + and ∆ > 0, deﬁne Q 1 = A ∈ ∆(Z 2K ×2 + Z 2K ×2 ) |re(a i,j ) | ≤ ∆M, |im(a i,j ) | ≤ ∆M for all i ∈ {1, · · · , 2K} and j ∈ {1, 2} , where a i,j denotes the (i, j)th element of A and re( ·) and im(·) denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. Here, M and ∆ are related to the number of quantization points and the quantization interval. For a quantized channel matrix Q ∈ Q 1 , deﬁne A 1 (Q) =\nA ∈ C 2K ×2 − ∆ 2 ≤ re(a i,j ) − re(q i,j ) < ∆ 2 and − ∆ 2 ≤ im (a i,j ) − im(q i,j ) < ∆ 2 for all i ∈ {1, · · · , 2K} and j ∈ {1, 2} , where a i,j and q i,j denote the (i, j)th element of A and Q, respectively. We will use A 1 (Q) for partitioning the ﬁrst-hop channel space. Similarly, we can deﬁne Q 2 and A 2 (Q) for the second hop.\nNow consider the channel space pairing. For A ∈ C 2K ×2 , deﬁne F (A) = [F 2 [A 1 ], F 2 [A 2 ], · · · , F 2 [A K ]], where A =\n[A T 1 , A T 2 , · · · , A T K ] T and the deﬁnition of F 2 ( ·) is given by (4). Note that F (Q) ∈ Q 2 for any Q ∈ Q 1 . The relays will choose a certain time t 2 and amplify and forward y R [t 1 ] such that H[t 1 ] ∈ A 1 (Q) and G[t 2 ] ∈ A 2 (F (Q)). Hence the channel subspace A 1 (Q) of the ﬁrst hop will be paired with the channel subspace A 2 (F (Q)) of the second hop.\nBased on the channel space partition and pairing rule described in this subsection, we propose ergodic interference neutralization in the next subsection.\nWe ﬁrst divide a length- n block into B sub-blocks having length n B = n B each. We assume block transmission. At the ﬁrst sub-block, the sources transmit their ﬁrst messages to the relays (the relays do not transmit). At the bth sub-block, b ∈ {2, · · · , B − 1}, the sources transmit their bth messages to the relays and the relays amplify and forward the received signals of the (b − 1)th sub-block to the destinations. At the last sub- block, the relays amplify and forward the received signals of the (B −1)th sub-block to the destinations (the sources do not transmit). Hence, the number of effective sub-blocks is equal to B −1. Since we can set both n B and B as large as possible as n increases, the fractional rate loss 1 B becomes negligible as n increases. For simplicity, we describe the proposed scheme based on the ﬁrst message transmission and omit the sub-block index.\nFor Q ∈ Q 1 , denote T 1 (Q) = t H[t] ∈ A 1 (Q), t ∈ {1, · · · , n B } , which is the set of time indices of the ﬁrst hop whose channel instances belong to A 1 (Q). Similarly, for Q ∈ Q 2 , denote T 2 (Q) = t G[t] ∈ A 2 (Q), t ∈ {1, · · · , n B } , which is the set of time indices of the second hop whose channel instances belong to A 2 (Q). The encoding, relaying, and decoding are as follows.\n\u2022 (Encoding) The sources transmit their messages using Gaussian codebook with power P . Speciﬁcally, the trans- mit signal vector of the sources is given by x[t] with E x[t]x[t] \u2020 = P I for t ∈ {1, · · · , n B }.\n\u2022 (Relaying) For all Q ∈ Q 1 , the relays amplify and forward their received signals that were received during T 1 (Q) using the time indices in T 2 (F (Q)). Speciﬁcally, the transmit signal vector of the relays is given by x R [t 2 ] = Γ(Q)y R [t 1 ], where t 1 ∈ T 1 (Q), and t 2 ∈ T 2 (F (Q)). Here\n    \nγΛ 1 0 · · · \t 0 0 γΛ 2 \t .. . .. . \t . . .\n    \nwhere Q = [Q T 1 , · · · , Q T K ] T and 0 denotes the (2 × 2) all-zero matrix.\n\u2022 (Decoding) The destinations decode their messages based on their received signals for t ∈ {1, · · · , n B }.\nThen we can set ∆ → 0 and M → ∞, which are functions of n B , such that the rate in Theorem 1 is achievable. We refer to the full paper [14] in preparation for the detailed proof of Theorem 1 and also refer to the paper [12], which is the case where K = 1.\nIn this section, we prove Theorems 2 and 3. For N -user 2-hop networks with L relays, it was shown in [7] that interference can be completely neutralized if L ≥ N(N − 1) + 1, which indicates that for 2 × L × 2 networks with L ≥ 3 interference neutralization can be achieved without channel pairing. However, maximizing the achievable sum rate exploiting interference neutralization without channel pairing presented in [15] is non-convex and, as a result, it is unclear how to determine the sum rate gap from the cut-set upper bound. By contrast, we now show that our achievable rate expression from Theorem 1 permits to derive a ﬁnite-gap result.\nWe ﬁrst introduce the following lemma, which will be used to prove Theorems 2 and 3.\nLemma 1: Consider a sequence of i.i.d. nonnegative ran- dom variables {X m , m ∈ N}. Let S m = \t m i=1 X i . If E [X 1 2 ] < ∞, then for any ∈ (0, E[X 1 ]) and any c > 0,\nBy setting δ m arbitrarily small, Lemma 1 approximately provides that E log(1 + cS m 2 ) ≥ log 1 + cm 2 (E[X 1 ]) 2\nas m increases. This bound is tight in the limit of large m since E log(1 + cS m 2 ) ≤ log(1 + c E[S m 2 ]) from Jensen\u2019s\ninequality and log(1 + c E[S m 2 ]) is approximately given by log(1 + cm 2 E [X 1 ] 2 ) as m increases.\nwhere the second inequality follows from Jensen\u2019s inequality and the fact that log det( ·) is a concave function [16]. Also,\n \n \n \n \nwhere θ k = θ 2k −1,1 + θ 2k,2 − θ 2k −1,2 − θ 2k,1 .

Therefore, Theorem 3 holds.\nThis work has been supported in part by the European ERC Starting Grant 259530-ComCom."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R. H. Etkin"},{"name":"D. Tse"},{"name":"H.
