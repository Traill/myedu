We consider rewritable channels with uniform write noise and a hidden state which models the unknown characteristics of the memory cell. In addition to mitigating the effect of the write noise, rewrites can help the write controller obtain a better estimate of the hidden state.

An important feature of many of these technologies such as FLASH [1] and Phase Change Memory [2] is that they allow rewriting, i.e. the value written on a memory cell can be read and rewritten if necessary. Rewrites can increase the storage capacity but are costly since they are time consuming and degrade the memory. Hence there is a fundamental trade-off between the number of writes and the amount of information that can be stored in a memory cell.\nGiven a memory array of n cells, the goal is to maximize the number of distinct messages that can be reliably encoded in the array, subject to a constraint on the average or maximum number of writes per cell. The cells are assumed to be statistically independent. Rewritable channels were introduced in [3] and subsequently studied in [4]\u2013[6] under an average cost constraint. Maximum cost constrained rewritable channels were considered in [7]\u2013[10].\nThe uniform noise rewrite channel, introduced in [3], is a simple model that captures some essential features of non- volatile memories such as analog inputs and bounded write noise. In this channel, when the input stimulus is X ∈ [0, 1], the value stored in the cell is Y = X + W , where W is a noise variable uniformly distributed in [ −a/2, a/2] for some known a > 0. The capacity for this model under an average cost constraint was determined in [6].\nIn practice, a memory cell is an amalgam of physical components which reacts to inputs in some way that designers hope to model as well as possible. However, there are always some unknown characteristics of the cell (which may be too costly to learn) that introduce an extra degree of uncertainty into the value written on the cell. In this paper, we model this effect with the channel\nwhere S is a hidden (unknown) state variable uniformly distributed in [0, B], for some known B > 0. As before, the stimulus X ∈ [0, 1] and W is a noise variable uniformly distributed in [ −a/2, a/2]. For ease of analysis, we will assume that B < a. A key distinction between the noise W and the state S is that each write attempt on the cell is affected with an independent realization of the random variable W , while the state S stays ﬁxed across write attempts. Given a constraint κ on the average number of rewrites per cell, the problem is to determine the capacity C(κ).\nWe consider the following class of coding strategies. To write on cell i, the write controller applies stimuli X i1 , X i2 , . . . until the output falls within a target region T i , where T i is a subset of the output space [ −a/2, 1 + a/2 + B]. Using X i to denote the writing strategy (X i1 , X i2 , . . .) for cell i, the number of writes needed for the output to fall within region T i is a random variable, denoted τ (X i , T i ). More precisely, a rewrite code of rate R over an array of n cells is deﬁned by:\n\u2022 An encoder mapping which maps a message in {1, . . . , 2 nR } to a sequence ((X 1 , T 1 ), . . . , (X n , T n )), where T i ⊂ [−a/2, 1 + a/2 + B] is the target region for cell i, and X i = (X i1 , X i2 , . . .) is the input strategy for cell i with X ik ∈ [0, 1] for all k.\n\u2022 A decoder which maps the output sequence (Y 1 , . . . Y n ) to {1, . . . , 2 nR }.\nThe average write-cost of the code is 1 n n i=1 Eτ (X i , T i ). Due to the statistical independence of the cells, the capacity for an average cost constraint κ is [3], [6]\nWith each write attempt, we get a better estimate of the hidden state which can be used to generate the next stimulus. For intuition, consider two extreme cases:\n\u2022 When κ = 1, we are allowed only one write attempt and the hidden state is treated as an additional noise variable.\n\u2022 When the average cost constraint κ → ∞, we can spend a number of write attempts to get a very good estimate of the state, and the remaining write attempts to write on the cell by designing the input stimulus to nullify the effect of the state. Thus, we expect to approach the no-state capacity when κ is very large.\nFor 1 < κ < ∞, the challenge is to simultaneously learn the state while attempting to store information at a high rate.\nWe present two code constructions, each of which gives a lower bound on the rewrite capacity. The ﬁrst is sub-optimal but gives insight into features of good coding strategies. The second construction yields the main result of this paper \u2013 a better lower bound which is asymptotically optimal, i.e., it is arbitrarily close to the no-state capacity for sufﬁciently large cost constraint.\nFor the uniform noise rewrite channel without state given by Y = X + W , the basic coding idea is that with an average of κ rewrites, we can shrink the effective width of the noise interval to a/κ. The average-cost capacity was obtained in [6].\nFact 1: [6] For κ ≥ κ 0 \t 1+a a / 1+a a , the rewrite capacity with average cost constraint κ is\nWhen 1+a a κ is an integer, the capacity is achieved by simply dividing the space [ −a/2, 1 + a/2] into equal-sized intervals of length a/κ and choosing the target region T to be one of these intervals with equal probability. The input X is any point which maximizes the probability of the output falling in the region T . When 1+a a κ is not an integer, the capacity is achieved by a careful generalization of the above idea, described in [6].\nWhen there is an unknown state offset S ∈ [0, B], the idea is to deﬁne each target region such that there is exactly one subset of width a/κ that can be accessed with a ﬁxed input and an average of κ writes, irrespective of the offset.\nProposition 1: For the uniform noise rewrite channel with hidden state and average cost κ ≥ 2,\nProof: The target regions : Refer Figure 1. The output space [ −a/2, 1 + a/2 + B] is ﬁrst divided into intervals of length (a + B) each. There are N = 1+a+B a+B such intervals, denoted Z i , 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1. If 1+a+B a+B is not an integer, the remaining output space (N (a + B), 1 + a 2 + B] is discarded.\nFor clarity, consider the case where κ is an integer. Divide each interval Z i into κ target regions. The target regions for the ﬁrst interval are deﬁned as shown in Figure 1. Target region 1 is the interval [ − a 2 , − a 2 + a κ ] ∪[ a 2 , a 2 + a κ ]; region 2 is the interval [ − a 2 + a κ , − a 2 + 2a κ ] ∪ [ a 2 + a κ , a 2 + 2a κ ], and so on. Similarly, κ target regions are deﬁned for each of the N intervals.\nEncoding : To reach target region t in interval Z i for t ∈ {1, . . . , κ}, i ∈ {0, . . . , N −1}, apply input X = (a+B)i until the output falls within region t in interval i. With this input, the accessible part of the target region has width exactly a/κ for any value of S ∈ [0, B]. This is illustrated in the bottom part of Figure 1. Regardless of the offset, the probability of the output falling within the target region on any write attempt is a/κ a . The average number of rewrites is therefore κ.\nThe total number of target regions is N κ and by assigning them equal probability, the rate is\nwhere the ﬁrst equality holds because the input X is a function of the target region T , and the second equality is due to T being uniquely determined by Y .\nThe general case where κ is not an integer can be handled by an extension of the above scheme using the techniques in [6].\nThe ﬁrst term above is the capacity when S = 0, or when S is precisely known at the encoder. The second term is the loss incurred by the coding scheme due the state being unknown.\nIn the above construction, we designed the target regions so that each one can be accessed with equal probability regardless of the value of S. We did not make use of the fact that with each write attempt, we can estimate S with better accuracy. This is reﬂected in the fact that even when the number of rewrites κ is very large, the lower bound of Proposition 1 is strictly less than the capacity with S = 0, given by the ﬁrst term in (5). The next construction remedies this deﬁciency.\nAs shown in Figure 2, divide the output space [ −a/2, 1 + a/2 + B] into two regions: the interval [ −a/2 + B, 1 + a/2] called the \u2018interior\u2019, and the remaining space [ −a/2, −a/2 + B] ∪ [1 + a/2, 1 + a/2 + B] called the \u2018exterior\u2019.\nInterior target regions : Divide the interior into intervals (target regions) of width D. The key observation is that if D < a − B, regardless of the value of S, each interior target region is fully accessible with an average of a/D write attempts with a ﬁxed input. As illustrated in the bottom part of Figure 2, to access the interior target region [x, x + D], apply the stimulus (x + D − a/2) + . To fully access the region with offset b, we need\nExterior target regions : As shown in Figure 2, deﬁne 2m ex- terior target regions for an integer m ≥ 1. For i = 1, . . . , 2m, the ith exterior target region, labeled E i , is\nWith this construction, we present a coding scheme that achieves the following lower bound on the rewrite capacity.\nwhere the maximum is over p ∈ [0, 1], D ∈ (0, a − B) and integers m ≥ 1 that satisfy\n1 − δ i ln δ i + p a D ≤ κ\nwhere the optimal δ i ∈ [0, 1) for i = 1, 2, . . . , m is determined by the following equation:\nRemark : The δ i in the above theorem can chosen to be arbitrary values in [0,1). Picking δ i that satisfy (7) minimizes the number of rewrites, given by the left side of (6). For example, (6) can be replaced by a simpler condition obtained by setting δ i = 0 for all i:\nThe proof of the theorem is given in the next section. Figure 3 shows the lower bound of Theorem 1 with a = 1/3 and B = a/2 for various values of κ.\nWe now show that the above lower bound converges to the no-state capacity as the rewrite constraint κ → ∞.\nProof: Choose D = a/κ and m = B 2D = κ B 2a . Note that for all B < a, D = a/κ < (a − B) for sufﬁciently large κ. With this choice and setting δ i = 0 for all i, the average number of rewrites given by the left-side of (8) becomes\nTo highlight the main ideas, we start with a simpliﬁed coding scheme for the case of m = 1, i.e., two exterior target regions.\nCoding Scheme : Fix p ∈ [0, 1]. For each cell, an interior target region is picked with probability p and an exterior region is picked with probability (1 − p). All interior target regions are equally likely, as are the exterior regions. Formally, each interior region has probability p D 1+a−B and the two exterior regions each have probability (1 − p)/2. Refer Figure 4. To write on interior region [x, x + D], repeatedly apply stimulus (x + D − a/2) + until the output falls within the region.\nTo write on exterior region E 1 : Apply stimulus 1 until either the output falls in (1 + a/2, 1 + a/2 + B/2), or it is less than 1 − a/2 + B/2. If the former occurs, stop. Otherwise, apply stimulus 0 until the output falls in ( −a/2, −a/2 + B/2). The intuition is that the right bin of E 1 is fully accessible with stimulus 1 if the offset lies in the interval [B/2, 1]. We switch to the left bin of E 1 if we detect that the offset lies outside this interval.\nTo write on exterior region E 2 : Apply stimulus 0 until either the output falls in ( −a/2 + B/2, −a/2 + B) or it is greater than a/2 + B/2. If the former occurs, stop. Otherwise, switch to applying stimulus 1 until the output falls in (1 + a/2 + B/2, 1 + a/2 + B). If the offset lies in the interval [0, B/2], the left bin of E 2 is fully accessible with stimulus 0. We switch to the right bin of E 2 if we detect that the offset lies outside this interval.\nAnalysis : Since we have two exterior target regions with probability (1 −p)/2, and 1+a−B D \t interior regions each with probability p/ 1+a−B D , the rate of information stored in each cell is calculated to be\nNext we compute the average number of writes and set it equal to κ.\nκ = p E[# writes | interior] + (1 − p)E[# writes | exterior] = p a D + (1 − p)E[#writes | exterior].\n(10) By symmetry,\nE[# writes | exterior] = E[# writes | ext. region E 1 ] =\n(11) since the right bin of E 1 is fully accessible with stimulus 1 when S ∈ [B/2, B]. We now show that for all b ∈ [0, B/2),\nE[# writes | E 1 , S = b] = 4a/B. \t (12) Recall that for E 1 , we ﬁrst apply stimulus 1 until either the\noutput falls in either (1 + a/2, 1 + a/2 + B/2) or it is less than 1 − a/2 + B/2. For b ∈ [0, B/2), the probability of the ﬁrst event occurring in any write attempt is b/a, and that of the second event occurring is (B/2 − b)/a. Hence the probability of the ﬁrst step being completed in each write attempt, is\n2a . \t (13) Therefore the average number of writes for the ﬁrst step of E 1 is 2a/B for all b ∈ [0, B/2). The probability of the ﬁrst step ending by obtaining an output less than 1 − a/2 + B/2 is \t (B/2 − b)/a\nWhen this event occurs, the average number of additional writes required (by applying stimulus 0) is a/(B/2 − b). Thus for b ∈ [0, B/2), the average number of writes for writing on E 1 is\n(14) Substituting in (11), we obtain\n4a B\n2a B\nwhich corresponds to (6) with m = 1 and δ 1 = 0. We now modify the scheme slightly to reduce the average number of rewrites to the level stated in Theorem 1:\nOptimizing the Switching Strategy : To write on exterior region 1 in Figure 4, the above coding scheme switches from stimulus 1 to stimulus 0 when an output less than 1 − a 2 + B 2\nis obtained. Such an output indicates that the value of the hidden state S is less than B 2 which implies that the right bin of E 1 \u2013 the region [1 + a 2 , 1 + a 2 + B 2 ] \u2013 is not fully accessible with stimulus 1; so the schemes switches to targeting the left bin of E 1 with stimulus 0. This switching strategy is not optimal. Consider a more general switching strategy of the following form: switch from stimulus 1 to 0 once you obtain an output less than 1 − a 2 + B 2 (1 − δ 1 ) for some δ 1 ∈ [0, 1). This corresponds to switching once you detect that S is less than B(1−δ 1 ) 2 . We now determine the optimum value of δ 1 that minimizes the average number of rewrites. By symmetry, the switching strategy for exterior regions E 2 is to switch from stimulus 0 to 1 when you get an output greater than\nwhere E[# writes | E 1 , S = b] with the new switching strategy can be calculated to be\n(19) Substituting this in (18) and calculating the integral, we obtain\n(20) Using (20) in (10) completes the proof for m = 1.\nCoding Scheme : Refer Figure 2. Writing on the interior regions is the same as before: For interior region [x, x + D], repeatedly apply stimulus (x+D −a/2) + . To write on exterior region i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 2m:\n\u2022 If 1 ≤ i ≤ m, write 1 until the output falls in region E i or it is less than 1 − a 2 + B(i−δ i ) 2m , In the ﬁrst case, stop. In the second case, switch to writing 0 until the output falls in the left bin of region i.\n\u2022 If m+1 ≤ i ≤ 2m, write 0 until the output falls in region E i or it is greater than a 2 + B(i−1+δ 2m+1−i ) 2m \t . In the ﬁrst case, stop. In the second case, switch to writing 1 until the output falls in the right bin of region i.\nAnalysis : The rate calculation is straightforward, the only change from the previous subsection being that each of the exterior target regions now represents log 2 2m bits of informa- tion. The average number of writes for an interior target region is a/D. For an exterior region, we calculate it separately for each E i , i = 1, . . . , m as follows. Note that by symmetry, E i and E 2m+1−i have the same average cost. We have\n(21) where E[# writes | E i , S = b] can be calculated to be\nUsing this in (18) and calculating the integral, we obtain that for 1 ≤ i ≤ m:\nThe average number of write attempts for an exterior region is therefore\n1 m\nFor each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, it is easily veriﬁed that the δ i ∈ [0, 1) that minimizes (23) satisﬁes (7). This completes the proof of Theorem 1.\nIn a channel with hidden state, rewrites increase the capacity in two ways: 1) by mitigating the effect of write noise, and 2) by enabling the write controller to get progressively better estimates of the state. The above results generalize to the case where the hidden state is uniformly distributed over a different support set of the same width B. We also remark that the coding scheme of construction 1 can be used when B > a as well. Obtaining upper bounds that are smaller than the no-state capacity is an interesting open problem. Investigating the effect of hidden state in other channel models (e.g., rewritable AWGN channels with hidden Gaussian state) is another direction for future work."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
