Since the early works on distributed turbo-codes [1], they have been numerous coding schemes, proposed for different duplexing modes (half- (HD) and full-duplex (FD) communications) and over different channels (erasure, Gaussian or Rayleigh-fading models) [1]- [2]. Among the proposed schemes, the ones based on sparse- graph codes have been usually considered; their iterative per- formance was mainly evaluated over HD relay channels (asus- ming both orthorgonal and non-orthogonal multiple accesses at the destination terminal). The most studied sparse-graph codes for relay channels are bilayer Low-Density Parity-Check (B- LDPC) codes [3]. The B-LDPC scheme gave rise to numerous extensions and improvements (see [4] and references therein). A recent extension of the B-LDPC scheme is spatially-coupled B-LDPC codes [2].\nAn interesting question is whether the sparse-graph codes perform well over the FD relay channel. Note that the FD case is more involved than the HD case: the FD commu- nication often assumes the non-orthogonal multiple access at the destination end, thus implying a potential decrease in performance of sparse-graph codes (see, for instance, [5] where the observed performance of B-LDPC codes over the FD binary erasure relay channel is not impressive).\nWhat are the codes performing well over the FD relay channel? Trying to respond to this question, we focus on a more general transmission model, the so called block- Markov (BM) DF scheme. Note that the FD relay channel is a particular case of this model. We investigate the asymptotic iterative performance of sparse-graph codes under the BM\nmodel, assuming the binary erasure channel for simplicity of calculation. Two big classes of sparse-graph codes are considered: good erasure-correcting codes and good erasure- detecting (i.e. bad erasure-correcting) codes. The efﬁciency of both of them in the BM transmission model is studied, in order to giving an insight what are the efﬁcient codes for the BM model, and for the FD channel in particular.\nConsider a relay channel that consists of the source S , communicating with the destination D , with the help of the relay node R . For simplicity of analysis, the SR link is assumed to be perfect and all links to D are modeled by binary erasure channels. The channel is described by the operations at S, R and D:\n(R) At R, the DF protocol is assumed [6], i.e. R (perfectly) receives the source message X 1 , computes the bin mes- sage b , re-encodes b to message X 2 (b) , using a code C R , and sends X 2 it to D during the next time slot.\n(i) for OR, the erased versions of X 1 and X 2 (denote them by Y S and Y R ) are received separately, via inde- pendent binary erasure channels with respective erasure probabilities SD and RD ;\n(ii) for NOR, the link from S and R to D is a multiple access channel (MAC) with output Y . W.l.o.g, it is assumed to be the sum mod-2 MAC [5] such that\n    \n   \nX 1 , \t w.p.(1 − SD )(1 − RD ); X 1 ⊕ X 2 , w.p. (1 − SD ) RD ; X 2 , \t w.p. SD (1 − RD ); ?, \t w.p. SD RD ,\nwhere SD and RD are probabilities, quantifying the quality of SD and RD links.\n(S) At S, let ω 1 . . . ω M be M information packets to be sent to D. Then, for each ω, S generates a message X , using\nX 1 = X ⊕ X 2 (b past ), if block-Markov encoding used; X, \t if independent encoding.\nHere b past denotes the bin message computed for the previous transmitted codeword X, and X 2 (b past ) is the codeword from code C R , corresponding to b past . Also, b past = 0 at the beginning of the transmission.\n(SR) If S and R transmit to D simultaneously, the communi- cation is full-duplex (FD), and it is half-duplex (HD) if S and R transmit at different time intervals. In FD regime, at time slot i, R should be able to receive X 1 (ω i ) from S and to send X 2 (b i (X(i − 1))) to D at the same time. Note that the HD communication is always OR at D, the FD one may be both OR (reception at separate frequency bands for SD and RD links) and NOR (same frequency band).\nAll versions of the transmission protocol from the previous section can be represented by means of a general block-Markov (BM) scheme , given in Fig.1. In this ﬁgure, the i-th block C S C R represents the bilayer coding block [3] with two codes C S and C R , corresponding to information message ω i , and linked through the bin message b(X(i)) (see Fig.2). The block T i represents the transmission function, used at transmission i. This function depends on the reception mode at D (OR or NOR), on the encoding procedure at S (block-Markov or independent encoding) and on the channel model (e.g. binary erasure channel).\nThe general scheme in Fig.1 is a block-Markov chain of order 1. It degenerates to order 0 (i.e. al C S C R blocks become\ndisjoint) only in the case of independent encoding at S and OR at D.\n1) If b(X) = ω, this corresponds to the bilayer-lengthened (BL) construction from [3]. One thus deﬁnes the BL- LDPC ensemble if both C S and C R codes are LDPC, or the BL-LDGM ensemble (if both codes are LDGM 1 );\n2) If b is a linear combination of bits of X, this corresponds to the bilayer-expurgated (BE) construction from [3]. Usually, |b| < |ω|. BE-LDPC or BE-LDGM ensembles may be deﬁned in a similar way.\nExamples of transmission functions T : Assume binary era- sure channel. Denote by p and p 2 the respective erasure probabilities of messages X and X 2 . Also, denote ¯ x = 1 − x. Then there are four cases:\nOne takes advantage of the memory of the block-Markov scheme during decoding process. Let us consider two possible decoding schedules: joint iterative decoding and backward decoding .\nJoint iterative decoding is a version of the joint decoding algorithm, and it consists of the following steps:\n(2) Perform one forward and one backward steps of decoding through the Markov chain and compute the estimates\n(3) Set l := l + 1 and return to Step (2), until the maximum number L of forward/backward decodings is reached.\nNote that the joint iterative decoding is optimal, if the local decoding of each C S C R block is based on the maximum- likelihood decoding algorithm; it is therefore sub-optimal if C S C R block are based on sparse-graph codes and are decoded iteratively.\nBackward decoding is simply deﬁned as the ﬁrst backward step of the joint iterative decoding.\nFor a decoding algorithm A, let us deﬁne the decoding success and the decoding convergence region:\nDeﬁnition 1: Given the couple ( SD , RD ), the decoding is said to be successful under decoding algorithm A if all messages X(i), 1 ≤ i ≤ M , are successfully recovered. Moreover, the convergence region Γ (A) , associated with A, is the ensemble of all couples ( SD , RD ) so that the decoding is successful.\nRemark that Γ (A) is in fact included into the \u201dtrue\u201d con- vergence region, for which one would ask for recovering w\u2019s\nonly, instead of recovering X\u2019s in whole. However, numerical results show that the two regions are very close, and the region Γ (A) is much easier to manipulate.\nIn next sections, we ﬁnd convergence regions Γ BWD and Γ JNT for respective backward and joint iterative decoding al- gorithms. Two cases are treated separately: erasure correcting (EC) codes and erasure-detecting (ED) codes.\nIn order to perform the analysis, one should deﬁne the evolution of erasure probabilities during forward and backward steps of joint iterative decoding (while backward decoding is a particular case of the joint iterative one).\nConsider the i-th block C S C R . During forward step l, one computes the estimate of X 2 (i), given the estimate of X(i) from step l and the estimate of X 2 (i) from step (l − 1) (see Fig.2). We denote by α (l) i−1 the erasure probability of X(i) and by α (l) i \u2013 the erasure probability of X 2 (i) after forward decoding. Similarly, during backward step l, one computes the estimate of X(i), given the estimate of X 2 (i) from step l and the estimate of X(i) from step (l − 1). We denote by β (l) i the erasure probability of X 2 (i) and by β (l) i−1 \u2013 the erasure probability of X(i) after backward decoding. These four probabilities are shown in Fig.3.\nwhere F fwd and F bwd are forward and backward transfer functions for block C S C R . If C S C R is a sparse-graph bilayer code, decoded iteratively, the transfer functions may be com- puted via corresponding BP EXIT curves (see, for instance, Thm.3.120 [7]). Note that both F fwd and F bwd are indexed by erasure probabilities from step (l − 1). It can be shown that:\nProposition 1: 1) F x (y) is non-decreasing both with x and with y; 2) F 0 (0) = 0 and F 1 (1) = 1.\nThe indices will be further omitted for simpliﬁcation. We will further need the following quantity:\nDeﬁnition 2: Given erasure probabilities and 2 , related to messages X and X 2 at two inputs of block C S C R , one deﬁnes Γ( , 1 ) to be the convergence region of C S C R , i.e. the ensemble of all couples ( , 2 ) so that the decoding of the block C S C R is successful.\nSimilarly to the previous case, output erasure probabilities at forward/backward step l for transmission block T i are linked with input probabilities as (see Fig.4):\nwhere G fwd and G bwd are forward and backward transfer functions for transmission block T .\nDensity evolution equations for some BM schemes have been ﬁrst derived in [5]. However, here we present them by means of transfer functions F fwd , F bwd , G fwd and G bwd . Such a representation is easier to understand as it is somewhat similar to EXIT charts [8].\nfwd (1), if 2 ≤ i ≤ M, G fwd (0), if i = 1,\nbwd (1), if 1 ≤ i ≤ M − 1, G bwd (0), if i = M,\nThe density evolution at step l can be represented graphi- cally. As an example , the evolution of α\u2019s is given in Fig.5.\nThe joint iterative decoding converges asymptotically for given couple ( SD, RD ), if at least one of α (∞) ∞ and β (∞) ∞ is 0. The backward decoding converges asymptotically, if β (1) ∞ = 0.\nDeﬁnition 3: EC codes are codes so that, in the limit of large codelengths n, the erasure probability after decoding x given input erasure probability is 0 if < ∗ and is 0 for\nMany known families of existing codes (e.g. convolutional codes, LDPC codes, turbo codes etc.) are EC codes.\nWhen the bilayer C S C R scheme is based on good EC codes, then the following approximations are tight:\nnamely F fwd and F bwd can be approximated by step functions. Then the following holds:\nMain idea of the proof: Consider the forward step (the backward step is similar). By Fig.1, the input message of the 1st block C S C R is G fwd (0), while the initial parameter β = G bwd (1). If (G fwd (0), 1) ∈ Γ, then the output message is 0, and the input message of the 2nd block C S C R is again G fwd (0). Therefore, one can show that the forward step of decoding is successful if and only if the decoding of one C S C R block with input parameters G fwd (0) and G bwd (1) is successful.\nNote that, for EC codes, the forward/backward evolution has a different behaviour than illustrated in Fig.5: as the curve F is a step function, then the convergence point is achieved in only one step, and it is either (1, 1) (decoding failure) or (0, 0) (decoding success).\nTheorem 1: For EC codes, Γ BWD ⊆ Γ and Γ JNT ⊆ Γ. Therefore:\nCorrollary 1: The necessary condition to design a capacity- approaching BM scheme based on EC codes, is to choose a capacity-approaching C S C R bilayer code.\nDeﬁnition 4: ED codes are codes so that, in the limit of large codelengths n, the erasure probability after decoding x smoothly increases with input erasure probability . So, if ∗ is the decoding threshold, then x( ∗ + ∆ ) = x( ∗ ) + ∆x with ∆x relatively small.\nED codes are typically bad erasure-correctors (e.g. LDGM codes under iterative decoding), as their threshold ∗ lies far from the theoretical limit. Using ED codes simply imply that F fwd and F bwd are smoothly increasing with channel erasure probabilities. So the forward/backward evolution of erasure probabilities is smooth as well, as it is illustrated in Fig.5.\nWe obtain an interesting result here: the performance of the BM scheme based on ED codes may be better than the performance of one ED C S C R block. So, is it possible to attain the theoretical limit by using this scheme, for any couple of channel erasure probabilitiies? Unfortunately,\nTheorem 3: The BM scheme based on ED codes is bounded away from capacity for SD = 1.\nProof: W.l.o.g., consider OR. For SD = 1, one has G fwd (y) = 1 and G bwd (y) = RD . Thus the BM scheme is broken into separate blocks C S C R . So, Γ JNT = Γ, which is strictly included into the capacity convergence region.\nOne can show that at another extreme point RD = 1, the BM scheme is not bounded from the capacity. Therefore, the use of an ED C S code may be beneﬁcial for asymptotic performance of the overall BM scheme, while it is better to keep the EC C R code. Such a construction is given in Section VI. However, before it let us give an example of two ED codes, in order to illustrate Theorem 2 and to show that indeed one gets an improvement of the convergence region, if the block- Markov encoding is used (i.e. the BM chain has memory > 1, independently on the reception mode).\nConsider the example when the C S C R code is a BL- LDGM code, i.e. two ED codes C S and C R are two LDGM codes with respective degree distributions (λ S (x), ρ S (x)) and (λ R (x), ρ R (x)). To improve Γ JNT , one can optimize distribu- tions λ S (x) and λ R (x) (for simplicity, ﬁxed ρ\u2019s are assumed):\nThis is a non-linear optimization problem, and it can be solved numerically (e.g. using blind random search optimization [9]).\nExample 1: Let C R be a code taken from a regular (x 4 , x 4 ) LDGM ensemble, having the iterative decoding threshold\n∗ = 0.313. Soving the optimization problem stated above, we obtain\nλ S (x) = 0.048x + 0.048x 2 + 0.02x 3 + 0.0196x 4 + 0.046x 5 +0.044x 6 + 0.103x 7 + 0.064x 8 + 0.061x 9 + 0.017x 10\nThe upper boundary of Γ JNT of the obtained BM scheme, with the block-Markov encoding, is given in Fig.6. Dashed lines represent OR, full lines \u2013 NOR. Black curves are computed upper boundaries; theoretical limits are drawn in grey. Note that at RD = 1, the gap to capacity is very small, around 0.003, due to the ED C R code and the BM structure. The gap to capacity is large at SD = 1, which is also consistent with our analysis.\nA possible way to design an efﬁcient bilayer C S C R code in the BM scheme of memory > 1 is to choose the C R code to be a (capacity-approaching) EC code and the C S code to be an ED code. Let us consider the following construction:\nDeﬁnition 5: Bilayer-Expurgated LDGM (BE-LDGM) codes are bilayer C S C R codes such that C S and C R codes are given respectively by an LDGM and an LDPC, and b(X) = ω. Corresponding degree distributions are denoted by (λ S (x), ρ S (x)) and (λ R (x), ρ R (x)).\nbe the iterative threshold of the constituent LDPC part. The BE-LDGM ensemble simultaneously approaches the theoretical limit in both points SD = 1 and RD = 1 if\nwhere th RD and th SD denote Shannon limits for R-D and S-D links, and L S (x) is the node-perspective degree distribution of variable nodes for the C S ensemble (i.e. LDGM).\nProof: For SD = 1, the C S C R performance is condi- tioned by the performance of the LDPC part (the LDGM is not able to decode at all), so (10) follows directly. Further, if\nRD = 1, then the C S C R decoding succeeds if the decoding of the LDGM part has the output probability < ∗ LDP C .\nExample 2: Choose the C R part to be an LDPC ensemble with a constant check degree and λ(x) taken from [10]. Such an ensemble has the gap to capacity 10 −3 over the BEC. Choose the C S part to be the (x 4 , x 4 ) LDGM ensemble. Note that (10) and (11) both hold. Upper boundaries of Γ JNT are shown in Fig.7: dashed lines represent OR, full lines \u2013 NOR. One can see that the obtained boundaries lie quite close to theoretical limits. For comparison, the dotted curve represents the upper boundary for the scheme with independent encoding and OR, based on spatially-coupled (3,6,128) LDPC ensemble from [2], which is one of efﬁcient codes for OR, known by now. The boundary of our scheme (black dashed one) lies below the dotted curve; however, any optimization of the BE- LDGM code have not been done yet \u2013 our design criterion\nM.I. was ﬁnanced by the DIM COREPHY project. Authors thank K. Kasai for providing simulation results of spatially- coupled bilayer codes.\nIn this paper, we have shown that one can design efﬁcient sparse-graph bilayer codes, by choosing the C S code to be erasure-detecting (ED) and making use of the block-Markov encoding at S. Note that the construction behaves well for any reception mode, OR or NOR, in contrast to all other bilayer structures, which behave well for OR only. Whether or not one can approach the capacity boundary with this construction is still an open question."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M. Valenti"},{"name":"B.
