When this knowledge is acquired through a quantized feedback scheme, its quality is roughly determined by the number of feedback bits. In this paper we investigate feedback optimization problems for the quantized feedback scheme via random vector quantization (RVQ) in a two-cell MIMO broad- cast channel. Assuming each user knows its direct and interfering channel states perfectly, we address the following question: given a total number of feedback bits, how should a user allocate those bits to quantize its direct and cross channel information? We pose that question for different levels of BS cooperation, namely Network MIMO and Coordinated Beamforming (CBf). We focus on regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding structures and derive our results in the large system limit where the number of users and antennas per BS tend to inﬁnity with their ratio being ﬁxed. We show that for both cooperation schemes, each user should allocate more bits to quantize the cross channel as the latter\u2019s gain ( ) increases. We also show that, contrary to the full channel knowledge case, under this limited feedback scheme, for some values of , no cooperation between the BSs is preferred."},"body":{"text":"The main challenge faced by multi-cell wireless networks that adopt the next 4G standards to achieve peak data rates of 1 Gbit/s for low mobility and 100 Mbit/s for high mobility is the inter-cell interference. In conventional networks, with no cooperation between base stations (BSs), it is hard to achieve those data rates. Allowing the BSs to cooperate, by sharing control signals, channel state information (CSI) and user data via backhaul links, will boost the spectral efﬁciency [1, and references therein].\nBS cooperation can be implemented at different levels [1]. In the Network MIMO scheme, also called multi-cell process- ing (MCP), the CSI and user data are exchanged amongst BSs. This full cooperation requires high capacity backhaul links which is sometimes not viable in practical settings. To alleviate this requirement, only CSI is shared amongst base stations in the interference coordination scheme [1]. More information about these schemes and related issues are discussed in [1].\nIn addition to the backhaul costs, the advantages of co- operation are also accompanied by the overhead cost of the CSI acquisition via channel training and feedback in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. Taking this overhead cost into consideration, the conventional single-cell processing (SCP)\nIn this paper, we investigate feedback optimizations for different levels of cooperation, namely for network MIMO and interference coordination schemes. We assume perfect downlink CSI training so that all the users know their CSI perfectly, and focus on studying how to split a total feedback rate between the direct channel and interfering (cross) channel as a function of different system parameters, including the channel gains of these links. In this work, at the base stations, the user data are precoded by a regularized zero-forcing (RZF) type beamformer. In [4], such precoders were shown to be optimal, in terms of minimizing the total downlink transmit power while satisfying a speciﬁed target SINR, for different levels of cooperation in a symmetric two-cell network where the number of antennas and users in each cell is allowed to go to inﬁnity with their ratio being ﬁxed. This is also the channel model we will be considering in this work.\nWhile channel state feedback in the single-cell system has received a considerable amount of attention so far, fewer works have addressed this problem in multi-cell settings: we will only mention some works that are closely related to ours. For the interference coordination scheme, [5] investigated the limited feedback via RVQ in an inﬁnite Wyner cellular model using generalized eigenvector beamforming at the base stations. The authors derived an optimal bit partitioning strategy for direct and interfering channels that minimizes the sum-rate gap. The other work, also in the interference coordination setting, [6] studies both CSI training and feedback optimization for the analog and quantized feedback for what they call the inter- cell interference cancellation (ICIC) scheme.\nSimilar to [5] and [6], we perform feedback optimization in an interference-coordination scheme, in our case, coor- dinated beamforming. We focus on digital feedback using RVQ: the analog feedback case was treated in previous work [7]. However, unlike those works, we do not assume intra- cell TDMA in each cell, and hence each user experiences both intra-cell and inter-cell interference. We also consider a different type of precoder, namely regularized zero-forcing or channel inversion. Moreover, we also analyze the feedback optimization for other levels of cooperations between the base stations, albeit only for the two cell setup.\nand CBf, SINR expressions in the large system limit: these are used to derive optimal bit allocation for users to feed back their direct and cross channel state information. For both cooperation schemes, we show that, under a total feedback rate constraint, the optimal bit allocation for the direct channel decreases as the cross channel gain increases. This result agrees with that in [5]. For the network MIMO, we also show that the user will allocate all the bit rate available to quantize the direct channel only when = 0. For the CBf, this happens for values of less than a threshold th ≥ 0. Moreover, it can be also shown that for some values of , the single- cell processing performs better than network MIMO and CBf, unlike the case of perfect CSI at the BSs where cooperation always outperforms SCP [4].\nWe consider a symmetric two-cell broadcast channel where each cell has K single antenna users and a base station equipped with N antennas. The channel between user k in cell j and the BS in cell i is denoted by row vector h k,j,i where h k,j,j ∼ CN (0, I N ) and h k,j,¯ j ∼ CN (0, I N ) , for j = 1, 2 and ¯j = mod (j, 2) + 1. We refer to the h k,j,j as direct channels and h k,j,¯ j as cross or \u201cinterfering\u201d channels. We ﬁnd it useful to group these into a single channel vector\nWe consider an FDD system and assume that the users have perfect knowledge of their downlink channels, h k,j,j and h k,j,¯ j . Each user feeds back the channel information to the direct BS and neighboring BS through the corresponding uplink channels. The BSs estimate or recover these channel states and use them to construct the precoder.\nwhere x i ∈ C N , i = 1, 2 is the transmitted data from BS i, and n k,j ∼ CN (0, σ 2 d ) is the noise at the user\u2019s receiver. The transmitted data x i depends on the level of cooperation assumed, and will be described in more details in Sections II-B and II-C: we restrict ourselves to linear precoding schemes, more speciﬁcally regularized zero-forcing approaches. We assume each BS\u2019s transmission is subject to a power constraint E x i 2 = P i . In the network MIMO case, we relax this constraint to a sum power constraint so that E x 2 = 2 i=1 P i = P t . In the analysis, we assume P 1 = P 2 = P and denote γ d = P/σ 2 d .\nAs already mentioned, in practical scenarios, perfect CSI is difﬁcult to obtain and the CSI at the BSs is obtained through feedback from the users. In this paper, we are interested in \u2018digital CSI feedback\u2019, where each user sends quantized versions of the direct and interfering channel information to the BS. Thus, user k in cell j uses B k,j,j and B k,j,¯ j bits to quantize or feed back the direct and interfering channel, respectively. The total number of feedback bits is assumed to be ﬁxed. Also, each user has different codebooks to quantize\nthe direct and interfering channel, respectively. Moreover, these codebooks are different for each user. In this work, B k,j,j is the same for all users and B k,j,j = B d , ∀k, j = 1, 2. Similarly, B k,j,¯ j = B c , ∀k, j = 1, 2. The total number of feedback bits is denoted by B t , where B t = B d + B c .\nSince optimal codebook design for the quantized feedback may be difﬁcult, in this paper, for analytical tractability, we consider the well-known RVQ scheme. The quantization vec- tors in the codebook are independently and randomly chosen from the isotropic distribution on the N-dimensional unit sphere [8], [9]. Let ˆu k,j,i be the vector in the corresponding codebook which is closest to the channel direction h k,j,i h k,j,i and let τ 2 k,j,i be the quantization distortion. From [8], for a given τ k,j,i , we can model h k,j,i as follows\nwhere z k,j,i is isotropically distributed in the null-space of ˆ u k,j,i and it is independent of τ k,j,i .\nEach user then sends the index of ˆu k,j,i and also the channel magnitude h k,j,i (see also [10]). By assuming that the BSs can receive the information perfectly, the channel estimate at the BS can be written as\nand v k,j,i ∼ CN (0, I) is independent of h k,j,i . Thus, (1) becomes\nNote that h k,j,i has the same statistical distribution as h k,j,i i.e., h k,j,i ∼ CN (0, ji I) , where ji = 1 when i = j and otherwise, ji = .\nThe channel estimates are used by the BSs to con- struct the precoder. In what follows, let us denote\nIn the network MIMO setting, both BSs share the channel information and data symbols for all users in the network. Therefore, we may consider the network as a broadcast chan- nel with 2N transmit antennas and 2K single antenna users. The BSs construct the precoding matrix using their channel estimates. In this work, we consider regularized channel in- version precoding, for which the precoding or beamforming vector for user k in cell j, w kj , can be written as\nwhere s kj ∼ CN (0, 1) denotes the symbol to be transmitted to user k in cell j and c is a scaling factor ensuring the total power constraint E[ x 2 ] = P t is met with equality. The regularization parameter α controls the amount of interference introduced to the users.\nLet O = (H H H + αI) −1 . The SINR attained by the user k in cell j is given by\nwhere H k,j is obtained from H by removing the row corre- sponding to user k in cell j.\nIn this scheme, the base stations only share the channel information, so that, for cell j, x j can be expressed as\nwhere as in the network MIMO case s kj ∼ CN (0, 1) denotes the symbol to be transmitted to user k in cell j. We let\n \nwhich is an extension of regularized zero-forcing to the coordinated beamforming setup [4]. The constant c j is chosen to satisfy per-BS power constraint E[ x j 2 ] = P j , j = 1, 2 . Note that designing the precoding matrix at BS j requires local CSI only (the h k,i,j from BS j to all users, but not the channels from the other BS to the users). The SINR of user k in cell j is given by\nIn this section, we derive approximations of the SINR for network MIMO (4) and CBf (5) by analyzing them in the large system limit where N → ∞, K/N → β, β > 0 being some ﬁnite constant. We refer to these approximations as the limiting SINRs and use them to optimize the feedback bit allocation, and regularization parameter. This joint optimization problem can be split into two steps. First, we derive the optimal bit allocation, i.e., the optimal ¯ B d = B d N and ¯ B c = B c N . Plugging the optimal bit allocation back into the limiting SINR expression, we can then proceed to the second step where we obtain the optimal regularization parameter. At the end of the section, some comparisons of the limiting SINR and bit allocation values for the two schemes are illustrated. Due to the space limitation, all the proofs for the theorems and\npropositions are omitted. Interested readers may refer to the longer version of this paper [11]. A. Network MIMO\nTheorem 1: Let ρ M = (1 + ) −1 α/N and g(β, ρ) be the solution of g(β, ρ) = ρ + β 1+g(β,ρ) −1 . In the large system limit, the signal strength and the interference energy in (4) converge in probability to\n(7) respectively, where\nd = 1 − 2 − ¯ B d + 1 − 2 − ¯ B c 1 + \t . \t (8) Consequently, the SINR converges in probability to a deter- ministic quantity given by\n, \t (9) where\nTheorem 1 shows that the limiting SINR is the same for all users in both cells. This is not surprising given the symmetry in their channel statistics and feedback mechanisms. Moreover, the only dependence of the limiting SINR on the bit allocation is via γ e , which itself is a function of d: d can be interpreted as a measure of the total quality of the channel estimates; In fact, given that ¯ B d and ¯ B c are constrained to sum up to ¯ B t , d in (8) highlights a trade-off between increasing feedback bits for direct channel and cross channel.\nIt is easy to check that the limiting SINR is an increasing function of d. Thus, obtaining an optimal bit allocation that maximizes the limiting SINR is equivalent to maximizing d, i.e. solving (cf. Eq. (8)).\nwhere X t = 2 − ¯ B t , ¯ B t = B t N and x d = 2 − ¯ B d . Theorem 2 characterizes the optimal solution of this problem.\nTheorem 2: SINR ∞ MCP is maximized by allocating ¯ B d = − log 2 (x ∗ d ) bits to feed back the direct channel information, and ¯\nB c = ¯ B t − ¯ B d to feed back the interfering channel information, where x ∗ d is the positive (real) solution of the following quartic equation\nx 4 d − X t x 3 d + ( X t ) 2 (x d − 1) = 0, \t (12) How does the optimal bit allocation vary with ? Since\n(decreases). This is consistent with the intuition that for higher , more resources would be allocated to quantize the cross\nchannel information. If = 0, x ∗ d = X t , so that when there is no interference from the neighboring BS, all feedback bits are used to convey the direct channel states, as expected. At the other extreme, if → ∞, x ∗ d → 1 and ¯ B d → 0.\nIt is also interesting to see how the total distortion after optimal bit allocation behaves as the cross channel gain varies. Let d ∗ be d evaluated at x d = x ∗ d . By taking ∂d ∗ ∂ , we can show the following property.\nProposition 3: For ≤ 1, d ∗ is decreasing in and increasing for ≥ 1. Consequently, d ∗ is minimum at = 1. As mentioned previously, x ∗ d increases and consequently 1−x ∗ d decreases as increases. On the other side, 1 − X t /x ∗ d is getting larger. So, from the calculation we can conclude that ¯ d ∗ is mostly affected by 1 − x ∗ d for ≤ 1, while for the other values of , the other term takes over.\nWe now proceed to ﬁnd the optimal regularization parameter that maximizes SINR ∞ MCP . The result is summarized below.\nTheorem 4: Let γ ∗ e be γ e evaluated at d = d ∗ . The optimal ρ M that maximizes SINR ∞ MCP (d ∗ ) is\n, \t (13) The corresponding limiting SINR is given by\nFrom Theorem 4, d ∗ affects the limiting SINR via effective SNR γ ∗ e . The latter grows with d ∗ (cf. (10)). In Proposition 3, we established how d ∗ changes with . We can show that γ ∗ e has a similar behavior but reaches its minimum at a different value of due to the last term in the denominator in (10). As SINR ∗,∞ MCP increases with γ ∗ e , both behave similarly as varies.\nTheorem 5: Let ρ C = α N and Γ Q be the solution of the following cubic equation\nLet φ d = 1 − 2 − ¯ B d , φ c = 1 − 2 − ¯ B c , δ d = 2 − ¯ B d and δ c = 2 − ¯ B c . In the large system limit, the signal strength and interference energy in (5) converges almost surely to\n(15) and\n+ δ d + δ c , \t (16) respectively. It follows that the SINR (5) converges almost surely to a deterministic quantity given by\nAs in Theorem 1, Theorem 5 shows that that the limiting SINR is the same for all users. The quantization error variance of estimating the direct channel, δ d , affects both the signal strength (via φ d ) and the interference energy, in which it cap- tures the effect of the intra-cell interference. δ c , on the other hand, only contributes to the interference term: It represents the quality of the cross channel and determines the strength of the inter-cell interference. Since ¯ B t is ﬁxed, increasing ¯ B d , or equivalently reducing ¯ B c , will strengthen the desired signal and reduce the intra-cell interference: it does so, however, at the expense of strengthening the inter-cell interference. Thus, feedback bits\u2019 allocation is important in order to improve the performance of the system.\nThe optimal bit allocation that maximizes (17) can be found by solving\nTheorem 6: For a ﬁxed ¯ B t , the optimal bit allocation, in term of x d = 2 − ¯ B d , that maximizes SINR ∞ CBf is given by\nThe stationary point, X d , is obtained by evaluating the ﬁrst derivative of the limiting SINR w.r.t. x d . Letting Z = −x 2 d ( 1 γ d + 1 + G 3 ) + (G 3 − 1)(2X t x d − X t ) , it can be veriﬁed that the sign of Z is the same as the sign of the derivative of the limiting SINR over x d . Thus, X d will be the unique positive solution of the quadratic equation Z = 0.\nIt can be also checked that ∂Z ∂x d < 0 and thus, Z is decreasing in x d . Since at x d = 1 , Z < 0, we should never allocate x ∗ d = 1 . We will allocate x d = X t if Z ≤ 0 at x d = X t (this condition is satisﬁed whenever ≤ th ).\nUnlike the network MIMO case where x ∗ d = X t only when = 0 , in the CBf, it is optimal for a user to allocate all B t\nto the direct channel when 0 ≤ ≤ th . Note that x ∗ d = X t does not imply that the cooperation breaks down or that both BSs perform single-cell processing. It is easy to check that th increases when ¯ B t or γ d is decreased. This suggests that when the resource for the feedback bits is scarce or the received SNR is low then it is preferable for the user to allocate all the feedback bits to quantize the direct channel. So, in this situation, quantizing the cross channel does more harm to the performance the system. However, as increases beyond th , quantizing the cross channel will improve the SINR. We can show that x ∗ d , particularly X d , is increasing in .\nOnce we have the optimal bit allocation, we can ﬁnd the optimal ρ C , as we did for network MIMO. While tractable, this problem is more complicated, and is skipped due to space limitations. Interested readers may refer to [11].\nIn the following, we present numerical simulations that show the behavior of the limiting SINR and optimal bit allocation for network MIMO and CBf as varies. We set the SNR at 10 dB, ¯ B t = 4 and β = 0.6. The optimal bit allocation is illustrated in Figure 1. As shown in Section III, the optimal ¯ B d for network MIMO is decreasing in and\n¯ B ∗ d = ¯ B t when = 0. For CBf, ¯ B ∗ d = ¯ B t when ≤ 0.19, and after that decreases as grows. Overall, for given , ¯ B ∗ d for CBf is larger than for network MIMO, implying the quality of the direct channel information is more important for CBf.\nIn Figure 2, the optimal values for the regularization param- eter and bit allocation are used to compute the limiting SINR. From that ﬁgure, it is obvious that SINR ∞ CBf decreases as\nincreases. In the case of network MIMO, as predicted by the analysis, the lower bound of the limiting SINR is decreasing until ∗ M,RVQ ≈ 0.72 and increasing after that point. By compar- ing the limiting SINR for both cooperation schemes, it is also interesting to see that for some values of , i.e., in the interval when CBf has ¯ B ∗ c = 0 , the CBf slightly outperforms network MIMO. We should note that within the current scheme, when\n¯ B ∗ c = 0 , CBf and network MIMO are not the same as single- cell processing (SCP): under RVQ, there is still a quantization vector in the codebook that is used to represent the cross channel (although it is uncorrelated with the actual channel vector being quantized).\nMotivated by the above facts, we investigate whether SCP provides some advantages over network MIMO and CBf for some (low) values of . In SCP, we use B k,j,j = ¯ B t = 4 bits (∀k, j) to quantize the direct channel. The cross channels in the precoder are represented by vectors with zero entries. From Figure 2, it is obvious that the SCP outperforms network MIMO and CBf for some values of . For up to ≈ 0.13, SCP outperforms both network MIMO and CBf. Surprisingly, the CBf is still beaten by SCP until ≈ 0.82. This means that the SCP still gives advantages over the CBf even in a quite strong interference regime with this level of feedback.\nIn this paper, we have performed the bit allocation opti- mization for quantized feedback with RVQ in two-cell net- work MIMO and coordinated beamforming schemes. For both cooperation schemes, we showed that as increases, the bit allocation for the cross channel is non-decreasing. In the network MIMO case, each user allocates all bits to quantize the direct channel only when = 0 while in the CBf it happens when is below a certain threshold. We also showed that for some values of , SCP outperforms both cooperation schemes."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"D. Gesbert"},{"name":"S. Hanly"},{"name":"H. Huang"},{"name":"S.
