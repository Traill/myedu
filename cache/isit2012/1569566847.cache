With channel-state information at the receiver (CSIR) and transmitter (CSIT), it is advantageous to simultaneously transmit to multiple receivers [2]. With CSIR but no CSIT, orthogonal transmission (e.g., TDMA) achieves optimal degrees of freedom [2], [3]. With neither CSIT nor CSIR, again TDMA achieves the best possible degrees of freedom [4].\nRecently, we have shown [1] that TDMA is no longer optimal if the receivers have unequal CSIR, e.g., one receiver has full CSIR and another has no CSIR. A superposition signaling that broadcasts to two receivers on Grassmannian achieves higher multiplexing gain than TDMA.\nThe study of broadcast channels with varying CSIR is motivated by downlink scenarios where users have different mobilities. The low-mobility users have the opportunity to reliably estimate their channels, while the high-mobility users do not have the same opportunity.\nThis paper studies the broadcast channel with unequal CSIR, and proposes a superposition signaling that achieves degrees of freedom uniformly higher than [1]. It is shown that the proposed signaling attains the optimal degrees of freedom under a wide set of antenna conﬁgurations. In the proposed scheme, the signals of the two receivers are multiplied to produce the broadcast signal. The information for the receiver with CSIR (the static receiver) is carried by the signal matrix values (coherent signaling), while the information for the receiver without CSIR (the dynamic receiver) is transported on the Grassmannian. The static receiver is required to per- form interference decoding of the dynamic signal, while the dynamic receiver decodes by treating the static signal as noise.\nWe consider a broadcast channel with an M-antenna trans- mitter and two receivers. One of the receivers has access to channel state information, and is referred to as the static receiver. The other receiver has no channel state information, e.g., due to mobility, and is referred to as the dynamic receiver. The dynamic receiver has N 1 antennas and the static receiver has N 2 antennas (N 1 ≤ N 2 ). Denote the channel coefﬁcient matrix from the transmitter to the dynamic and static receivers by H 1 ∈ C N 1 ×M and H 2 ∈ C N 2 ×M , respectively. We assume that H 1 is constant for intervals of T symbols, and is unknown by either receiver. The channel coefﬁcient matrix H 2 is perfectly known by the static receiver but unknown by the dynamic receiver. 1\nOver T time-slots (symbols), the transmitter sends a signal matrix X = [x 1 , · · · , x M ] t over M antennas, where x i ∈ C T ×1 is the transmitted signal vector over the antenna i. The normalized signal at the dynamic and static receivers is respectively\nwhere W 1 ∈ C N 1 ×T and W 2 ∈ C N 2 ×T are additive noise with i.i.d. entries CN (0, 1). Each row of Y 1 ∈ C N 1 ×T (or Y 2 ∈ C N 2 ×T ) corresponds to the received signal at an antenna of the dynamic receiver (or the static receiver) over T time- slots. The transmitter has an average power constraint ρ, and therefore, in the normalized channel model given by (1), we\nWe assume H 1 has i.i.d. entries with zero mean and unit variance but do not assign any speciﬁc distribution for H 1 . This general model includes Rayleigh fading as a special case, where the entries of H 1 are i.i.d. CN (0, 1). For H 2 the channel is assumed to have full column (or row) rank; this assumption holds with probability 1 if H 2 has i.i.d. and continuous valued entries. The transmitter has no channel state information.\nThe degrees of freedom for the dynamic receiver (i = 1) and the static receiver (i = 2) is deﬁned as\nDeﬁnition 1 (Grassmann manifold [5]): The Grassmann manifold G(n, k), where n > k, is the set all k-dimensional subspaces of C n .\nWe brieﬂy introduce the basic of communication over Grassmannian (see [6], [7] for more details). Consider a point- to-point M × N MIMO channel where the receiver does not know the channel H, i.e., a non-coherent channel. At high SNR the additive noise is negligible, so the received signal Y ≈ HX, where X is the transmitted signal. Since X is multiplied by a random and unknown H, the receiver cannot decode the exact X. Nevertheless, the multiplication of H does not affect the subspace speciﬁed by X: for any non- singular H, the received signal Y spans the same row space as X. Therefore, the row space of X can be used to carry information even without knowing H, i.e., the information is mapped into signal matrices with different row spaces.\nFor non-coherent MIMO channels, the design of an optimal signaling can be viewed as sphere packing over Grassman- nian [6]. At high SNR, the optimal signals are isotropically distributed unitary matrices [7], [6]. The optimal number of transmit antenna K depends on the channel coherence time:\nwhere T is the channel coherence time, i.e., the number of symbols that the channel remains constant. Therefore, the optimal signals are K × T unitary matrices. These unitary matrices reside in G(T, K) and each is interpreted as a representation of the subspace it spans. This method achieves the maximum degrees of freedom (over T time-slots)\nWe consider an orthogonal (TDMA) and training-based 2 method as a baseline for comparison. The transmitter com- municates with the two receivers in a time-sharing manner.\nWhen transmitting to the dynamic receiver, it is optimal if the transmitter activates only K out of M antennas, and sends pilots from the K antennas sequentially over the ﬁrst K time- slots. Then, the transmitter sends data during the remaining (T − K) time-slots [6], [8]. The maximum rate achieved by the dynamic receiver is:\nFor the static receiver the channel is assumed to be known at the receiver, therefore data is transmitted to it coherently. The maximum rate achieved by the static receiver is [9]\nmin(M, N 2 ) log ρ + O(1). \t (7) Denote the corresponding degrees of freedom pair with D 2 :\nWe now propose a superposition signaling that attains uniformly higher degrees of freedom than orthogonal trans- mission and the signaling in [1].\nConsider M = N 1 = N 2 = 1 and T = 2. Our approach is that over 2 time-slots, the transmitter sends\nX = x 2 x t 1 ∈ C 1×2 , \t (9) where x 1 = [x (1) 1 x (1) 2 ] t is the signal for the dynamic receiver, which has unit-norm and is from a codebook X 1 ⊂ G(2, 1). The signal x 2 is for the static receiver.\nWe intuitively calculate the degrees of freedom achieved by the two receivers. The signal at the dynamic receiver is\n= ˜h 1 [x (1) 1 x (1) 2 ] + 1 √ ρ [w (1) 1 w (1) 2 ], \t (11) where h 1 is the channel coefﬁcient of the dynamic receiver, and ˜h 1 h 1 x 2 is the equivalent channel coefﬁcient obtained by absorbing the signal of the other receiver into the channel coefﬁcient. The dynamic receiver can determine the row space spanned by x 1 even though ˜h 1 is unknown (but non-zero). The total degrees of freedom conveyed by x 1 is 1 (thus 1 2 per time-slot); this is the maximum degrees of freedom for any strategy under the same number of antennas and coherence time, therefore it is optimal.\n2 \t h 2 x 2 . Because (11) and (13) are equivalent, if the dynamic receiver decodes the subspace of x 1 , so does the static receiver (see Lemma 1 for details), thus the exact signal x 1 is known to the static receiver (recall that each subspace is uniquely represented by a signal matrix). Then, the static receiver removes the interference signal x 1\nwhere ˜ w 2 is the equivalent noise. Since the static receiver knows h 2 , it decodes x 2 and attains the degrees of freedom 1 (thus 1/2 per time-slot).\nTherefore, the proposed scheme attains the maximum 1/2 degrees of freedom for the dynamic receiver, which is the maximum degrees of freedom available to it even if the static receiver were absent. Meanwhile 1/2 degrees of freedom is achieved for the static receiver without penalty to the dynamic receiver. With time sharing between this scheme and D 2 , we attain the degrees of freedom\n(d 1 , d 2 ) = 1 − t 2 , t 2 , \t (15) where t ∈ [0, 1] is a time-sharing factor. Figure 2 shows that this region is uniformly larger than that of the orthogonal transmission. 3\nRemark 1: The key difference between the method pro- posed here and the method in [1] is as follows. The information for the static receiver is carried by the exact value of x 2 , instead of its direction (subspace) as in the Grassmannian superposition, i.e., the signal for the static receiver is carried in the Euclidean space instead of the Grassmannian.\nThe toy example above superimposed two signals, one carrying information in its subspace, and the other in its values. We denote this as Grassmannian-Euclidean superposition,\nwhose generalization is the subject of this subsection. A key feature of this method is that the static receiver decodes and removes the dynamic signal. Due to limited space, we focus on the case of N 1 ≤ N 2 in this paper.\nThe transmitter sends X ∈ C N 2 ×T over a coherence interval T , where N 2 = M, i.e., using N 2 out of M antennas:\nwhere X 1 ∈ C N 1 ×T and X 2 ∈ C N 2 ×N 1 are signals for the dynamic receiver and the static receiver, respectively. The signal X 1 is from a Grassmannian codebook X 1 ⊂ G(T, N 1 ), while X 2 is from a conventional Gaussian codebook X 2 . In the above equation √ T / √ N 1 N 2 is a power normalizing factor.\nWe give a sketch of argument for the degrees of freedom attained by the superposition signaling (16) (for a complete proof see Appendix I). For the dynamic receiver, at high SNR, Y 1 ≈ H 1 X 2 X 1 . When N 1 ≤ N 2 , the equivalent channel H 1 X 2 is an N 1 ×N 1 square matrix with full rank, which does not change the row space of X 1 . Recovering the row space of X 1 produces (T − N 1 )N 1 degrees of freedoms (see (4)).\nFor N 1 ≤ N 2 , H 2 = H 2 X 2 is a tall matrix that has full column rank (with probability 1), and does not change the row space of X 1 . Hence, the signal intended for the dynamic receiver can be decoded by the static receiver. After recovering the subspace spanned by X 1 , the codeword itself is known as it is the unique representation for this subspace in the codebook X 1 . Then, X 1 is peeled off from the static signal:\nBecause H 2 is known by the static receiver, Eq. (18) repre- sents an ordinary point-to-point MIMO channel, and therefore N 2 N 1 degrees of freedom can be communicated via X 2 to the static receiver (over T time-slots) [9].\nAltogether, the Grassmannian-Euclidean superposition at- tains the degrees of freedom pair D\nTheorem 1 (N 1 ≤ N 2 ): An M-antenna transmitter broad- casts to a dynamic receiver and a static receiver with N 1 and N 2 antennas, respectively, where the coherence time of the dynamic channel is T . The Grassmannian-Euclidean superposition achieves the rate pair\nThe degrees of freedom pair is given by D. Together with the two points D 1 , D 2 , the achievable degrees of freedom region consists of the convex hull of D 1 , D 2 and D.\nWith the Grassmannian-Euclidean superposition, the static receiver attains the following gain compared with orthogonal transmission:\nWe plot the degrees of freedom region in Figure 3. For relatively small T or large N 2 , the degrees of freedom gain is signiﬁcant. For example, at T = 4, the proposed method achieves a degrees of freedom 2 for the static receiver while attaining the maximum degrees of freedom 1 for the dynamic receiver. As T increases the gain over orthogonal transmission decreases. In the limit T → ∞, we have ΔR 1 = O(1), and the degrees of freedom gain of Grassmannian-Euclidean superpo- sition goes away. The Grassmannian-Euclidean superposition also provides signiﬁcant gain over the method in [1]\nNow, we prove the optimality of the proposed signaling. Consider an upper (coherent) bound of the degrees of freedom region, where both the two receivers have CSIR. In this coherent case, the degrees of freedom region is [3]\n≤ 1. \t (22) One can verify that the degrees of freedom region in Theo- rem 1 reaches the boundary of (22) except for d 1 > N 1 (1 − N 1 /T ). However, the degrees of freedom of the dynamic receiver can never exceed N 1 (1 − N 1 /T ) (see Section II), therefore, Grassmannian-Euclidean superposition achieves the optimal degrees of freedom.\nIn this paper, we proposed Grassmannian-Euclidean su- perposition based on a multiplicative structure, which uses coherent signaling for the receiver with CSIR, and Grassman- nian signaling for the receiver without CSIR. The proposed signaling achieves uniformly higher degrees of freedom than TDMA and the method in [1], and is shown to attain the\noptimal degrees of freedom region as long as the static receiver has no less antenna than the dynamic receiver.\nThe idea of proving achievability is similar to [1, Theorem 1], so we only outline key results without details.\nWe now establish a lower bound for the mutual information between X 1 and Y 1 :\nOne can verify that given X 1 , the autocorrelation of y 1i is E[y \u2020 1i y 1i |X 1 ] = T N\n1 ρ\nA lower bound for h(Y 1 ) can be calculated following steps similar to the proof of [1, Theorem 1], thus the details are omitted. The lower bound is given by:\nh(Y 1 ) > log |F(T, N 1 )| + E[log J X 1 ], \t (28) where the expectation is with respect to H 1 and X 2 , and\n. \t (29) Combining (27) and (28), and normalizing over T time-slots\nleads to the achievable rate of the dynamic receiver. B. Achievable Rate for the Static Receiver\nThe received signal at the static receiver is Y 2 ∈ C N 2 ×T Y 2 = T N\nThe static receiver needs to decode the dynamic receiver\u2019s sig- nal and then remove this interference. We ﬁnd the decodable dynamic rate at the static receiver in the next lemma.\nLemma 1: The static receiver is able to decode the signal for the dynamic receiver if the dynamic rate R 1 satisﬁes\nProof: Use SVD for H 2 , that is H 2 = U \u2020 2 Σ 2 V 2 , where Σ 2 = diag[λ 1 · · · λ N 2 ] with |λ 1 | ≥ · · · ≥ |λ N 2 |. Re-write the signal at the static receiver as\nBecause X 2 is an isotropically distributed unitary matrix, X 2 V 2 X 2 has the same distribution as X 2 , i.e., a matrix of i.i.d. CN (0, 1). Rotate Y 2 with U 2\nwhere the equivalent noise W 2 remains i.i.d. CN (0, 1). Let Y 2 ∈ C N 1 ×T be the ﬁrst N 1 rows of Y 2 , i.e., the rows corresponding to the largest N 1 singular modes of H 2 , that is |λ 1 | ≥ · · · ≥ |λ N 1 |. We denote the corresponding N 1 × N 1 sub-matrix of X 2 by X 2 . Then,\nwhere y 2i is the row i of Y 2 . Let x 2i be the row i of X 2 , for 1 ≤ i ≤ N 1 . Since X 2 ∈ C N 1 ×N 1 have i.i.d. CN (0, 1) entries, all the row vectors x 2i have the same autocorrelation I N 1 .\n1 ρ\nSince X 1 ∈ C T ×N 1 is unitary, the eigenvalues of X \u2020 1 X 1 are 1, · · · , 1\nh(y 2i |X 1 , H 2 ) ≤ log det λ 2 i X \u2020 1 X 1 + 1 ρ I T \t (39) = N 1 log λ 2 i + 1 ρ − (T − N 1 ) log ρ. (40)\n(i − 1)! , (43) and\nE[I(X 1 ; Y 2 |H 2 )] ≥ N 1 (T − N 1 ) log ρ + h(X 1 ) + E[J X 2 ] − E N 1\nTherefore, the transmitter is able to send N 1 (1 − N 1 /T ) degrees of freedom to the dynamic receiver, while ensuring the dynamic signal is decoded at the static receiver. After decoding X 1 , the static receiver removes the interference:\nwhere W 2 ∈ C N 2 ×N 1 is the equivalent noise (i.i.d. CN (0, 1)). So, after removing the interference of the dynamic receiver, the equivalent channel for the static receiver is a point-to-point MIMO channel. With Gaussian input X 2 , we have [9]\nNormalizing I(X 2 ; Y 2 |H 2 ) over T time-slots yields the achievable rate of the static receiver."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"Y. Li"},{"name":"A.
