To obtain higher data rates, the academia and the industry have put great effort to improve the spectral efﬁciency and data throughput of wireless communication systems. However, in many cases, the achievable cell spectral efﬁciency is limited by the inter-cell interference. Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in coordinated multi-point transmission/reception (CoMP), which can substantially mitigate interference and improve the cell- edge user service quality [1], [2]. This is motivated by that the base stations (BSs) jointly process their signals for a user equipment (UE) by exchanging user data and/or channel state information (CSI) via high-speed backhaul links. Such BS cooperation in particular leads to enormous throughput gains as compared to the single-cell processing where the interference (often from other cells) is treated as noise.\nIn recent years, large dimensional random matrix theory (RMT) [3]\u2013[12] as an effective tool is widely used to cir- cumvent various problems in wireless communications. In this paper, we investigate multi-BS cooperative uplink MIMO transmission systems consisting of K UEs and L BSs, respec- tively, equipped with multiple antennas. The channel between UE k and BS l is modeled as the general channel with two- sided spatial correlation and line-of-sight (LOS), where the\nstatistical independent random matrices have independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries (not necessary Gaussian). Using ¯ H l,k denotes deterministic matrix which reﬂect LOS components of the channel, and R l,k and T l,k denote de- terministic nonnegative deﬁnite matrices which, respectively, characterizing the spatial correlation structure at the receiver and transmitter sides separatively. There have been a few results on MIMO capacity analysis utilizing large dimensional RMT [3], [5]\u2013[9], however, the general model studied in this paper has not been considered.\nTo appreciate the generality of our result, we then introduce the related work. Based on the Stieltjes transform method (or the Silverstein-Bai method) [13], a deterministic equivalent to the mutual information was derived in [5] for non-Gaussian channel of the case with K = L = 1. These results were partially generalized to the case that K ≥ 1 and R l,k \u2019s were permitted to be nonnegative deﬁnite, while ¯ H l,k = 0 and T l,k \u2019s are still required to be diagonal in [9]. Clearly, the results of [5] and [9] cannot allow UEs to be equipped with multiple spatially correlated antennas. Using Gaussian tools, Hachem et al. [6] obtained the asymptotic mutual information expressions of Rayleigh fading channels when K = L = 1, in the sense that R l,k \u2019s and T l,k \u2019s are not necessarily diagonal. More recently, Dumont et al. [8] generalized this result to Rician fading channels. However, if the results in [6], [8] are applied directly to the case with K ≥ 1 and L ≥ 1, it requires that T 1,k , . . . , T L,k are simultaneously unitary diagonalizable for every k.\nIn this paper, we aim to obtain the deterministic equiv- alents (e.g., the Stieltjes transform and the ergodic mutual information) of the CoMP-MIMO channel when the statistical independent random matrices are Gaussian distributed using the Gaussian tools. Our results are much more general and can be used to cope with more complex applications. Using the generalized Lindeberg principle [14], we then generalize the deterministic equivalents of the considered random matrices with Gaussian entries to those with non-Gaussian entries. Then, we obtain the asymptotic optimal input covariance by a standard waterﬁlling procedure. Simulations show that the asymptotic capacity is invariant to all types of fading distribution.\nWe consider a CoMP MIMO uplink system with L BSs, la- beled as BS 1 , . . . , BS L , which are equipped with N 1 , . . . , N L antennas respectively, and K UEs, labeled as UE 1 , . . . , UE K , which are equipped with n 1 , . . . , n K antennas respectively. All BSs can cooperate to jointly process user signals via high- speed backhaul links. In this paper, we use the Kronecker model to characterize the spatial correlation of the MIMO channel for each link so that the correlation at a BS and a UE is modeled separately [15]. Speciﬁcally, the channel from UE k to BS l , H l,k ∈ C N l ×n k , can be written as\nwhere R l,k ∈ C N l ×N l and T l,k ∈ C n k ×n k are deterministic nonnegative deﬁnite matrices, which characterize the spatial correlation of the received signals across the antenna elements of BS l and that of the transmitted signals across the antenna elements of UE k respectively, X l,k ≡ [ 1 √ n k X (l,k) ij ] ∈ C N l ×n k consists of the random components of the channel in which the elements {X (l,k) ij } 1≤i≤N l ;1≤j≤n k are i.i.d. complex random variables with zero mean and unit variance, and ¯ H l,k ∈ C N l ×n k is a deterministic matrix corresponding to the LOS of the channel.\nWith the channel given above, we deﬁne the Rician K-factor between UE k and BS l as\nand denote the link gain of the ( l, k)-th pair by P l,k = E H l,k 2 F . We consider the power of the channels:\nTo satisfy the mentioned Rician K-factor and link gain, we follow the standard conventions [7] that R l,k , T l,k , and ¯ H l,k are normalized such that ⎧\n⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩\ntr( T l,k ) = n k , tr ¯ H l,k ¯ H H l,k = κ l,k κ\nIt is noted that κ l,k and P l,k are independent from the matrix dimensions. Therefore, the normalization is valid for all possible correlation patterns and thus does not impose any restriction on practical applications. In addition, the setting implies that the LOS components of some link pairs are allowed to be absent.\nThe mutual information measures the achievable rate of a channel and has been a key metric for performance analysis. Let N \t L l=1 N l and n \t K k=1 n k . For ease of exposition,\n¯ H k \t ¯ H T 1,k · · · ¯ H T L,k T ∈ C N×n k , H [ H 1 , · · · , H K ] ∈ C N×n ,\nThe channel H k represents the joint channel between UE k and the L interconnected multi-antenna APs. Then, the ergodic mutual information of the MIMO channel can be expressed as\nSpeciﬁcally, V B N (σ 2 ) provides a performance metric regard- ing the number of bits per second per Hertz per antenna that can be transmitted reliably over the channel matrices\nIn this paper, we are interested in understanding the ergodic capacity of the interested channel in the asymptotic regime where L, K are ﬁxed and N 1 , · · · , N L , n 1 , . . . , n K all grow to inﬁnity with ratios {β l,k (N ) ≡ N l n k } such that\nFor convenience, we refer to this asymptotic regime simply as N → ∞ in the sequel. Toward this end, using the Shannon transform, we ﬁnd V N (σ 2 ) so that E {V B N (σ 2 ) } − V N (σ 2 ) → 0. In general, the computation of E{V B N (σ 2 ) } relies on time-consuming Monte-Carlo computer simulations, while the deterministic equivalent is a lot easier to compute than E {V B N (σ 2 ) }. Finally, we use V N (σ 2 ) to obtain the asymptotic optimal input covariance matrices that maximize the ergodic mutual information.\nTo get strict mathematical result, we ﬁrst state the assump- tions imposed in the system model.\nX (l,k) ij \u2019s are i.i.d. complex random variables with independent real and imaginary parts such that\nAssumption 2: The family of deterministic matrices {T l,k , R l,k } ∀l,k is deterministic nonnegative deﬁnite. In addition, the spectral norms of R l,k , T l,k , and ¯ H l,k ¯ H H l,k are bounded by a constant, i.e.,\nTo facilitate our expressions, we deﬁne the notation A k that returns the submatrix of A obtained by extracting the ele-\nments of the rows and columns with indices from k−1 i=1 n i +1 to k i=1 n i . Similarly, the notation A l returns the submatrix of A obtained by extracting the elements of the rows and columns with indices from l−1 j=1 N j + 1 to l j=1 N j . Also, we often omit ω when writing Ψ, ˜ Ψ, Φ, ˜ Φ, Φ l , ˜ Φ k , e l,k , ˜e l,k .\nThe following theorem obtains the general results under Assumption 1 and Assumption 2.\nTheorem 1: Let β l,k = N l n k . Under Assumption 2, the deterministic system of the following L × K equations\nΦ = diag(Φ 1 , . . . , Φ L ), \t (9c) ˜ Φ = diag( ˜ Φ 1 , . . . , ˜ Φ K ), \t (9d)\nProof: For ease of understanding, we give an outline of the proof. Our strategy is to show that the deterministic expression of E {m B N } can be found for the Gaussian random matrices and then we prove that the result is also applied for the non-Gaussian distributions.\nLet B N be an N × N matrix obtained from B N in (4) with all X l,k \u2019s replaced by X l,k \u2019s, where X l,k \u2019s are matrices with entries being independent standard Gaussian. Using the Gaussian tools (the integration by part formula and Poincar´e-Nash inequality), we can show that the error term E {m B N } − 1 N tr ( Ψ) a.s. −−→ 0. However, it is difﬁcult to prove directly it. To that end, we employ an intermediate quantity between E {m B N } and 1 N tr ( Ψ) and establish the following two results:\nE {m B N } − 1 N tr( Ξ) a.s. −−→ 0, \t (12) 1\nDue to space limitation, the derivation details and deﬁnition of Ξ are omitted.\nNext, applying the Lindeberg principle [14, Theorem 2], we prove that E {m B N } − E{m B N } a.s. −−→ 0. Together with the result for the Gaussian case, the proof of (10) can be accomplished by noting that\nRemark 1: Theorem 1 is developed under the asymptotic regime where L, K are ﬁxed and {N l , n k }\u2019s all grow to inﬁnity with ﬁxed ratios. For other applications, we would be interested in the cases with ﬁxed {N l , n k }\u2019s while L and K grow to inﬁnity. In this case, the entries of X l,k \u2019s shall be normalized by\nk . Under this setting, the developed theorems are much more general than the result by Hachem et al. in [6, Theorem 2.5] in the sense that R l,k \u2019s and T l,k \u2019s are not necessarily diagonal.\nUsing Theorem 1, we then derive a deterministic equivalent of the ergodic mutual information in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2: Assume that B N follows the hypotheses of Theorem 1. Then, as N → ∞, the Shannon transform of B N satisﬁes\n(16) or equivalently by\n(17) Proof: Based on (10) in Theorem 1 together with the\ndominated convergence theorem, we can prove (15). Then, we show that ∞ σ 2 1 ω − 1 N tr ( Ψ(ω)) dω can be written more explicitly as (16). The details of the proof are similar to that in [12, Theorem 3], and is thus omitted. According to the fact that det ( I + AB) = det (I + BA), we have (17).\nFor the case with L = 1 and ¯ H = 0, V N (σ 2 ) agrees with that in [9, Theorem 3]. Indeed, if ¯ H = 0, (16) was ﬁrst presented in [16, (23)], where the replica method was used. It is known that the replica method is mathematically incomplete. Therefore, Theorem 2 is not only mathematically rigorous but also more general than the proposition in [16] in the sense that ¯ H = 0 and there is no requirement on the Gaussian distribution on the entries of X l,k .\nIt is well known that the ergodic capacity of the MIMO channel is achieved by selecting a proper covariance matrix of input signal [17], [18]. Let Q k be the input covariance matrix of UE k and satisﬁes tr( Q k ) ≤ n k . Deﬁne Q\ndiag ( Q 1 , . . . , Q K ). Then, the ergodic sum capacity of the CoMP-MIMO channel can be expressed as\nTherefore, the ergodic capacity under the power constraint is given by the following expression:\nwhere Q k {Q k |tr(Q k ) ≤ n k and Q k 0} is the feasible set of Q k . The optimization problem (19) is convex and can be solved using stochastic programming based on convex optimization in combination with Monte-Carlo method [19]. However, the main drawback is long execution time for ex- haustive averaging. We thus propose asymptotic programming based on the large-system results in Theorem 2.\nBecause the large-system results are invariant to the type of fading distribution, any designs based on the large-system results are invariant and thus robust. Therefore, the properties of the asymptotic optimal input covariance are invariant to the type of fading distribution. The effect of Q k can be simply involved into V N (σ 2 ) by the following replacements: ⎧\n⎨ ⎩\nNow, let V N (σ 2 , Q 1 , . . . , Q K ) be that obtained from V N (σ 2 ) with T l,k and ¯ H l,k following the above replacements. Using this large-systems results, the maximization problem (19) can be replaced by\nWe notice the fact that V N (σ 2 , Q 1 , . . . , Q K ) is strict con- cavity with respect to Q, and E{V B N (σ 2 , Q ◦ 1 , . . . , Q ◦ K ) } − V N (σ 2 , Q 1 , . . . , Q K ) goes asymptotically to zero, here, ( Q ◦ 1 , . . . , Q ◦ K ) and ( Q 1 , . . . , Q K ) be the maximizers of (19) and (21), respectively.\nEmploying the concave optimal method and the Karush- Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, the optimization problem (21) is equivalent to the following problem\nQ \\k diag ( Q 1 , . . . , Q k−1 , 0, Q k+1 , . . . , Q K ) , (24) F diag (G 1 , . . . , G K ) + ¯ H H Φ(σ 2 ) ¯ H, \t (25)\nIt is well known that the optimization problem (22) can be solved by a standard waterﬁlling procedure. Thus, we get the next proposition\nProposition 1: Let P k = V P k Λ P k U H P k . For each ﬁxed {e l,k } ∀l,k and {˜e l,k } ∀l,k , the eigenvectors of the asymptotic- optimal input covariance Q k coincide with the right singular vectors of matrix P k , i.e.,\nand the eigenvalues are given by Λ Q k = 1 μ\nwhere ( a) + = max {0, a} and μ k is chosen to satisfy the power constraints tr( Q k ) = n k .\nFirst, we compare the analytical result V N (σ 2 ) (16) with the Monte-Carlo simulation results of the ergodic mutual information E V B N (σ 2 ) obtained from averaging over a large number of independent realizations of H. The used simulation settings are based on the following assumptions. First, the spatial correlation and LOS are generated from an arbitrary pattern. Second, X (l,k) ij is assumed to be of the\n(and θ (l,k) I,ij \u2019s) are the phases modeled as i.i.d. uniform ran- dom variables over [0 , 2π], and those W (l,k) R,ij \u2019s (and W (l,k) I,ij \u2019s) are the amplitude fading drawn from a distribution with E (W (l,k) R,ij ) 2 = 1. The typical probability distributions of W (l,k) R,ij include the Rayleigh, Nakagami, and log-normal distributions [20].\nFig. 1 shows the results of E V B N (σ 2 ) and V N (σ 2 ) for K = 2 and L = 2 under different fading distributions. Recall that our derivation is based on the assumption that N l \u2019s and n k \u2019s all grow to inﬁnity. However, we see that V N (σ 2 ) produces very good estimates for E V B N (σ 2 ) even when only a few antenna elements (e.g., N 1 = N 2 = n 1 = n 2 = 2) are located at each UE and antenna set. As expected, when the number of antennas grows large (e.g., N 1 = N 2 = n 1 = n 2 = 8) all curves tend to overlap regardless of the distributions. Thus, the ergodic mutual information in the large-system limit is distributed invariance.\nFinally, we clarify if the input covariance design based on the deterministic equivalent results is robust. For the asymp- totic optimization (21), the iterative alternative algorithm based on the deterministic equivalent results is used. On the other hand, the ﬁnite-size optimization problem (19) is solved by the Vu-Paulraj algorithm [18]. The Vu-Paulraj algorithm is, in fact, based on the barrier method where the average mutual information and their ﬁrst and second derivatives are calculated by Monte-Carlo methods with 10 4 trials. Note that in contrast to the ﬁnite-size optimization, the asymptotic optimization\nis independent from the true distributions of X l,k \u2019s. In Fig. 2, we evaluate E V B N (σ 2 , Q 1 , . . . , Q K ) } when the input covariance matrices are obtained using the deterministic equiv- alent results and the Vu-Paulraj algorithm. As we can see, the asymptotic approach provides indistinguishable results to the Vu-Paulraj algorithm. However, the asymptotic approach enjoys a much lower complexity since no lengthy Monte-Carlo procedures are needed.\nThis paper addressed the general CoMP MIMO channel model with spatial correlation and LOS where the correlation matrices are generally nonnegative deﬁnite and the channel entries are non-Gaussian distributed. Using large dimensional RMT, the asymptotic ergodic mutual information expression and the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices this sys- tem were proposed. We showed that the asymptotic capacity is invariant to all types of fading distribution.\nThis work of J. Zhang, S. Jin, and X. Q.
