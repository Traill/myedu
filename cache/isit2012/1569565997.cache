Two areas that have experienced signiﬁcant progress by using spatial coupling are coding, see [1]\u2013[3] and references therein, and compressive sensing [4]\u2013[7]. But there is also a large literature on a variety of other graphical models and for each of these models the same signiﬁcant improvement in performance has been observed when going from the uncoupled to the coupled model. For a more thorough review, we refer the reader to [3].\nThe above examples all take advantage of the algorithmic opportunities that spatial coupling provides. But there is a second way in which spatial coupling of graphical models can be useful, namely as a proof technique. The idea is to prove a property of the underlying graph in the following way: (i) prove that this property holds for the spatially coupled graph, and (ii), show that the coupled and the uncoupled systems behave in the same way (with respect to this property). Due to the special nature of spatially coupled graphical models, accomplishing step (i), i.e., proving the desired property for the coupled system, is sometimes easier than for the uncoupled one. Before we outline in more detail how we use spatial coupling as a proof technique, let us introduce the underlying problem.\nWe consider the so-called Maxwell conjecture. This con- jecture states that the MAP threshold of an LDPC ensem- ble is equal to its area threshold. The area threshold is, in turn, determined via the so-called BP-GEXIT curve. To keep things simple, consider (l, r)-regular LDPC ensembles. Figure 1 shows the case of the (3, 6)-regular LDPC ensemble when transmission takes place over the BAWGN channel. It is known, see [8, Theorem 3.120], that for regular degree\ndistributions the area threshold is an upper bound on the MAP threshold, but it is more challenging to show a matching lower bound. For a more thorough discussion of this conjecture, we refer the reader to [8]\u2013[10].\nHow can spatial coupling help to prove this conjecture, i.e., to prove the missing lower bound? The idea is simple. It was shown in [3] that both the MAP as well as the BP threshold of spatially coupled ensembes are equal to the area threshold (when the length of the chain and the connection width tend to inﬁnity). Therefore, if we can show that the MAP threshold of coupled ensembles is equal to the MAP threshold of uncoupled ensembles then the Maxwell conjecture will have been conﬁrmed.\nUsing the so called interpolation technique, in the form in- troduced in [11], we show the equality of the MAP thresholds for coupled and uncoupled ensembles for the speciﬁc class of LDPC ensembles with a check-regular degree distribution and a Poisson distribution for the variable nodes. Why do we consider this ensemble? The Poisson nature of the variable degree distribution helps in the proof and so this is a natural ﬁrst case to consider. But there is good reason to believe that the same steps can also be carried through for regular ensembles. Indeed, this is one of the main points slated for future work. Assuming that this can indeed be accomplished, this, together with the results in [3], will give a proof of the Maxwell conjecture for all regular LDPC ensembles and all binary-input memoryless and output-symmetric channels.\nwe remark that the basic idea of using spatial coupling as a technique to prove properties of the underlying component model might be applicable in a much broader context. It remains to be seen whether this program can be carried out successfully in other scenarios such as constraint satisfaction problems, to answer questions such as the existence of phase transitions or to improve upper and lower bounds.\nWe consider coupled low-density parity-check (LDPC) en- sembles, constructed as follows. The variable nodes are dis- tributed at L sites, with N variables at each site. Thus, there are N L variables in total. The sites are indexed by elements of Z L ∆ = Z/LZ, i.e. lie on a periodic chain of size L. The (1 − R)N L parity checks (R is the rate of the code) always involve K variables, and are chosen randomly in the following way. Independently for each parity check, a site z is chosen uniformly at random, and we consider the group of w ∈ {1, . . . , L} consecutive sites that start at site z, namely z, z + 1, . . . , z + w − 1. We call this group (and all wN variables lying at the sites in this group) a window and the ﬁxed parameter w window size. The variables involved in the parity check are chosen independently from each other and uniformly at random from this window. In particular, we will also consider the cases where w = L and w = 1. Note that the random ensemble is completely speciﬁed by the numbers N , L, K, R and w. Occasionally, we will ﬁnd it convenient to think of codes as bipartite graphs, with N L variable nodes, N L(1 − R) check nodes, check node degree K, with an edge between a variable node and a check node if the variable participates in the corresponding parity check.\nEach variable is indexed by the site z to which it belongs and by the position i ∈ {1, . . . , N } within the site. Its value (0 or 1) will be denoted by x z,i and the whole variable assignment by x = (x z,i ). Sometimes it will be useful to work with values +1 and −1, which will be called spins, and so we deﬁne s z,i = (−1) x z,i and accordingly s = (s z,i ). Given a parity check n, we ﬁnd it convenient to denote the variables it is connected to by n 1 , . . . , n K . In this manner, the fact that a variable assignment satisﬁes a parity check n can be written as x n 1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ x n K = 0 (where ⊕ denotes the XOR operation) or in spin language as s n 1 · . . . · s n K = 1. The local code C n corresponding to a parity check n is the set of all assignments that satisfy n; thus, the previous fact can be written also as s ∈ C n . Since a code is determined by its parity checks, we extend this notation to arbitrary graphs G, so C G is the intersection of all the local codewords of the parity checks inside G.\nWe use the LDPC ensemble code to transmit x over a binary memoryless symmetric channel. The output y = (y z,i ) of the channel is used to compute the 1 2 -log-likelihood ratios h = (h z,i ) (we prefer this physics-inspired quantity, since it simpliﬁes a bit our calculations) given by\nh z,i = 1 2\n|x z,i = 0) p(y z,i |x z,i = 1)\nwhere p(y|x) is the channel transition probability. It is easily shown that h is a sufﬁcient statistic, i.e., it offers the same amount of information on the prior x as the output y. For a linear code G, one can easily show that\nWe denote this probability measure, called the Gibbs mea- sure, by µ G , and the average with respect to it by angular brackets · (making the reference to h implicit), in order to simplify notation and distinguish it from other types of averages and expectations that will occur. The expectation with respect to the channel will be denoted by E h and the one with respect to the LDPC ensemble will be of the form E ens , where ens corresponds to the particular ensemble we use. Note that these two expectations commute, since the channel use is independent of the randomness in the ensemble. The denominator that appears in (2) is denoted by Z G , the partition function. The quantity f N,L,w = − 1 N L E ens,h [log Z G ] is the average free energy per node. It is related to the average input-output conditional entropy of the code ensemble h N,L,w = 1 N L E ens [H(X|Y )] by the simple formula (see [12] for a proof)\nand the average entropies (3) satisfy the reversed inequalities. Let us discuss the consequences of this lemma. The ﬁrst\n\u2022 The connected ensemble, if the window size is L. In this case, sites have no relevance, and the interaction between two variables is the same, no matter the position of their sites. Let f N and h N denote the average free energy and entropy of an individual ensemble with N variable nodes, and (1 − R)N check nodes (of degree K) with edges connected independently uniformly at random to the variable nodes. We have f N,L,L = f LN and h N,L,L = h LN .\n\u2022 The ring ensemble, if the window size is w, with 1 < w < L.\n\u2022 The disconnected ensemble, if the window size is 1. There is no interaction between variables at different sites. By construction, the numbers of check nodes at each site are i.i.d. Bi (1 − R)N L, 1 L . Therefore we expect that the average free energy and entropy for this ensemble satisfy f N,L,1 ≈ f N and h N,L,1 ≈ h N up to a correction term O(N −1/2 ) coming from the ﬂuctuations in the number of parity checks at each position. The size of the ﬂuctuations is implied by the observation at the beginning of Section IV.\nThese remarks and Lemma 1 show that f N L ≥ f N,L,w ≥ f N + O(N −1/2 ). An argument showing the existence of the large block length limits then allows to deduce the following.\nLemma 2: For L, R, K, w ﬁxed, with K even, the N → +∞ limits exist, and we have\nNote that since the right hand side does not depend on L we trivially conclude that the extra limit L → +∞ of the left hand side also exists.\nAs explained in the introduction, spatially coupled codes involve open chain constructions. Here we consider the follow- ing construction, which is similar to the one in [2]. Think con- ceptually that sites z are indexed by all integers, and that there are N variable nodes at each site. We have (1−R)N (L+w−1) parity checks that we distribute independently uniformly at random among positions z ∈ {−w + 1, . . . , L − 1}. The K edges of each check at position z are connected independently and uniformly at random to variable nodes in the range {z, . . . , z + w − 1}. Finally erase all variable nodes (together with their edges) that are at positions z < 0 and z ≥ L. Note that the total number of variable nodes is N L. The deﬁnitions of the average free energy and entropy are the same as in the periodic case and these quantities are denoted by f open N,L,w and h open N,L,w . Essentially the open and ring free energies/entropies differ by a boundary term that is O(L −1 ).\nFrom Lemmas 2 and 3 we immediately deduce an important corollary, whose signiﬁcance we brieﬂy discuss.\nImagine that we have a family of BMS channels (say the BEC( ), BSC( ) or the BAWGNC( )) indexed by the noise parameter . Consider the inﬁnite block length entropies on both sides of equality (7) as functions of . The singularities 1 in (or phase transition thresholds) for the spatially coupled open system and individual system are the same in the inﬁnite length limit.\nWe expect that the same equality holds for more general ensembles. This would allow to fully prove the Maxwell construction conjecture [8]. For concreteness take a regu- lar (l, r) individual ensemble. This has a MAP threshold: the entropy vanishes for ∈ [0, (l,r) MAP [ and is positive for\n> (l,r) MAP . Alternatively one may say that its derivative (the MAP-GEXIT function) vanishes for ∈ [0, (l,r) MAP [ and jumps to a positive value at (l,r) MAP . One can deﬁne an area threshold (l,r) area , such that the integral of the BP-GEXIT curve\n(computed by density evolution) over > (l,r) area is equal to the design rate 1 − l r . The Maxwell conjecture states that\n= (l,r) area . Consider now the spatially coupled (l, r, L, w) ensemble, and its corresponding MAP threshold (l,r,L,w) MAP . By analyzing the threshold saturation phenomenon for general BMS channels, Kudekar, Richardson and Urbanke [13] proved\nequality (7) is shown to hold for regular (l, r) degrees, then we can conclude that (l,r) MAP = (l,r) area , in other words the Maxwell conjecture holds. In fact one would presumably obtain a much stronger result: namely that the BP-GEXIT curve is equal to the MAP-GEXIT curve for all > MAP .\nProof of Lemma 1: Two types of ensembles are involved in each of the two inequalities that we have to prove. Let the window sizes of these ensembles, which we call type A and type B, be w A and w B (i.e., either w A = L, w B = w or w A = w, w B = 1). Likewise, if a parity check is drawn using window size w A , we say it is of type A, and if it is drawn using window size w B , we say it is of type type B. We will interpolate between the ensembles of types A and B, by building a chain in the following way: an ensemble of type r (0 ≤ r ≤ (1−R)N L) is one in which r check nodes are drawn using window size w B , and (1 − R)N L − r are drawn using window size A (the type r depends, of course, on what A and B are, but we drop this reference in the interest of brevity). We denote by E A , E B and E r the expectations with respect to the ensembles of type A, B and r, respectively. The claim, expressed as E A,h [− log Z G ] ≥ E B,h [− log Z G ], is implied by monotonicity along the chain, a fact which remains to be proved:\nThe generation of ensembles of type r − 1 and r can be coupled in the following way. The generation is done in two phases. In the ﬁrst phase, generate r − 1 check nodes of type B and (1 − R)N L − r check nodes of type A, which will compose a base ensemble. In the second phase, we add an extra check node to the base ensemble. If we choose it of type A, we obtain an ensemble of type r − 1, whereas by choosing it of type B, we obtain an ensemble of type r.\nSince the ensembles of type r − 1 and r only differ in the last choice made in the second phase, we can ﬁx a particular graph ˜ G of the base ensemble. Then the claim follows if we can prove that\nSince the only randomness that is left from the ensemble generation is in the second phase, i.e., in the choice of one check node n (drawn using window size A and B, respectively), we make it explicit in the following way:\nBy adding E h [log Z ˜ G ] on both sides of the inequality, we obtain\nRewriting Z ˜ G∪n as s 1{s ∈ C ˜ G } 1{s ∈ C n }e h·s , the ratio Z ˜ G∪n /Z ˜ G becomes the average 1{s ∈ C n } s , which can also be expressed as 1 − 1{s ∈ C n } s . In the rest of the proof, angular brackets will denote averaging with respect to the Gibbs distribution corresponding to ˜ G. Then both sides of inequality (11) are of the form\nWriting the logarithm using the power series expansion − log(1 − x) = ∞ l=1 l −1 x l , we get\n1 l\nWe then use the identity 1{s ∈ C n } = 1 2 (1 − s n ), where s n is short for s n 1 · . . . · s n K , and obtain\nl r\nwhere in the second step we have switched the sums. The sums always converge, since s n s > −1, which holds because the transmitted codeword always has nonzero Gibbs measure. The term corresponding to r = 0 can be taken separately, since it is just ∞ l=1 1 l2 l = ln 2. We then use the combinatorial identity\n= l r , which is easily proved by induction on r with the well-known identity l r = l r l−1 r−1 . We get\nWe take a closer look at the part A w ∗ ,r = E n:w ∗ s n 2r s . Consider 2r replicas of s, which we denote by s (1) , . . . , s (2r) , and we write s n 2r s as the product s (1) n\n. To render the computation more intelligible, we will drop the\nindex of the angular brackets, since we will always average over all replicas that appear inside the brackets. We make the randomness in the choice of check node n explicit, and we obtain\nwhere we have used the notation U z = {z} × {1, . . . , n}, U z,w ∗ = w ∗ −1 d=0 U z+d , in order to easily name the set of all variables at a site or in a window of sites. Pushing the sum over the check variables inside the angular brackets, and swapping the sum with the product, we obtain the simpler form\nwhich implies F L, ˜ G ≥ F w, ˜ G ≥ F 1, ˜ G , which in turn proves inequality (11), and thus the claim follows.\nTo prove relations (a) and (b) above, we plug in the values w ∗ = 1, w, L in equation (20). We obtain the following:\n1 L\n1 w\n1 w\nBoth relations (a) and (b) then follow from the convexity of the function f (x) = x K , for even K.\nWe begin with the following observation: adding an extra clause n to a graph ˜ G in an ensemble can only change the quantity E ens,h [− log Z ˜ G ] by at most a constant. This is because the change is in fact E ens F w ∗ , ˜ G , whose absolute value is upper bounded using (17), together with the fact that\ns n s ≤ 1 and the convergence of the series ∞ r=1 \t 1 2r(2r−1) . The ﬂuctuation in the free energy per node caused by an extra clause will then be O 1 N L .\nProof of Lemma 2: We follow the lead of [11] and use some of the arguments of Lemma 1, thus we only provide a proof sketch (however see the remark at the end of the proof). By inspecting the deﬁnition of the free energy, one easily sees that it is bounded uniformly in the system size. Thus, by a standard argument, the existence of the limit (for an individual system) follows from superadditivity, i.e.,\n. (27)\nThe rest of the proof will be concerned with showing (27). We consider ensembles with just two sites (L = 2), but with different amounts N 1 and N 2 of variables at each site (N = N 1 + N 2 ). We will deal with the cases w = 1 (disconnected) and w = 2 (connected). In the case w = 1 when we add a check, we place it with probability p 1 = N 1 /(N 1 + N 2 ) on the ﬁrst site and p 2 = N 2 /(N 1 + N 2 ) on the second. To avoid confusion, we denote by f disc N\nthe free energies per site in the two cases. Then by modifying slightly the proof of Lemma 1, we obtain that f conn N\nWe now identify f N 1 +N 2 with f conn N 1 ,N 2 and we are left to prove that indeed f disc N 1 ,N 2 corresponds to the r.h.s. of (27). Note that if the number of check nodes that are affected to the two sides would be proportional to N 1 and N 2 , then there would be no need for the O(·) term. However, the amounts of check nodes on the two sides are in fact binomial random variables, with standard deviation O(\nN 1 + N 2 ). For each additional or missing check node (of which there are O(\nthe ﬂuctuation is O( 1 N ), and thus the superadditivity relation is fulﬁlled.\nRemark 5: Classical proofs of (27) for spin systems on regular lattices do not work for random graphs. The idea of interpolating between two systems goes back to Guerra and has been applied to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, and constraint satisfaction problems [15], [11]; however it usually leads to subadditivity of the free energy. In the present situation, the proof hinges on channel symmetry - through the use of the Nishimori identity - and leads to superadditivity.\nProof of Lemma 3: The result follows directly from the observation made at the beginning of this section. The amount of check nodes at the ends of the chain is typically O(wN ), and their overall contribution cannot change the free energy per node by more than O(w/L).\nIt is conceptually interesting that one may prove the Maxwell conjecture by going through the route of spatial coupling. As explained in the introduction, the proof will be complete once we extend the present results to (l, r)-regular codes.\nWe brieﬂy mention a slightly different point of view on the whole problem. The BP threshold of the spatially coupled ensemble is an algorithmic lower bound to the MAP threshold of the underlying ensemble (it so happens that this bound is sharp). This suggests to use spatial coupling as a method to obtain good, if not sharp, algorithmic lower bounds for phase transition thresholds in other problems beyond coding theory. We refer the reader to [16] for a more extensive discussion of this point, and for a result analogous to Corollary 4 for random constraint satisfaction problems.\nAcknowlegment.
