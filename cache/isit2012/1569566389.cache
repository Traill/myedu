The previously known best general DoF inner bound, inspired by the K user interference channel, was based on the decomposition of every transmitter and receiver into multiple single antenna nodes, transforming the network into an AM × AN user SISO X network. While such a decomposition is DoF optimal for the K user interference channel, a gap remained between the best inner and outer bound for the MIMO X channel. Here we close this gap with the new insight that the MIMO X network is only one-sided decomposable, i.e., either all the transmitters or all the receivers (but not both) can be decomposed by splitting multiple antenna nodes into multiple single antenna nodes without loss of DoF. The result is extended to SIMO and MISO X networks as well and in each case the DoF results satisfy the spatial scale invariance property.

Taken individually, the understanding of MI- MO is by now quite mature, and rapid advances have recently been made in understanding the essential principles of IA through DoF studies of a variety of network settings. Taken together, however, the understanding of MIMO in conjunction with IA, the understanding of the spatial dimension per se, is limited by a number of unresolved fundamental issues. In particular, here we highlight the issues of spatial scale invariance, decomposability and linear feasibility.\n(1) Spatial Scale Invariance: It is well understood that the DoF of wireless networks are scale-invariant with respect to time and frequency dimensions. Wang et al. have recently\nconjectured in [6] that the spatial dimension is similarly scale invariant: With perfect global channel knowledge and generic channels, if the number of antennas at each node in a wireless network is scaled by a common constant factor, then the DoF of the network (for almost all channel realizations) scale by the same factor.\nThe spatial scale invariance conjecture is consistent with all known DoF results across a wide variety of networks. For the 2 × 2 user MIMO X channel with A antennas at each node, the DoF value is known to be 4A 3 [4], [5], which scales with A and is therefore, consistent with the spatial scale invariance conjecture. Even for the M × N user MIMO X network with A antennas at each node, if min(M, N ) ≤ 2, the DoF value is easily seen to be A \t M N M +N −1 , again spatial scale invariant. However, if min(M, N ) > 2, the best known inner bound for the M × N user X network with A antennas at each node, is only A \t M N M +N − 1\nDoF [3], which is not spatial scale invariant. This remarkable distinction between the min(M, N ) ≤ 2 setting and the min(M, N ) > 2 setting is mainly because in the former setting the achievability schemes are based on regular (non-asymptotic) linear schemes, whereas in the latter setting the asymptotic CJ scheme of [2] is used. Note that while most achievability schemes based on regular beamforming naturally scale with the spatial dimension, the asymptotic CJ scheme of [2] does not.\nAs the ﬁrst contribution of this work, we establish that for all M, N , the M ×N user MIMO X network with A antennas at each node, has A \t M N M +N −1 DoF. Additionally, we verify that the spatial scale invariance property is also valid for SIMO and MISO X networks as well.\n(2) Decomposability: We use the term \u201cdecomposition\u201d to refer to independent processing at each antenna, essentially splitting a multiple antenna node into multiple independent single antenna nodes. It was ﬁrst used to simplify the proof of achievability in the K user symmetric MIMO interference channel [2] where the DoF result obtained for the SISO setting was immediately extended to the symmetric MIMO setting by decomposing the K user MIMO interference network with A antennas at each node, into an AK user SISO interference network, where the asymptotic CJ alignment scheme can be applied to show that AK/2 DoF are achievable, without joint\nprocessing among co-located antennas at any node. Since AK/2 is also the DoF outer bound for the K user symmetric MIMO interference network, it is evident that the network is decomposable, i.e., no loss of DoF results from decomposing all transmitters and receivers.\nThe previously best known inner bound for the symmetric MIMO X network is also based on the decomposition argu- ment and application of the asymptotic CJ alignment scheme. By decomposing every transmitter and receiver in an M × N user symmetric MIMO X network with A antennas at each n- ode, we obtain an AM ×AN user symmetric SISO X network, and therefore the corresponding DoF value, A \t M N M +N − 1\nis achievable. Unfortunately, in the X network setting, this inner bound did not match the best known outer bound and therefore, the optimal DoF value remained open. The key to solving this open problem in this paper, is the new insight that unlike symmetric MIMO interference networks which are two- sided decomposable (i.e., one can decompose all transmitters and all receivers without loss of DoF), symmetric MIMO X networks are only one-sided decomposable (i.e., one can decompose either all transmitters, or all receivers, but not both, without loss of DoF). While our achievability scheme is still based on the asymptotic CJ alignment scheme of [2], we use the extension by Gou and Jafar in [7], of the CJ scheme to SIMO/MISO settings.\n(3) Linear Feasibility: Linear feasibility refers to the achievability of interference alignment in a network based only on spatial beamforming, i.e., without symbol extensions. Starting in the context of interference networks, [9] formulated the problem as the solvability of a set of multivariate polyno- mial equations. In [9], the authors deﬁne an IA problem as improper or proper based on whether or not the number of equations exceeds the number of involved variables, with the conjecture that proper systems are likely to be feasible and improper systems are likely to be infeasible. This conjecture is recently settled completely in one direction and partially in the other direction [10], [11]. In particular, it is shown that in interference channel setting improper systems are infeasible. In this work, we extend this result into MIMO X setting. Following the approach of [10], [11], we establish that in arbitrary (not limited to symmetric) MIMO X networks, the improperness of polynomial system implies infeasibility of linear IA as well. A challenging aspect of this contribution is the derivation of the improperness condition itself, because the variable counting argument is a bit more involved in the X setting than in interference channels.\nAn M × N user MIMO X network is a single-hop com- munication network with M transmitters and N receivers, where transmitter i has message W [ji] for receiver j, for each i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , M }, j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N }. Transmitter i has A i antennas and receiver j has B j antennas. The M × N user\nwhere κ represents the channel use index, X [i] (κ) is the A i ×1 input signal vector of the i th transmitter, Y [j] (κ) is the B j × 1 output signal vector of the j th receiver and Z [j] (κ) represents the B j × 1 additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector at the j th receiver. The average power at each transmitter is bounded by ρ and the noise variance at all receivers is assumed to be equal to unity. H [ji] (κ) represents the B j × A i channel matrix between transmitter i and receiver j at channel index κ. We assume that all channel coefﬁcient values are time-varying, i.i.d., drawn from a continuous distribution and the absolute value of all the channel coefﬁcients is bounded between a non-zero minimum value and a ﬁnite maximum value. Perfect knowledge of all channel coefﬁcients is available to all transmitters and receivers. Let R ji (ρ) = R(ρ) denote the symmetric achievable rate for each message where ρ is referred to as the Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Then the DoF for message W [ji] is deﬁned as d ji = lim ρ→∞ R ji (ρ)/ log(ρ), which can be interpreted as independent signaling dimensions or streams. We use d to denote the symmetric DoF and the sum DoF is given by η \t j,i d ji .\nThe main result is presented in the following two theorems. Theorem 1: The M × N user MIMO X network with A\nTo grasp the essence of the achievable scheme, let us provide an intuitive overview with a simple example. Consider the 3 × 3 MIMO X network with 2 antennas at each node, i.e., M = N = 3, A = 2, as shown in Figure 1. We split all the transmit antennas and view them as 6 independent trans- mitters. Each virtual transmitter selects the same beamforming matrices (thereby same signal space) V a , V b , V c for receiver a, b, c, respectively, over n symbol extensions. Then the signal space seen by each receiver has 2n dimensions. In order to consolidate the interference caused by V a at receiver b, c as much as possible and because any two transmitters cannot align with each other, we turn to many-to-many alignment\nscheme in which transmitter 1, 2 occupy 2|V a | dimensional interference space and all the remaining undesired signals from transmitter 3 to 6 are incorporated into these 2|V a | dimensions. Set the interference space brought by V a at receiver b, c to V a × V a , i.e., the column span of the matrix\nwhere T ji denote the interference-carrying matrices (same as H [ji] in the ﬁgure). We use T ji , j = 3, 4, 5, 6 here to highlight they are all the interfering links arriving at receivers b, c caused by V a (red and black links shown in Figure 1). All the above conditions can be satisﬁed with the CJ alignment scheme [1]:\nSimilarly, the three messages for receiver b are sent along the same signal space V b and align into the same space V b × V b at receivers a, c where they constitute interference. Lastly, V c × V c span the total interference space by the messages intended for receiver c at a, b. The size of the signal spaces are chosen to be equal, i.e., |V a | = |V b | = |V c | = |V| and then |V × V| = 2|V|. We can easily see that at each receiver, desired signals occupy 6|V| dimensions from all 6 transmitters and interference (namely signals intended for the other two receivers) occupies 4|V| dimensions. After aligning the interference, we need to guarantee the linear independence of desired signals from interference to ensure decodability, which is proved in the full paper [12]. Finally, in order to accommodate all the signals in general positions in the 2n dimensional signal space at each receiver, we set 10|V| = 2n. The total accessible DoF for the network equal 3×6|V| n = 18 5 = A \t M N M +N −1 , as desired.\nThe statement of Theorem 1 can be further generalized as in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 2: The M × N user SIMO X network with a single antenna at each transmitter and R antennas at each receiver, as well as its reciprocal channel, the N × M MISO X network, has\nDoF. In addition, the DoF in both cases satisfy the spatial scale invariance property.\nNote that Theorem 1 is a special case of Theorem 2 when R = 1 and the scaling factor is speciﬁed by A.\nWhen considering linear IA without symbol extension, we assume transmitter i intends to send d ji independent streams to receiver j using a precoding matrix V [ji] of dimension A i × d ji . Then receiver j zero-forces all the interference while keeping all the desired signals with a receive ﬁlter matrix U [j] of dimension B j × i d ji . The IA solution requires the simultaneous satisﬁability of the following conditions:\nwhere i ∈ {1, 2, ...M }, j, k ∈ {1, 2, ...N }. A \u2020 denotes the conjugate transpose of the matrix A, and [A, B] represents horizontal concatenation of matrices A and B. The IA con- dition (6) implies that V [ji] and U [j] must have full column rank.\nIt is well known that linear IA schemes should satisfy reciprocity [8]. In the reciprocal network, the direction of com- munication is switched, and transmitter j intends to send ˜ d ij = d ji DoF to receiver i. The precoding ﬁlter ˜ V [ij] is obtained by splitting U [j] , i.e., U [j] = [ ˜ V [1j] , ˜ V [2j] , ..., ˜ V [M j] ], where ˜ V [ij] is a B j × d ji matrix. The receiving ﬁlter ˜ U [i] at receiver i is [V [1i] , V [2i] , ..., V [N i] ] with dimension A i × j d ji . Then the linear IA feasibility conditions in the reciprocal network are\nwhere i, l ∈ {1, 2, ...M }, j ∈ {1, 2, ...N }, and ˜ H [ij] denotes the reciprocal channel from transmitter j to receiver i. Also (8) requires that ˜ V [ij] and ˜ U [i] are full column rank.\nRemark: Note the subtle but essential difference between the MIMO interference channel and MIMO X network, evident in the asymmetric form of the feasibility conditions (5) (6) where only one ﬁlter matrix U [k] is associated with a receiver and accounts for all received messages, but multiple precod- ing matrices V [ji] are associated with each transmitter, one corresponding to each message originating at that transmitter. Similarly, in the reciprocal network, at receiver i multiple precoding matrices V [ji] in the original network are combined into one receiving ﬁlter ˜ U [i] , and the receiving ﬁlter U [j] in the original network are split into multiple matrices as the new precoding matrices ˜ V [ij] .\nTheorem 3: In the M × N user symmetric MIMO X network where each transmitter is equipped with A and each receiver is equipped with B antennas, every transmitter intends to send d DoF to every receiver. If a feasible linear IA solution exists, the symmetric DoF d must satisfy\nRemark: The result can be shown for arbitrary antenna conﬁgurations, without any symmetry assumptions, but is stated here for the symmetric setting where it can be expressed in a compact form. The result essentially states that improper systems are infeasible. The proof is virtually identical to [10], [11].\nNote that since we are only making a claim about \u201cin- feasibility\u201d we can over count the variables and still have a valid, albeit less interesting, result. We will, however, check if our threshold is tight through some examples. Note from the recently solved 3 user MIMO interference channel, that the settings with no redundancy (where neither A nor B can be reduced without losing DoF) are those ones where the feasibility condition matches the information theoretic DoF value.\nExample to Check Tightness of Threshold Value: Consider a 2 × 2 user X channel, where each transmitter is equipped with 2 antennas and each receiver is equipped with 3 antennas. We already know that d = 1 is tight here, i.e. information theoretically there is no redundancy on either side (details will be shown in the full paper [12]). Also the threshold value from our bound (9) is 2+3 2×2+1 = 1. This is a good sanity check that our improper condition is not loose, i.e., the variables are not being over-counted. More generally, in a 2×K user MIMO X network, where each transmitter is equipped with K antennas and each receiver is equipped with K + 1 antennas, we also know d = 1 is tight and there is no redundant dimension. Again our bound (9) K+K+1 2K+1 = 1 is tight as well.\nWe only need to prove Theorem 2 which includes Theorem 1 as a special case, as stated before.\nThe M × N user SIMO X network with a single antenna at each transmitter and R antennas at each receiver is considered. The proof for its reciprocal the N × M MISO X network follows from the same line. Additionally, the outer bound for the scaling network could be seen easily.\nProof: When M ≤ R, the DoF value for the X network is bounded by the total number of transmit antennas M , which is simply the single-user DoF bound.\nWhen M > R: If we allow full cooperation among the ﬁrst R transmitters, then it is equivalent to the X network with M − R + 1 transmitters, the ﬁrst transmitter equipped with R antennas and all the other transmitters equipped with single antenna each, and N receivers, each equipped with R antennas. In [3], it is shown that in X network, the number of DoF achieved by all the messages associated with transmitter m or receiver n is upper bounded by max(A t m , B r n ), where A t m and B r n stand for the number of antennas at the transmitter m and receiver n, respectively. Since allowing cooperation among transmitters does not hurt the capacity, the number of DoF achieved by all the messages associated with the ﬁrst R\ntransmitters and the receiver n is no more than max(R, R) = R. This gives us the outer bound\nRepeating the arguments for every R transmitters and each receiver n, we arrive at the outer bound of the SIMO X network\nThe achievability of Theorem 1 consists of two parts. The ﬁrst part is to design a concrete scheme to achieve the DoF for the SIMO and reciprocal MISO X network, and the second part is to prove the spatial scale invariance property. We will prove both one by one.\nProof: When M ≤ R, beamforming and zero forcing are sufﬁcient to achieve the DoF.\nIn the SIMO case, as each receiver has enough antennas to decode all desired messages by zero forcing the interference from unintended transmitters and messages, each transmitter can achieve its interfering-free 1 DoF, resulting in a total of M DoF for the network. In the reciprocal MISO case, each receiver can also achieve 1 DoF by zero-forcing all the interference at the transmitter.\nWhen M > R, the achievable scheme is based on separating the antennas at one side and interference alignment. Due to the reciprocity of linear beamforming-based alignment, which states that if interference alignment is feasible on the original network then it is also feasible on the reciprocal network, and the achievable DoF are the same between the dual networks [3], [8], we only consider the SIMO case. Following the same intuition from the former example, consider an n symbol ex- tension of the original channel and each transmitter possesses an n-dimensional signal space while every receive space has nR dimension. With CJ alignment scheme, all signals intended for receiver i, can be aligned into a subspace whose dimension is vR at any receiver other than i, where v is the number of dimensions used by each transmitter inside the total n dimensional signal space. Consider the aligned interference at receiver 1, it consists of N − 1 signals which are desired at receiver 2, 3, . . . N , respectively. Then the DoF obtained at receiver 1 equal \t M v M v+(N −1)vR for M independent messages. By symmetry, the total DoF for all the M N messages in the network are \t M N M +(N −1)R , as expected. Due to space limitation, detailed mathematical proof as well as the proof for the independence between desired signals and interference are relegated to the full paper [12].\nWe now proceed to the second part, i.e, scale the number of antennas at each node by A times and prove the DoF also scale A times. When M ≤ R, the achievable scheme follows directly as before, i.e., the DoF multiply by A. When\nM > R, we only need to consider the A times SIMO case as the reciprocity still holds. Suppose we view each transmitter with A antennas as A different users with single antenna and one message to transmit to each of the N receivers. In other words, we do not allow joint processing of signals among A antennas at each transmitter. Then we obtain an AM × N user SIMO X network with a single antennas at each transmitter and AR antennas at each receiver rather than an M × N user MIMO X network with A antennas at each transmitter and AR antennas at each receiver. By the result of SIMO X netwrok,\n= A \t M N R M +N R−R DoF can be achieved, which is exactly A times of the corresponding SIMO network. Note that from the view of one-sided decomposability of this A times multiple SIMO X network, we separate the transmit antennas which are less than the number of receive antennas as 1 < R trivially. This is a general rule, i.e., in an asymmetric MIMO X network, separating the side with less antennas would result in a higher DoF.\nIn Section IV, it is shown that to achieve linear IA in MIMO X network, (5) and (6) should be satisﬁed simultaneously. In our channel model, we assume that general MIMO channels have no structure, and the precoding and receiving ﬁlters have full column rank. Therefore, (6) is satisﬁed automatically. Then due to the duality between the original channel and the reciprocal channel, in the following proof of Theorem 3, we only consider condition (5), i.e., U [k]\u2020 H [ki] V [ji] = 0, ∀j = k.\nProof: The proof of Theorem 3 consists of two steps. First we derive the properness conditions for the symmetric DOF d in MIMO X network, then we prove that in MIMO X network, improper implies infeasible.\nSimilar to interference channel [9], we can obtain the total number of scalar equations in (5) as\nWhen counting the variables in (5), we need to remove the superﬂuous variables that do not help with IA. At the receiver, according to [9], for the matrix U [k] , we can ﬁnd one invertible matrix P [k] with dimension i d ki × i d ki satisfying\nwhere ˆ U [k] is a (B k − i d ki ) × i d ki matrix. It is easy to argue that the linearly independent columns of U [k] and those of U [k] P [k]−1 span the same space, and the latter are the basis with the fewest variables for such space. Similarly, for the matrix V [ji] , we can ﬁnd one invertible matrix Q [ji] of dimension d ji × d ji\nTherefore, after removing the superﬂuous variables, the total number of variables is\nIn the symmetric system described in Section IV, according to (12) and (15), the total number of equations and variables are\nN e = M 2 N d 2 (N − 1) \t (16) N v = M N d[A + B − (M + 1)d] \t (17)\nThe ﬁnal step, proving that in MIMO X network improper systems are infeasible, uses transcendental ﬁeld extension theory. Since it is virtually identical to [11] where the same conclusion is obtained for the K user MIMO interference channel setting, the proof is relegated to the full paper [12].\nIn this work, we investigate the DoF of MIMO X networks. We establish that the DoF of SIMO and MISO X networks follow the spatial scale invariance property. In the achievable scheme, we reveal a one-sided decomposability property for these X networks. In addition, we further explore the feasi- bility for linear IA based only on spatial beamforming, and prove that improper systems are infeasible."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S.
