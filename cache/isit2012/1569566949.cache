Until recently it was believed that in multi-cellular LSAS, even in the asymptotic regime, as the number of service antennas tends to inﬁnity, the performance is limited by directed inter-cellular interference. The interference results from unavoidable re-use of reverse-link pilot sequences (pilot contamination) by terminals in different cells.\nWe devise a new concept that leads to the effective elimi- nation of inter-cell interference in TDD LSAS systems. This is achieved by outer multi-cellular pre-coding, which we call pilot contamination pre-coding (PCP). The main idea of PCP is that each base station linearly combines messages aimed to terminals from different cells that re-use the same pilot sequence. Crucially, the combining coefﬁcients depend only on the slow- fading coefﬁcients between the terminals and the base stations. Each base station independently transmits its PCP-combined symbols using conventional linear pre-coding that is based on estimated fast-fading coefﬁcients. Further we derive estimates for SINRs and a capacity lower bound for the case of LSASs with PCP and ﬁnite number of antennas M ."},"body":{"text":"The exponential increase in demand for high data rates, as well as the higher user density in cellular networks require new ways of mitigating interference allowing a larger number of users to share bandwidth. This, along with the Green Touch initiative to decrease the power consumption in communica- tions networks, motivates the analysis of cellular systems with a very large number of base station (BTS) antennas. Such systems have been studied extensively.\nIn [5], [1] the authors derived estimates for SINR values in a non-cooperative cellular network in which the number of BTS antennas tends to inﬁnity. It is shown in [5], [1], that not all interference vanishes, and therefore, SINR does not grow indeﬁnitely. The reason is that the channel estimates made at the BTS contain not only the desired channel vector and additive white noise, but also components directed towards users from other cells who are assigned non-orthogonal pilot sequences.\nA number of techniques were proposed for achieving higher SINRs. The numerical results obtained in [5], [1], [2] show that these techniques provide breakthrough data transmission rates for noncooperative cellular networks. Advanced network- MIMO TDD systems that allow some collaboration between\nbase stations were proposed recently in [3]. Unfortunately, in all these techniques SINR values remain ﬁnite and do not grow indeﬁnitely with the number of base station antennas M .\nIn this paper we allow a limited collaboration between base stations and propose an outer multi-cellular pre-coding, which we call pilot contamination pre-coding. In the asymptotic regime, as M tends to inﬁnity, this precoding allows us to construct interference free multi-cell wireless systems. We further proceed with analysis of LSASs with ﬁnite M .\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, in Section II, we describe our system model, assumptions, and TDD protocol. Then, in Section III, we explain the pilot contamination problem and show that the pilot contamination results in inter- cell interference that does not vanish as the number of base station antennas M is growing. In Section IV we propose the pilot contamination precoding and show that it allows achieving interference free TDD LSASs. Finally, in Section V we derive estimates for SINRs and a capacity lower bound for the case of LSASs with PCP and ﬁnite number of antennas M .\nWe consider a cellular network composed of L hexagonal cells, each consisting of a central M -antenna base station and K single-antenna terminals that share the same bandwidth. We assume that Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is used. Consequently, we consider a ﬂat-fading channel model for each OFDM subcarrier. For a given sub- carrier we denote by\nthe channel (propagation) coefﬁcient between the m-th an- tenna of the i-th BTS and the k-th terminal of the l-th cell, Fig. 1. The ﬁst factor in (1) is the fast fading coefﬁcient h mikl ∼ CN (0, 1). The second factor in (1) is slow fading coefﬁcient (log normal and geometric decay). Coefﬁcients β ikl are constant with respect to frequency and BTS antenna index.\nThe channel coefﬁcients of the i-th base station form the channel vector g ikl = (g 1ikl , g 2ikl , . . . , g M ikl ) ∈ C 1×M , and the corresponding fast fading coefﬁcients form fast fading vec- tor h ikl = (h 1ikl , h 2ikl , . . . , h M ikl ) ∈ C 1×M . We assume that fading coefﬁcients are i.i.d. and therefore h ikl ∼ CN (0, I M ).\nWe further assume that the fast fading channels of different terminals are statistically independent.\nWe assume a time block fading model. Thus fast fading vectors h ikl stay constant during coherence intervals of T OFDM symbols. These vectors are assumed to be independent in different coherence blocks.\nWe assume reciprocity between uplink and downlink chan- nels, i.e. that β ikl and h mikl are the same for these channels.\nLet us consider a Time-Division Duplexing (TDD) scheme, Fig. 2. Each coherence interval is organized in four phases:\n\u2022 second, all terminal synchronously send pilot sequences of length τ ;\n\u2022 base stations use these pilots to estimate the correspond- ing channel vectors and use the obtained estimates for maximum ratio combining processing of the uplink data\n\u2022 base stations transmit downlink data to their terminals using the channel estimates as beamforming vectors;\nBelow we describe details of this protocol for downlink transmission. We assume that K terminals located in the same sell use orthogonal pilots. The maximum number of orthogonal τ -tuples is τ , therefore K ≤ τ . The coherence intervals of fast moving terminals are short, typically T ∈ [4, 30]. So τ should be small. Therefore users in the neighboring cells unavoidably use nonorthogonal pilots, or reuse the same pilots. We assume that in all cells the same set ψ 1 , . . . , ψ τ of orthogonal pilots (ψ i ψ \u2020 j = δ ij ) is used. While not optimal, this choice completely eliminates intra-cell interference as M → ∞, as we detail below.\nThe k-th terminals in all cells synchronously send ψ k . The i-th base station receives the M × τ matrix\nwhere z i ∈ C M ×K is the additive noise. Without loss of generality, we assume that the entries of z i are i.i.d. CN (0, 1) random variables and that all gains are scaled accordingly.\nThe i-th base station estimates the vectors g iki for terminals located in the same cell as ˆ g iki = Y i · ψ \u2020 k / √ τ ρ r , k = 1, . . . , K, which results in\nI M ). The estimate (3) is contaminated, as it involves the channel vectors of users from different cells that use pilot ψ k .\nThe base station uses the estimates ˆ g iki for computing precoding beamforming vectors. For M → ∞ it is convenient to use conjugate beam-forming deﬁned by\nw ki = ˆ g \u2020 iki . \t (4) With this precoding the base station transmits with the power ρ f ||ˆ g iki || 2 , which varies from one coherent interval to another. For transmitting with a constant power the base station should use normalized beamforming vector:\nAfter computing vectors w ki BTS transmits from its M antennas the vector\nThe analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the SINR was conducted in [5] for the precoding deﬁned in (4) and in [1] for precoding (5). Below we summarize the obtained results.\nWe assume precoding (5). The following well known Lemma will be useful for us.\nLemma 1. Let x, y ∈ C M ×1 be two independent vectors with distribution CN (0, c I). Then\nUsing the fact that the channel vectors of different terminals are independent, and applying the above lemma, we can derive the asymptotic behavior of α 2 ki :\nDenote the terms in the double sum of (6) by Q k l and let S k l = |Q k l | 2 . Again using Lemma 1, we obtain\n, k = k, 0, \t k = k.\nIn (6) S ki is the signal power and all other terms S k l , contribute to interference. From (9) we see that only the terminals that use the same pilot ψ k create interference that does not vanish as M → ∞. The reason for this is that the beamforming vectors of these terminals contain components directed towards the k-th terminal in the i-th cell generating directed interference that does not vanish as M → ∞. The variance of the additive noise, however, is unitary regardless of the number of BTS antennas, thus rendering the effect of the noise null in the asymptotic region.\nEquations (8) and (9) deﬁne the asymptotic behavior of the numerator an denominator of the SINR, which are formed of independent variables. Therefore, we have the following theorem (analysis for uplink is similar).\nTheorem 1. [5] [1] The downlink SINR of the k-th terminal in the i-th cell for precoding (4) is\nThe SINR values from Theorem 1 can be improved by different techniques (for instance, we can allow different transmit powers ρ f,l ; their optimization gives a signiﬁcant gain in SINRs [1]). In all these techniques, however, the SINRs do not grow with M . One may try to use network MIMO approach for canceling the inter-cell interference. Network MIMO, however, is based on the assumption that the base stations send to each other estimates ˆ g ikl , which is not feasible in LSAS systems.\nOne possible conclusion of these arguments can be that in both noncooperative LSASs and LSASs with cooperation SINRs do not grow with M beyond certain limits. Below we show that this conclusion is wrong. We demonstrate that a limited collaboration between base stations allows us to radically resolve the pilot contamination problem and to construct interference free LSASs.\nWe make the following assumption on collaboration be- tween base stations.\n\u2022 First, we assume that all signals q ki are accessible to all base stations across the entire network.\n\u2022 Second, we assume that the slow fading coefﬁcients β ikl can be accurately estimated and made available to all base stations or alternatively to a network hub.\nRemark We assume that q ki and β ikl are accessible across the entire network only to obtain a simple theoretical model. In a real system it will be enough if q ki and β ikl are available only to a limited number of cell neighboring the i-th cell.\nWe would like to point out that the slow fading coefﬁcients β ikl are easy to estimate since they are constant over the M antennas, frequency, and over many time slots. In a typical system with 20MHz bandwidth and the useful symbol duration of 2/3 × 100 microseconds there are about 1400 tones per OFDM symbol. We assign to each terminal a dedicated OFDM tone. The terminals transmit pilots of duration 1 (for instance ψ kl = 1 for all k and l), simultaneously in the assigned tones. The i-th base station receives in the appropriate tone: y i = √\nβ ikl h ikl ψ kl , and computes the estimate as ˆ β ikl = 1 M y \u2020 i y i . It is easy to see that\nSo we need only one OFDM symbol for getting these esti- mates. Terminals that are located in remote cells can reuse the same OFDM tone. If this separation is not enough the terminals may use orthogonal pilots ψ kl of length n. In this case the same estimation procedure can be applied and only every (1400 × n)-th terminal will be reusing the same pilot.\nNow we re-examine equation (6). Instead of treating the terms Q kl as interference and estimating their powers, we look at the terms themselves:\n√ ρ f √\nFrom the above expression and (9 we get 1 √\n(14) Let us denote\n \n \n \n \n \nβ 1k1 /α k1 . . . β Lk1 /α kL .. . \t .. .\n \nThen from (28) we have 1 √\nNow we can describe the pilot contamination precoding. Downlink PCP\nThe i-th base station estimates the slow fading coefﬁcients β ikl , k = 1, . . . , K; l = 1, . . . L, and transmits them to the network hub (alternatively to all other base stations).

An exchange of M dimensional vectors is not required (opposite to the network MIMO).\nLet us consider now the uplink transmission. Let the k-th user in the l-th cell transmit s kl . The i-th base station receives\nTo decode the signal s ki the base station applies Maximum Ratio Combining by multiplying the received signal y i by the scaled channel estimate from (3) and obtains\nHere ∗ denotes complex conjugation of all entries of the corresponding vector.

All these noise components are mutually uncorrelated.\nEstimating (29) and and combining (30)-(33), after calcu- lations, we obtain for given A k and β jkl :\nIt is proven in [4] that assuming the worst case Gaussian noise in the effective channel we obtain a capacity bound:\nThe expression (34) allows one to simulate SINRs in a fast way without generating M -dimensional vectors.\nTheorem 2 shows that reduction ρ f by the factor of 2 can be compensated by doubling M .
