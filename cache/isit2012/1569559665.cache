In this paper, we show that the upper triangular matrix R encountered during the sphere decoding of a linear dispersion STBC can be rank-deﬁcient even when the rate of the code is less than the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas. We then show that all known families of high rate (rate greater than 1) multigroup ML decodable codes have rank- deﬁcient R matrix, even when the rate is less than the number of transmit and receive antennas, and this rank-deﬁciency problem arises only when the number of receive antennas is strictly less than the number of transmit antennas. Unlike the codes with full-rank R matrix, the average sphere decoding complexity of the STBCs whose R matrix is rank-deﬁcient is polynomial in the constellation size, and hence is high. We derive the sphere decoding complexity of most of the known high rate multigroup ML decodable codes, and show that for each code, the complexity is a decreasing function of the number of receive antennas."},"body":{"text":"We consider Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) for an N transmit antenna, M receive antenna, quasi-static MIMO channel with Rayleigh ﬂat fading, Y = XH + W, where X is the T × N codeword matrix and W is the additive noise at the receiver. The entries of H and W are i.i.d. zero mean, complex Gaussian random variables. The channel H is assumed to be known at the receiver, but not at the transmitter. Let C = \t K i=1 x i A i [x 1 , . . . , x K ] T ∈ A be an STBC encoding K real information symbols x 1 , . . . , x K , where the T × N complex matrices A 1 , . . . , A K , which are called linear dis- persion or weight matrices, are linearly independent over the real ﬁeld R [1], [2], and the ﬁnite signal set A ⊂ R K . The rate of C is R = K 2T complex symbols per channel use (cspcu). The linear independence of the weight matrices implies that R ≤ N . The code C is said to be multigroup or g-group ML decodable if {x 1 , . . . , x K } can be partitioned into g subsets or groups , such that each group of symbols can be ML decoded independently of other symbol groups. Because such codes offer reduced complexity ML decoding, they have gathered much interest in the literature. Examples include [2]\u2013[5] and the references therein, and the more recent high rate (R > 1) codes in [6]\u2013[10].\nGenerally, the signal set A is chosen in such a way that the STBC C has full-diversity and large coding gain. In\nmost cases A is chosen to be a subset of ΘZ K , where Θ ∈ R K×K is a full-ranked matrix. For a complex ma- trix A, let vec(A) denote the complex vector obtained by stacking the columns of A one below the other and let vec(A) = [vec(A Re ) T vec(A Im ) T ] T . Now, the received ma- trix Y can be rewritten as y = vec(Y) = Gx + w, where x = [x 1 , . . . , x K ] T , w = vec(W) and the equivalent channel matrix\nConsider the vector of transformed information symbols s = Θ −1 x which takes values from A = Θ −1 A ⊂ Z K . The components of s take integer values and hence one can use a sphere decoder to decode s and then obtain the ML estimate of the information vector x. The ML decoder is given by ˆ s = arg min s∈A ||y − GΘs|| 2 F .\nFor a system where rank(G) = K, the sphere decoding complexity, averaged over noise and channel realizations, is independent of the constellation size , and is roughly polyno- mial in the dimension of the sphere decoding search [11], [12]. However, if rank(G) = K < K, the average sphere decoding complexity is no more independent of the constellation size. In this case, the conventional sphere decoder is modiﬁed as fol- lows [13]: the R matrix resulting from the QR-decomposition of GΘ will be of the form R = [R a R b ] ∈ R K ×K , where R a is a K × K upper triangular, full-rank matrix. There is a corresponding partition of s as [s T a s T b ] T . If q is the size of the regular PAM constellation used, then for each of the q K−K\nvalues of the vector s b , the conditionally optimal estimate of s a is found by ﬁrst removing the interference from s b , and then using a sphere decoder with the upper triangular matrix R a to obtain the estimate ˆs a (s b ). Then, from the resulting q K−K\ntuples (ˆs a (s b ), s b ), the optimal vector is chosen by the brute- force enumeration of their ML metrics ||Y − HX|| 2 F . Thus, for any STBC whose equivalent channel matrix G is such that rank(G) = K < K, the sphere decoding complexity is of the order of q K−K .\nIt is claimed in [1] without proof that R ≤ min{M, N } is a sufﬁcient condition for rank(G) = K. In Section II, we show that the claim made in [1] is true only for M ≥ N , and there exist codes with rank(G) < K when R ≤ min{M, N } and M < N . This observation is the gateway to the new results\nWe now introduce the notion of singularity of an STBC which is a direct indicator of its sphere decoding complexity (note that since H is a random matrix, rank(G) is a random variable as well).\nDeﬁnition 1: Let C be an STBC with rate R ≤ min{M, N }. We say that C is singular for M receive antennas if rank(G) < K with probability 1. Otherwise, C is said to be non-singular for M receive antennas.\nExample 1: In [6], a rate R = 17 8 code for N = 4 antennas with K = 17 real symbols was presented. Let the number of receive antennas be M = 3. Then, R < min{M, N } and the equivalent channel matrix G is of size 24 × 17. Now consider the following randomly generated channel matrix\nThe resulting G matrix has rank only 16 and the upper triangular matrix R of size 24 × 17 obtained from its QR- decomposition is of the form [R T 1 0 T ] T , where R 1 ∈ R 16×17 is shown in (1) at the top of the next page, and 0 is the 8 × 17 all zero matrix. The non-zero entries of R 1 are denoted by \u2018a\u2019. From (1), we see that the ﬁrst 16 columns of R are linearly independent and the last column lies in the span of the ﬁrst 16 columns. After removing the last 8 rows of R, which are all zeros, the sphere decoder uses the 16 × 17 real matrix R 1 to ﬁnd the ML estimate of the information vector. In this case, the complexity of sphere decoding this STBC for this particular channel realization H is of the order of q 17−16 = q. In Section III-A, by establishing that rank(G) = 16 with probability 1 when the randomness of H is taken into account, we show that this STBC is singular for M = 3.\nThe contributions and organization of this paper are as follows.\ntion for an STBC to be non-singular for M receive anten- nas (Theorem 1, Section II). Thus, even when M ≥ R, the matrix R need not be full-ranked. We also show that the case of singular STBCs arises only for asymmetric MIMO systems with M < N (Proposition 1, Section II).\n\u2022 We show that all known families of high rate (R > 1) multigroup ML decodable codes [6]\u2013[10] are non- singular for certain values of M (Section III, see Table I for a summary of results).\n\u2022 We derive the sphere decoding complexity of almost all known high-rate multigroup ML decodable codes and show that in each case the sphere decoding complexity is\na decreasing function of the number of receive antennas (Section III, see Table I).\nNotations: Throughout the paper, matrices (vectors) are denoted in bold, uppercase (lowercase) letters. For a complex matrix A, its transpose and conjugate-transpose are denoted by A T and A H , respectively. The n×n identity matrix is denoted by I n and 0 is the null matrix of appropriate dimension. Unless used as a subscript or to denote indices, i =\n−1. For square matrices A j , j = 1, . . . , d, diag(A 1 , . . . , A d ) denotes the square, block-diagonal matrix with A 1 , . . . , A d on the diagonal, in that order.\nThe proofs of all the propositions, theorems and other claims are omitted due to space considerations, but are avail- able in [14] along with several illustrative examples.\nWe now present a few fundamental results on the rank of the equivalent channel matrix. The following proposition says that the rank-deﬁciency problem arises only in asymmetric MIMO with M < N .\nProposition 1: If M ≥ N , every T × N STBC is non- singular for M receive antennas.\nLet A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A K denote the R-linear subspace of C T ×N spanned by the matrices A 1 , . . . , A K .\nProposition 2: Let B 1 , . . . , B K be T ×N complex matrices such that A 1 , . . . , A K = B 1 , . . . , B K and let H ∈ C N ×M be any matrix. Then the column spaces of the matrices\nG A (H) = [vec(A 1 H) vec(A 2 H) · · · vec(A K H)] and (2) G B (H) = [vec(B 1 H) vec(B 2 H) · · · vec(B K H)] \t (3)\nThe following result shows that if every weight matrix of a given STBC is multiplied on the left by a constant invertible matrix, then the rank of the equivalent channel matrix is unchanged.\nProposition 3: Let C ∈ C T ×T be any full-rank matrix, B i = CA i , i = 1, . . . , K, and H be any N × M complex matrix. Then we have rank(G A (H)) = rank(G B (H)), where G A (H) and G B (H) are as deﬁned in (2) and (3).\nIt is shown in [10] that for any N ≥ 1, there exists an explicitly constructable set of N 2 matrices belonging to C N ×N that are unitary, Hermitian and linearly independent over R. This set of matrices forms a basis for the space of N × N Hermitian matrices. Denote by C Herm N \t any STBC obtained by using these N 2 matrices as weight matrices. For positive integers n and m, deﬁne the function\nwhere (a) + = max{a, 0}. We now state the main result of this paper.\nTheorem 1: The equivalent channel matrix of the STBC C Herm N \t for M receive antennas has rank f (N, M ) with probability 1.\nIn Section III, we use the above theorem to arrive at the rank of the equivalent channel matrix of almost all known high-rate multigroup ML decodable codes.\nThe rate of C Herm N \t is N 2 , the number of symbols is K = N 2 , and the rank of the equivalent channel is less than K whenever M < N . Thus, this STBC is singular for all N 2 ≤ M < N .\nExample 2: Consider the STBC C Herm 3 \t used in an asym- metric MIMO system with M = 2 receive antennas. In this case, R = 3 2 < min{M, N } and the equivalent channel matrix G is of size 12 × 9. From Theorem 1, we know that the rank of G is equal to f (3, 2) = 8 with probability 1. Hence, this STBC is singular for 2 receive antennas. The 9 weight matrices of the STBC C Herm 3 \t are as follows\nThe structure of the 12 × 9 upper triangular matrix R obtained from the QR decomposition of G is\nThe sphere decoder uses the 8 × 9 matrix R obtained from R by deleting its last 4 rows which are all zero. Hence, for this particular channel realization H, the sphere decoding complexity is of the order of q 9−8 = q.\nSuppose the code obtained from an STBC C with a sig- nal set A is g-group ML decodable for some g > 1. The information symbols {x 1 , . . . , x K } can be partitioned into g vectors x I 1 , . . . , x I g of length λ 1 , . . . , λ g respectively such that each symbol vector can be ML decoded independently of other symbol vectors. There is a corresponding partition of the channel matrix into g submatrices G 1 , . . . , G g , such that\nIn [15] it is shown that for any k = k and any channel realization H, every column of G k is orthogonal to every column of G k . As a direct consequence of this, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 4: For any g-group ML decodable STBC and any channel realization H, rank(G) = g k=1 rank(G k ).\nIn this section, we show that all known families of high- rate (R > 1) multigroup ML decodable codes are singular for certain number of receive antennas. Table I summarizes the results of this section. The table lists the sphere decoding complexity and the minimum number of receive antennas for non-singularity of C Herm N , all the codes in [6], [8], [9], and the codes in [10] corresponding to even number of ML decoding groups.\nIn [6], a 2-group decodable STBC for 4 transmit antennas with R = 17 8 was constructed (see Example 1). For this code, with the notations as used in (4), g = 2, x I 1 = x 1 , λ 1 = 1, x I 2 = [x 2 , . . . , x 17 ] T , λ 2 = 16 and G = [G 1 G 2 ]. The weight matrix corresponding to x 1 is I 4 . Since any two weight matrices from different ML decoding groups must be Hurwitz- Radon orthogonal [3], [5], i.e., satisfy A H i A j + A H j A i = 0,\nall the matrices in the second group are skew-Hermitian, i.e., A H i = −A i , i = 2, · · · , 17. As a result, we can express these weight matrices as A i = iI 4 .A i , i = 2, · · · , 17, with A 1 , . . . , A 17 being Hermitian matrices. It is clear that for any channel realization H, G 1 = [vec(H)], which is non-zero with probability 1. Hence, rank(G 1 ) = 1 with probability 1. From Proposition 3 and Theorem 1, rank(G 2 ) = f (4, M ) with probability 1. So,\n1) For M = 3, rank(G 2 ) = 15. Since x I 1 and x I 2 can be decoded independently of each other, the sphere decoding complexity of the ﬁrst group is independent of q while that of the second group is O(q (16−15) ) = O(q). Consequently, the sphere decoding complexity of the code in [6] is O(q) for 3 receive antennas.\n2) For M ≥ 4, f (4, M ) = 16, hence the STBC in [6] is non-singular, and its sphere decoding complexity is independent of q.\nA family of 2-group ML decodable STBCs was constructed in [9] for N = 2 m , m > 1 antennas with rate R = N 4 + 1 N cspcu. This family includes the rate 5 4 code of [7] for N = 4 as a special case. The number of symbols in the STBC is K = N 2 2 + 2. In the rest of this subsection we show that\nR ≤ M < N 2 , where a is the smallest integer greater than or equal to a. Note that the sphere decoding complexity is a decreasing function of the number of receive antennas M .\nThe STBCs of [9] have a block diagonal structure. The weight matrices for N = 2 m antennas are of the form diag(V 1 , V 2 ), where V 1 , V 2 ∈ C n×n are unitary and n = N 2 . Denote the set of weight matrices belonging to the ﬁrst and the second ML decoding groups by G 1 and G 2 , respectively. For all the matrices in G 1 , V 1 is constant, denoted by F 1 , and\nfor all the matrices in G 2 , V 2 is constant, denoted by F 2 . Each group contains n 2 + 1 real symbols.\nWe will now derive the rank of the submatrix G 1 of G that corresponds to G 1 = {A 1 , . . . , A n 2 +1 }. Con- sider the set G 1 = {A i = CA i , i = 1, . . . , n 2 + 1}, where C = diag(I n , iF H 2 ). Since C is unitary, from Proposition 3, the rank of G 1 equals the rank of G 1 , the equivalent channel matrix corresponding to G 1 . Since the multiplication of all the weight matrices of an STBC by a unitary matrix does not affect its multigroup ML decodability, for every matrix B ∈ G 2 , CB is Hurwitz-Radon orthogonal to A j , j = 1, . . . , n 2 + 1, where A j and CB are block diagonal and are of the form\nfor some unitary matrices D j and V. This implies that every D j , j = 1, . . . , n 2 + 1 is Hurwitz-Radon orthogonal to iI n . Thus, {D j |j = 1, . . . , n 2 + 1} is a set of n × n unitary, Hermitian matrices.\n0 D n 2 +1 , \t (5) and from Proposition 3 has the same dimension as that of A 1 , . . . , A n 2 +1 over R, which is equal to n 2 + 1. The ﬁrst matrix in (5) is linearly independent of the remaining matrices and hence the dimension of the span of the re- maining matrices in (5) is n 2 . Without loss of generality, let us assume that D 1 , . . . , D n 2 are linearly independent, thus\nD 1 , . . . , D n 2 is the space of all n × n Hermitian matrices. Then, A 1 , . . . , A n 2 +1 equals the space spanned by\nLet the channel matrix be partitioned as H = [H T 1 H T 2 ] T , where H 1 , H 2 ∈ C n×M . From Proposition 2, the rank\nof G 1 is the dimension of the space spanned by matrices in (6) multiplied on the right by H, i.e.,\nD n 2 H 2 . With probability 1, H 1 is non-zero and hence the ﬁrst matrix is linearly independent of the remaining matrices. From Theorem 1 and Proposition 2, the dimension of the span of the remaining n 2 matrices is f (n, M ) = n 2 − ((n − M ) + ) 2 with probability 1. Thus rank(G 1 ) equals f (n, M ) + 1 with probability 1.\nSimilarly we can show that rank(G 2 ) = f (n, M ) + 1 with probability 1 as well. From Proposition 4, rank(G) = rank(G 1 ) + rank(G 2 ) \t which \t equals K = 2 N 2 4 − N 2 − M + 2 + 1 . Comparing this with\nK = 2 N 2 4 + 1 , we see that the STBCs in [9] are singular for all R ≤ M < N 2 .\nNow, the two groups of symbols can be ML decoded independently of each other, and the number of symbols in each group is K 2 , with rank(G 1 ) = rank(G 1 ) = K 2 . Thus, the sphere decoding complexity of the STBC is of the order of q K−K 2 = q ( N 2 −M ) +\nIn [8], 2-group ML decodable codes for all N ≥ 1 and all even T ≥ 2N were constructed with rate R = N − N 2 −1 T . The number of symbols per group is K 2 = T N − N 2 + 1. The codes of this family are singular for all R ≤ M < N receive antennas, and their sphere decoding complexity is O q (N −M ) + ·(T −N −M ) . From Proposition 1, it is clear that these codes are non-singular if and only if M ≥ N .\nExample 3: Consider the STBC from [8] for N = 4 and T = 2N = 8. The rate of this code is R = 17 8 and the number of symbols per decoding group is K 2 = 17. From the above discussion it is clear that this STBC is singular for M = 3. The rank of the equivalent channel matrix of each ML decoding group equals 16 with probability 1 and hence the sphere decoding complexity is O(q).\nIt is interesting to compare this code with the code from [6] which was discussed in Section III-A and Example 1, when the number of receive antennas is M = 3. Both codes have the same parameters N , R, and both have a sphere decoding complexity that is linear in the constellation size q. However, the code discussed in Section III-A is fast-group-decodable and 5 levels can be removed from the sphere decoding search tree of its second decoding group [6]. Hence, this code uses a 10-dimensional sphere decoder to decode the second group of 16 symbols. On the other hand, the code from [8] uses a 16 dimensional search tree for decoding each ML decoding group. Thus, the overall sphere decoding complexity of the code from [6] is less than that of [8].\nIn [10], delay optimal g-group ML decodable codes were constructed for all g > 1, N = ng2 g−1 2 , n ≥ 1, with rate R = N g2 g−1 + g 2 −g 2N . The sphere decoding complexity of the\nand the codes are non-singular only for M ≥ N g2 g−2 . Also in [10], non-delay optimal codes with T = gN , N = n2 g−1 2 , n ≥ 1, and rate R = N 2 g−1 + g−1 2N were constructed. The sphere decoding complexity of these codes for even values of g is of\nIn this paper we have shown that even when the rate R ≤ min{M, N }, the R matrix arising during the sphere decoding of an STBC can be rank deﬁcient, and that this rank- deﬁciency arises only in the case of asymmetric MIMO with M < N . Since the sphere decoding complexity decreases with increase in rank(R), for systems with M < N , the weight matrices must be constructed intelligently, so that the resulting code has an R matrix with a large rank."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"B.
