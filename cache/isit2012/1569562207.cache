More speciﬁcally, the focus is on the additive exponential noise (AEN) channel, for which the (binary) expansion of the (exponential) noise random variable is considered. It is shown that each of the random variables in the expansion corresponds to independent Bernoulli random variables. Thus, each of the expansion levels (of the underlying channel) corresponds to a binary symmetric channel (BSC), and the coding problem is reduced to coding over these parallel channels while satisfying the channel input constraint. This optimization formulation is stated as the achievable rate result, for which a speciﬁc choice of input distribution is shown to achieve a rate which is arbitrarily close to the channel capacity in the high SNR regime.

We apply this coding over expansions method to additive exponential noise (AEN) channels, where the signal and noise terms constructing the channel output are represented with their corresponding binary digits. Focusing on the additive exponential noise component, we show that the binary expansion of the noise consists of independent Bernoulli distributed random variables at each level. (The mean of each random variable is a function of its level number in the expansion and the mean of the underlying exponential noise.) This way, thanks to the expan- sion technique, we show that continuous alphabet channels can be considered as a set of parallel binary symmetric channels (BSCs).\nInstead of coding for every level in the expansion, we con- sider signaling over a ﬁnite number of levels, and we resolve the problem arising from carryovers either by considering them as noise, or by decoding them the least signiﬁcant bit onwards to the most signiﬁcant bit. For each case, we state the corresponding achievable rate as an optimization problem, where the rate is maximized over the choices of the Bernoulli distributions for the signal transmission over each level with the constraint that that the combined random variables satisfy\nthe channel input constraint. Then, utilizing an approximately optimal input distribution, we show that one can celebrate the achievability of an ǫ-gap to capacity result in the high SNR regime. This method together with capacity-achieving low- complexity codes (such as polar coding) allows one to achieve the capacity of the AEN in the high SNR regime.\nThe additive exponential noise (AEN) channel is of par- ticular interest as it models worst-case noise given a mean and a non-negativity constraint on noise [1]. In addition, the AEN model naturally arises in non-coherent communication settings, and in optical communication scenarios. (We refer to [1] and [2] for an extensive discussion on the AEN channel.) Verd´u derived the optimal input distribution and the capacity of the AEN channel in [1]. Martinez, on the other hand, proposed the pulse energy modulation scheme, which can be seen as a generalization of amplitude modulation for the Gaussian channels. In this scheme, the constellation symbols are chosen as c(i − 1) l , for i = 1, · · · , 2 M with a constant c, and it is shown that the information rates obtained from this constellation can achieve an energy (SNR) loss of 0.76 dB (with the best choice of l = 1 2 (1 +\nthe capacity in the high SNR regime. Another constellation technique for this coded modulation approach is recently considered in [3], where log constellations are designed such that the real line is divided into ( 2M − 1) equally probable intervals. M of the centroids of these intervals are chosen as constellation points, and, by a numerical computation of the mutual information, it is shown that these constellations can achieve within a 0.12 dB SNR gap in the high SNR regime. Our approach, which achieves arbitrarily close to the capacity of the channel, outperforms these previously proposed modulation techniques.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the AEN channel model. In Section III, we present the key result which shows that independent Bernoulli distributed random variables occur in the binary expansion of an exponential random variable. Armed with this result, Section IV develops the expansion coding technique, where we state the main results of the paper. Numerical results are provided in Section IV-C, and the paper is concluded with a discussion section (Section V).\nWe consider the additive exponential noise (AEN) channel given by\nwhere Z i \u2019s denote additive noise terms and are independently and identically distributed according to an exponential density with mean E Z ; i.e., omitting the index i, the noise has the following density:\nThe transmitter conveys one of the messages, m, which is uniformly distributed in M, i.e., the random message M ∈ M {1, · · · , 2 nR }; and it does so by mapping the message to the channel input using the encoding function f (·) : M → X n , where X n 1 (m) = f (m), under the constraint that X = ℜ and\nThe decoder uses the decoding function g(·) to map its channel observations to an estimate of the message. Specif- ically, g(·) : Y n → M, where the estimate is denoted by\nThe rate R is said to be achievable, if the average probability of error deﬁned by\ncan be made small for large n. The capacity of AEN is denoted by C, which is the maximum achievable rate R.\nwhere SNR = E X E Z , and the capacity achieving input distribu- tion is given by\n(6) where δ(x) = 1 if x = 0, and 0 otherwise. Note that this is the p ∗ (x) = arg max\nI(X; Y ), where p(y|x) is given by the AEN channel (1).\nSurprisingly, while the capacity achieving input distribution for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is Gaussian, here the optimal input distribution is not exponen- tially distributed. However, we observe that in the high SNR regime, the optimal distribution gets closer to an exponential distribution with mean E X + E Z .\nWe show the following lemma, which allows us to have in- dependent Bernoulli random variables in the binary expansion of an exponential random variable.\nLemma 1: Let B l \u2019s be independent Bernoulli random vari- ables with parameters given by p l , i.e., Pr {B l = 1} = p l and Pr {B l = 0} = 1 − p l , and consider the random variable deﬁned by\nimplies that the random variable B is exponentially distributed with mean λ − 1 , i.e., the density of B is given by\nProof: The proof follows by extending the one given in [4], which considers the expansion of a truncated exponential random variable. (The proof is omitted here due to space constraints and is given in [5].)\nOur proposed coding scheme, referred to as expansion coding, consists of constructing binary expansion of the chan- nel and coding for the resulting (dependent) parallel binary symmetric channels (BSCs). More speciﬁcally, for some non- negative L 1 and L 2 , binary expansion refers to a modulation scheme over the binary expansion of the channel for levels ranging from −L 1 to L 2 , i.e.,\nWhen we take the limit L 1 , L 2 → ∞, the channel given by (10) corresponds to the one given by (1).\nWe propose coding over the expansion levels of this chan- nel. More speciﬁcally, the least signiﬁcant bit channel is given by\nA capacity achieving BSC code is utilized over this channel with input probability distribution given by p −L 1 . (For ex- ample, the polar coding method [6], allows one to construct capacity achieving codes for the l = −L 1 level channel.) Instead of directly using the capacity achieving code design, we use the combination of the capacity achieving code and the method of Gallager [7] to achieve a rate corresponding to the one obtained by the mutual information I(X l ; Y l ) evaluated with an input distribution given by a Bernoulli distribution\nwith parameter p l . (The desired distributions will be made clear in the following part.)\nNoting that the sum is a modulo- 2 sum in the above channel, there will be carryovers from this sum to the next level, l = −L 1 + 1. Denoting the carryover seen at level l as C i,l , the remaining channels can be represented with with the following\nwhere the effective noise, ˜ Z i,l , is a Bernoulli random variable obtained by the convolution of the noise and the carryover ˜ q l Pr { ˜ Z i,l = 1} = q l ⊗ c l q l (1 − c l ) + c l (1 − q l ) with q l Pr {Z i,l = 1} and c l Pr {C i,l = 1}. Here, the carry over probability is given by\nDue to Lemma 1, the noise seen at each level will be described by independent Bernoulli random variables, and therefore, our coding scheme will be over the parallel channels given by (13) for l = −L 1 , · · · , L 2 , where the noise for each level is distributed as Pr { ˜ Z i,l = 1} = ˜q l = q l ⊗ (p l− 1 ˜ q l− 1 ), and ˜ q −L 1 − 1 0, p −L 1 − 1 = 0.\nUsing a capacity achieving code for BSCs, combined with the Gallager\u2019s method, expansion coding readily achieves the following result.\nTheorem 2: Expansion coding, when implemented with ca- pacity achieving codes for the resulting BSCs, achieves the rate given by\nfor any L 1 , L 2 > 0, where ˜ q l = q l ⊗ (p l− 1 ˜ q l− 1 ) for l > −L 1 and ˜ q −L 1 = q −L 1 . To satisfy the energy constraint, p l ∈ [0, 0.5] is chosen such that\nThe optimization problem stated in the result above is highly non-trivial. However, utilizing the optimal input distribution given in (6), one can adopt the following approximate dis- tributions in Theorem 2. At a high SNR, we observe that the optimal input distribution can be approximated by an exponential distribution. Then, one can simply choose p l from the binary expansion of the exponential distribution with mean E X + E Z . To satisfy the power constraint, we use coding only\nof the time, and for the rest we set the channel input to 0. (As a second approach, in the numerical results, we compare this choice with that of choosing p l from the binary expansion of the exponential distribution with mean E X .) The next method gives a better rate result with a minimal increase in complexity.\nIn the scheme above, let us consider decoding starting from the level l = −L 1 . The receiver will obtain the correct X i,−L 1 for i = 1, · · · , n. As the receiver has the knowledge of Y i,−L 1 for i = 1, · · · , n, it will also have the knowledge of the correct noise sequence N i,−L 1 for i = 1, · · · , n. With this knowledge, the receiver can directly obtain C i,−L 1 +1 for i = 1, · · · , n, which is the carryover from level l = −L 1 to level l = −L 1 + 1. Using this carryover sequence in decoding at level l = −L 1 + 1, the receiver can get rid of carryover noise. Thus, the effective channel that the receiver will see can be represented by\nfor l = −L 1 , · · · , L 2 . We remark that with this decoding strategy the effective channels will no longer be a set of independent parallel channels, as decoding in one level affects the channels at higher levels. However, if the utilized coding method is strong enough (e.g., if the error probability decays to 0 exponentially with n), then this carryover decoding error can be made insigniﬁcant by increasing n for a given number of levels (here, L 1 + L 2 + 1). We state the rate resulting from this approach in the following.\nTheorem 3: Expansion coding, by decoding the carryovers, achieves the rate given by\nCompared to the previous case, the optimization problem is simpler here as the rate expression is simply the sum of the rates obtained from a set of parallel channels.\nWe now show that the proposed scheme achieves the capac- ity of AEN channel in the high SNR regime for a sufﬁciently high number of levels. Towards this end, we provide a bound for the capacity gap, ∆C C − ˆ C, where\nis the achievable rate given in Theorem 3 with L 1 = L, L 2 = L + γ, and γ = log(1 + SNR), when the approximate input distribution discussed above (i.e., exponential with mean E X + E Z ) is used. First, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of entropy at each level. (Without loss of generality, we assume E Z = 1 in the following analysis.)\nLemma 4: Entropy of the Bernoulli random variable at level l, H(q l ), is bounded by\nH(q l ) < c 1 · 2 −l \t for l ≥ 0, \t (21) H(q l ) > 1 − c 2 · 2 l for l ≤ 0, \t (22)\nFig. 1: Signal and noise probabilities, and rate per level. p l , q l , p l ⊗ q l and rate at each level are shown, where γ = 15. The coding scheme with L = 5 covers the signiﬁcant portion of the rate obtained by using all of the parallel channels. As shown in the text, p l is a shifted version of q l .\nwhere c 1 and c 2 are both constants taking the values c 1 = 3 log e and c 2 = log e.\n> log(1 + 1) − log e · 2 l = 1 − log e · 2 l .\nOn the other hand, when l ≥ 0, by using the facts that log(1+ x) < log e · x for any 0 < x < 1, and e x > 1 + x + x 2 /2 for any x > 0, we have\n< 2 −l 2 log e + 2 −l log e = 2 −l 3 log e.\nThis lemma shows us that the tails bounds are exponential. Although better bounds may exist, the exponential bound is sufﬁcient for further analysis. Based on the Lemma above, we obtain the following.\nTheorem 5: For any ǫ > 0, there exists an ǫ-dependent (positive) constant c = log γ (1+8 log e) ǫ \t , such that if γ ≥ 2c and L ≥ c, then the capacity gap is bounded by ∆C ≤ ǫ. (The total number of levels is given by 2L + γ + 1, where γ = log(1 + SNR).)\nwhere the last inequality is due to the fact that H(p l ⊗ q l ) ≥ H(p l ). Observing that\n(2) −c < l < c: [H(p l ) − H(q l )] + [H(p l +γ ) − H(q l +γ )] = H(p l ) − H(q l +γ ) > 1 − c 2 · 2 l−γ − c 1 · 2 − (l+γ) , and\n(3) −L ≤ l ≤ −c and γ+c ≤ l ≤ γ+L: H(p l )−H(q l ) > 0. Combining these pieces together, and lower bounding the\nsummation over indices l ∈ [−L : L + γ] by considering the summation over l ∈ [−c + 1 : γ + c − 1], we obtain\nwhere the last inequality uses the assumption that γ ≥ 2c. Thus, we obtain a bound for the capacity gap\n≤ γ − (1 − 2 −γ )γ(1 − 2 −c 8 log e) < γ2 −γ + γ2 −c 8 log e ≤ γ2 −c (1 + 8 log e)\nFig. 2: Numerical results. R 1 : The rate obtained by consid- ering carry over as noise. R 2 : The rate obtained by decoding carry overs at each level. C 1 : Choosing p l from the binary ex- pansion of the exponential distribution with mean E X +E Z . To satisfy the power constraint, only a fraction of the channel uses (i.e., E X /(E X + E Z ) of the time) is utilized. C 2 : Choosing p l from the binary expansion of the exponential distribution with mean E X . Solid and dotted curves correspond to coding over 41 and 21 number of levels, respectively.\nwhere we used γ ≥ 2c and choose c = log γ (1+8 log e) ǫ \t . Fig. 1 helps explicate the key steps of the proof.\nWe calculate the rates obtained from the two schemes above ( R 1 in Theorem 2 and R 2 in Theorem 3) with two different input probability distribution choices (denoted by C 1 and C 2 ):\n\u2022 C 1 : Choosing p l from the binary expansion of the expo- nential distribution with mean E X + E Z . To satisfy the power constraint, we use coding only for the fraction of the channel uses (i.e., E X /(E X + E Z ) of the time).\n\u2022 C 2 : Choosing p l from the binary expansion of the expo- nential distribution with mean E X .\nThe ﬁrst choice closely resembles the optimal distribution given in (6). However, as the unused channels vanish in the high SNR regime, we expect that both choices result in the same rate as SNR gets large. Numerical results are given in Fig. 2. It is evident from the ﬁgure (and from the analysis given in Theorem 5) that the proposed technique, when implemented with sufﬁciently large number of levels, outperforms the SNR gaps previously reported in [2] and [3].\n\u2022 Expansion coding allows the construction of good chan- nel codes for discrete-time continuous channels using good discrete memoryless channel codes. For instance, one can utilize binary expansion together with polar codes. The underlying code is q-ary polar code, as we\nneed to implement Gallager\u2019s method in constructing the input distribution p(x) = Ber(p l ) for coding over level l. (See, e.g., [6], [8] for details.) In addition, expansion modulation can be implemented over a q-ary expansion of the channel, and any good code for the resulting modulo q-sum channel can be used.\n\u2022 Avestimehr et al. [9] have introduced the deterministic approximation approach for point-to-point and multi-user channels. The basic idea is to construct an approximate channel for which the transmitted signals are assumed to be noiseless above the noise level. Using this high SNR approximation, one only needs to deal with the interfer- ence seen at a particular receiver (in a networked model). Expansion coding scheme can be seen as a generalization of these deterministic approaches. Here, the (effective) noise in the channel is carefully calculated and the system takes advantage of coding over the noisy levels at any SNR. This generalized channel approximation approach can be useful in reducing the large gaps reported in the previous works.\n\u2022 Although our discussion is limited to the AEN channel, where the proposed scheme outperforms the previously proposed modulation schemes and performs arbitrarily close to the capacity of the AEN channel, the expansion coding refers to a more general framework and is not limited to such channels. Towards this end, our ongoing efforts are focused on utilizing the proposed scheme for AEN multiple-user channels, and for their AWGN counterparts.\nWe thank G. D.
