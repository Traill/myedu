Such small cell networks are attractive to wireless operator since femtocells are deployed at the user premises and they leverage on the user\u2019s existing broadband internet connection as backhaul. In this way, there is no additional deployment cost, energy supply cost or site rental incurred on the operator.\nRecently, the concept of interference alignment (IA) was introduced as a linear beamforming technique to align beam- forming matrices at the transmitters such that the interference at each receiver is aligned in an interference subspace, leaving the desired signal to transmit in an interference-free subspace [5]. At the receivers, we can apply a simple zero-forcing receiving vector to project the desired signal onto the inter- ference free subspace which is sufﬁcient for signal detection. There is great interest in employing this concept of IA in different type of interference networks [6]\u2013[9].\nIn this paper, we consider a two-tier MIMO network in the downlink, consisting of a single macrocell base station (MBS) with multiple transmit antennas coexisting with several closed-access MIMO FAPs. With multiple receive antennas at both the macrocell and femtocell users, we propose an opportunistic IA scheme to design the transmit and receive beamformers in order to mitigate intra and inter-tier inter- ference. Moreover, to reduce the number of macrocell and femtocell users coexisting in the same spectrum, we apply a random spectrum allocation on top of the opportunistic IA scheme. Closely related to our work is [9], where IA\nwas combined with interference cancellation to mitigate the cross-tier interference in heterogeneous networks. In contrast, our proposed scheme takes into account the random spatial model of FAPs as well as the dense deployment of femtocell networks. By applying stochastic geometry, we evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme in terms of distribution of received signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present our system model. In Section III, we describe our proposed interference alignment scheme. In Section IV, the performance analysis of our proposed interference coordination scheme is provided. Some numerical results are provided in Section VI. Finally, conclusion is given in Section VII. Throughout the paper, we shall use the following notation. Boldface upper- case letters denote matrices, boldface lower-case letters denote column vectors, and plain lower-case letters denote scalars. The superscripts (·) T , (·) ∗ , and (·) \u2020 denote the transpose, complex conjugate, and transpose conjugate, respectively. We denote | · | as the absolute value, and · as the standard Euclidean norm.\nConsider a two-tier network with a central MBS of M t c antennas serving a circular region C of radius R c . The macro- cell is underlaid with a random number of FAPs equipped with M t f antennas. The FAPs are spatially distributed according to a homogeneous poisson point process (PPP) ¨ f with intensity λ f . Therefore, the average number of FAPs within the cellular coverage is given by N f = λ f |C|. For each FAP, we consider a circular cell coverage of radius R f , where U f femtocell users (FUEs) are uniformly distributed on the circumference of each cell, such that R f R c .\nAssume that the available spectrum is split into B sub- channels, each with bandwidth W Hz and the MBS uses all these subchannels to serve N c MUEs in the macrocell tier. Furthermore, we divide the N c MUEs into macrocell user groups, such that each user group consists of n c MUEs sharing b subchannels. We denote M as a group of MUEs that contains n c MUEs. To avoid interference among each macrocell user group, we assume that the b subchannels allocated to each group are mutually orthogonal. Therefore, by employing multiuser MIMO, the MBS can serve all the n c MUEs simultaneously within each macrocell user group for a given set of b subchannels. At the femtocell tier, we consider that the FAPs apply F-ALOHA spectrum access strategy,\nwhere each FAP exactly access one group of b subchannels among B with independently and equal probability. Therefore, the F-ALOHA thins the mean number of FAPs in each subchannels by the spectrum access probability p = b B . Within each FAP, we employ TDMA as the multiple access scheme to serve one FUE at each time slot for a chosen set of b subchannels, and the average number of active users within the cellular coverage becomes N = N c + pN f . In other words, for a given time slot and a given group of b subchannels, there will be n c MUEs coexisting with a random number of FUEs, which are spatially distributed according to a PPP ψ f with intensity λ f = pλ f . When p = 1, the MBS will use the whole spectrum to serve all the N c MUEs simultaneously and all the FAPs can also access the entire spectrum. On the other hand, when p = 1/N c , the MBS only serves one MUE and this MUE is only interfered by the cross-tier interference from femtocells.\nFor both tiers, the downlink channel is characterized by a combination of path loss and Rayleigh fading. The path loss function at a ﬁxed distance R is g(x) = R −α , where α is the path loss exponent. In the following, we denote α o , α i , and α io as the path loss exponent of the outdoor link, the indoor link, and the cross link between indoor and outdoor, respectively. For macrocell tier, we denote q q q fi ∈ C M r f ×M t c and q q q fi ∈ C M r c ×M t c as the random channel matrices from the MBS to the FUE of the ith FAP and to the ith MUE, respectively, where each entry of the above matrices is distributed as CN (0, 1) 1 . For the femtocell tier, we denote r r r ij ∈ C M r f ×M t f\nand u u u ij ∈ C M r c ×M t f as the random channel matrices from the jth FAP to the FUE in the ith FAP and the ith MUE, respectively, where each entry of the above matrices is also distributed as CN (0, 1).\nEach FAP (or MBS) transmits signal to its users by applying a transmit beamforming vector. By denoting the transmit beamforming vector from the ith FAP to its own FUE as v i ∈ C M t f ×1 and the transmit beamforming vector from the MBS to the jth MUE as f j ∈ C M t c ×1 , the received signals at the 0th FUE and the 0th MUE within group M can be, respectively, expressed as\nwhere R i is the distance from jth FAP to the 0th FUE or the 0th MUE, D is the distance from the MBS to the 0th FUE and D 0 is the distance from the MBS to the 0th MUE. Moreover, s i and x j are the desired signal for FUE\nin femtocell ith and MUE jth within group M, respectively, such that E {s i s ∗ i } = P f and E x j x ∗ j = P c . In addition, n f and n c are the M r f × 1 and M r c × 1 AWGN noise vectors with zero mean and variance N 0 , respectively. Let the received beamforming vectors of the ith FUE and the ith MUE be w i ∈ C 1×M r f and u i ∈ C 1×M r c , the received signals after applying the above receive beamforming vectors in (1) and (2) become\nNote that according to Slivnyak\u2019s Theorem, the statistics of interference observed by any node in the network is the same if the nodes form a homogeneous PPP [10]. Therefore, it allows us to consider a typical receiver for each tier in the following, which is represented as the 0th FUE and 0th MUE, respectively.\nDue to the large number of FAPs and their random deploy- ment, it is challenging to suppress all the interference from the FAPs. Instead, our opportunistic IA scheme only cancels the nearest interferer. Speciﬁcally, the description of our proposed scheme is given as follows:\nStep 1: For a given set of subchannels, each MUE from the set of n c MUEs ﬁrst identiﬁes N c i nearest interfering FAPs in order to design its zero-forcing receive vec- tor u i such that it is orthogonal to all these interfering links. This is possible only if |N c i | ≤ M r − 1, where |N c i | is the number of identiﬁed nearest interfering FAPs. When this condition is satisﬁed, the receive beamforming vector at MUE i is given by\nStep 2: Next, we design the transmit beamforming vectors at the MBS such that the n c MUEs are mutually orthogonal to each other. Since the receive beam- forming vectors of the n c MUEs have already been determined in Step 1, we should take this into account in the design of our transmit beamforming vectors in this step as follows:\nStep 3: Now, we proceed to the design of the transmit beamforming vector at each FAP by applying the\nconcept of IA. Speciﬁcally, we ensure that the trans- mit beamforming vector is chosen such that the intra-tier interference from each FAP to its nearest victim FUE is aligned with the cross-tier interference from the MBS to this victim FUE. Mathematically, the transmit beamforming vector at FAP j needs to satisfy the following condition:\nsuch that M r f ≤ M t f and i is the user index of the nearest victim FUE.\nStep 4: Lastly, we simply need to design the receive beam- forming vector at each FAP. Since the intra-tier and cross-tier interference has been aligned in Step 3, we can simply design the receive beamforming vector at each FUE to be orthogonal to the aligned interference subspace as follows:\nDepending on the antenna conﬁgurations, our proposed scheme may not be feasible. Beside the conditions |N c i | ≤ M r −1 and M r f ≤ M t f in Steps 1 and 3, we need an additional condition to design feasible transmit and receive beamforming vectors of our proposed scheme as given by\nConsider a typical FUE, denoted as FUE 0, placed at the origin of the network, receiving its signal from FAP 0. After applying our opportunistic IA scheme, the received signal at FUE 0 is given by\nwhere the interference terms from the removal area  have been completely eliminated, leaving interference residual terms in ¯ , such that ψ f =  + ¯ . Since w i = 1 and\nv i = 1, h 0i and n f have the same distribution as each element of matrix r r r 0i and vector nnn f , respectively. We can write the received SINR of FUE 0 as follows:\nwhere E |n f | 2 = N 0 and I ¯  is the interference term contained in ¯ . For simplicity, we assume that each FAP has a different nearest victim FUE. Deﬁne \u0082 1 as the distance between the nearest interfering FAP and the victim FUE 0.\nHence, given the nearest distance \u0082 1 , the cumulative distribu- tion function (CDF) of (11) can be written as (17),\nF sinr f | R 1 ( |r) = 1 − P [sinr f ≥ |A, \u0082 1 ] P [A|\u0082 1 ] \t (12) − P sinr f ≥ | ¯ A, \u0082 1 P ¯ A| \u0082 1\nwhere is the predeﬁned QoS threshold and A is the event that the victim FUE is capable of canceling its nearest interfering FAP and ¯ A is the complement event of A. Conditioned on A and \u0082 1 , the success probability of transmission of FUE 0 is given by\nwhere µ = E |h 0i | 2 and L X (x) is the Laplace transform of the PDF of the RV \u0088. Similarly, given ¯ A and \u0082 1 , P sinr f ≥ ε| ¯ A, \u0082 1 has a similar form as (14), except that the RV I ¯  is replaced with I ψ f .\nThe interfering FAP that spans the same subspace with the interfering stream from the MBS to FUE 0 is not always the nearest neighbor to FUE 0. The event A is deﬁned when this FAP is the nearest neighbor that causes interference to FUE 0. When this happens, the FUE 0 can at the same time cancel both interference from MBS and nearest FAP 1. From Fig. 1, P [A|\u0082 1 ] can be interpreted as the probability that there is only one node that lies in the region ¯ Ξ, which can be written as\n¯ Ξ 2\n¯ Ξ 2\nwhere ¯ Ξ is the surface of the intersection of two circles whose distance of two centers are equal to their radius. Using (12) to (15), we provide the following theorem that characterizes the performance of FUE in terms of CDF of received SINR of FUE.\nTheorem 1: The CDF of the received SINR at FUE 0 is given by\nProof: Proof is omitted due to space constraint. Remark 1:\na) Using (17), we derive the lower bound on the success probability of transmission of FUE as follows:\nwhere (18) is the case of OIA scheme without Step 3. When α io = 4, we obtain a closed-form expression for P f,lo ( ) as follows:\nwhere (20) is the case when FUE can always success- fully cancel cross-tier and nearest intra-tier interference according to the OIA scheme. When α io = 4, we obtain a closed-form expression for P f,up (ε) as follows:\nThe received signal at MUE 0 placed at the origin away from the MBS with distance D 0 is given by\nwhere we have used the fact that after applying OIA, MUE 0 is free from the intra-tier interference from the MBS and nearest cross-tier interference from the FAPs. The received SINR at MUE 0 can be written as\nand we provide the following theorem to characterize the CDF of (23).\nTheorem 2: The CDF of received SINR at the MUE 0 is given by\nRemark 2: Using (24), we derive the lower bound on the success probability of transmission of MUE 0 as\nwhere (26) is the case of OIA scheme without step 1. When α io = 4, we obtain a closed-form expression for P c,lo (ε) as follows:\nIn this section, we show the numerical results based on our analysis and our proposed OIA scheme in terms of different performance metrics, namely: success probability, spatial average capacity, total network throughput, and energy efﬁciency. In the following, at the transmitting side, we assume 4 antennas for the MBS and 2 antennas for FAP; while, at the receiving side, we assume 2 antennas for FUE and MUE. We consider that MBS is placed at the center of C, where we ﬁxed the area |C| = πR 2 c . In addition, the MUEs are uniformly placed on the edge of a smaller circle centered around MBS with radius d.\nIn Fig. 2, we compare the SINR distribution of the FUE be- fore and after applying the OIA scheme for λ f = 1.59 × 10 −5 . From Fig. 2 we can see the effectiveness of the proposed OIA scheme and our analytical results match very well with the simulation results. By removing cross-tier interference and one nearest neighboring intra-tier interference, the SINR curve is shifted to the right, showing that a higher SINR can be\nachieved by employing OIA scheme. However, with only OIA scheme alone, the network performance cannot be improved signiﬁcantly (p = 1). The combination of random spectrum allocation (p = 0.2) together with OIA scheme increase the received SINR signiﬁcantly, as seen by the shifting of the curves to the right when both OIA scheme and spectrum allocation are applied.\nIn Fig. 3, the distributions of SINR for FUE after applying the OIA scheme are plotted for both sparse and dense de- ployment of FAPs. The results are shown for the cases with p = 1 and p = 0.2, which captures the effect of random allocation. From the ﬁgure, we see that our analysis match the simulation results very well for both FUE and MUE, regardless of the density of FAP. The performance gap between random and no random spectrum allocation becomes larger when the intensity of FAP increases. Thus, this further shows the importance of spectrum allocation in reducing intra- and inter-tier interference on top of the OIA scheme.\nIn this paper, we considered a two-tier MIMO network in the downlink, consisting of a single macrocell base station with multiple transmit antennas coexisting with several closed- access MIMO femtocells. With multiple receive antennas at both the macrocell and femtocell users, we proposed an OIA scheme to design the transmit and receive beamformers in order to mitigate intra and inter-tier interference. Moreover, to reduce the number of macrocell and femtocell users coexisting in the same spectrum, we apply a random spectrum allocation on top of the OIA scheme. By applying stochastic geometry, we evaluated the performance of our proposed scheme in terms of CDF of SINR and network throughput.\nThis work was supported by the National Research Foun- dation of Korea (KRF) grant funded by the Korea govern- ment(MEST) (No. 2011-0018071 and No. 2011-0001274) ."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"D.
