In this paper we consider a channel matrix H which is a sub-matrix of a Haar-distributed unitary matrix, i.e., drawn uniformly from the ensemble of all m × m unitary matrices, m ≥ m t , m r .\nThe three well-studied, classical random matrix ensem- bles are the Gaussian, Wishart and Jacobi (also known as MANOVA) ensembles [1], [2]. In fading wireless communi- cation, the commonly used Rayleigh model assumes that the channel matrix H comes from the Gaussian ensemble [3]\u2013 [5]. In that case, H \u2020 H comes from the Wishart ensemble. For the model assumed in this paper, H \u2020 H follows the Jacobi ensemble . It turns out that this model is both practically useful and it is qualitatively different than the Rayleigh model, leading to interesting theoretical results.\nAn important motivation to introduce such channels comes from recent developments in optical ﬁber communication. The expected capacity crunch in long haul optical ﬁbers [6] led to proposals for \u201cspace-division multiplexing\u201d (SDM) [7], that is to have several links at the same ﬁber, by either multi- ple single-mode ﬁber strands within a ﬁber cable, multiple cores within a multi-core ﬁber, or multiple modes within a multi-mode waveguide. An SDM system with m parallel transmission paths per wavelength can potentially multiply the throughput of a certain link by a factor of m. Since m can potentially be chosen very large, SDM technology\nis highly scalable. Now, a signiﬁcant crosstalk between the optical paths raises the need for MIMO signal processing techniques. Unfortunately, for large size MIMO (large m) this is currently unfeasible in the optical rates. Assuming that faster computation will be available in the future and having in mind that replacing optical ﬁbers to support SDM is a long and expensive procedure, a long term design is sought after. To that end and more, it was proposed to design an optical system that can support relatively large number of paths for future use, but at start to address only some of the paths. In this scenario the channel can be modeled as a sub-matrix of a larger unitary matrix, i.e., the Jacobi MIMO model is applicable.\nThis under-addressed channel is discussed in [7] where simulations of the capacities and outage probabilities were presented. In this paper we further analyze the channel in the ergodic and non-ergodic setting, where we provide an- alytical expression for the capacity, outage probability and the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. It should be noted that in optical systems the outage probability is an important measure, required to be very low. Evidently, since the entire channel matrix is unitary, when all paths are addressed a zero outage probability can be attained for any transmission rate. An interesting result that comes out of this work is that there are situations where a partial number of pathes are addressed, yet a number of streams are guaranteed to experience zero outage. Thus, choosing the number of addressed paths and the corresponding rate is a very critical design element that highly reﬂects on the system outage and performance.\nWhile the motivation for this work comes from optical ﬁber communication, it should be noted that in other cases, such as in-line communication and even wireless communication, this model and the insights that follow from it can be relevant as well. For example, in wireless communication, it is plausible to imagine that if there were enough receive antennas capturing most, if not all, transmitted energy, the unitary assumption can be justiﬁed, and so with the smaller number of antennas the channel can be modeled as a sub-matrix of a large unitary matrix. Indeed, as will be shown, when m is large in comparison to m t , m r , the Jacobi model (up to a normalizing constant) approaches the Rayleigh model.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We start by deﬁning the system model and presenting the channel statistics in Section II. An interesting transition threshold is revealed: when the number of addressed paths is large enough, so that k = m t + m r − m > 0, the statistics of the problem\nchanges. Using this observation we give analytic expressions for the ergodic capacity in Section III. In Section IV we analyze the outage probabilities in the non-ergodic channel and show that for k > 0 a strictly zero outage probability is obtainable for k degrees of freedom. Section V discusses the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the channel where we show an absorbing difference in the maximum diversity gain between the Rayleigh fading and Jacobi channels. Section VI summarizes and discusses the results.\nDue to space limitation, all proofs are omitted. We refer the reader to [8] for further detail.\nWe consider a space-division multiplexing system that sup- ports m spatial orthogonal propagation modes. Assuming a unitary coupling among all transmission modes the overall transfer matrix H can be described as an m × m unitary matrix, where each entry h ij represents the complex path gain from transmitted mode i to received mode j. We further assume a uniformly distributed unitary coupling, i.e., H is drawn uniformly from the ensemble of all m × m unitary matrices (Haar distributed). Considering a communication system where m t ≤ m and m r ≤ m modes are being addressed by the transmitter and receiver, respectively, the effective transfer matrix is a truncated version of H. Under these conditions the channel can be described as\n11 x + z , \t (1) where the vector x containing m t complex components, rep- resents the transmitted signal, the vector y containing m r complex components, represents the received signal, and z accounts for the presence of additive Gaussian noise. The m r components of z are statistically independent, circularly symmetric complex zero-mean Gaussian variables of unit energy E( |z j | 2 ) = 1. The components of x are constrained such that the average energy of each component is equal to 1, i.e., E( |x j | 2 ) = 1 for all j 1 . The term ρ ≥ 0 is proportional to the power per excited mode so that it equals to the signal- to-noise ratio in the single mode case (m = 1). The matrix H 11 is a block of size m r × m t within the m × m random unitary matrix H\nAs a ﬁrst stage in our analysis we establish the relation between the transfer matrix H 11 and the Jacobi ensemble of random matrices [1], [2]. Limiting our discussion to complex matrices we state the following deﬁnitions:\nDeﬁnition 1 (Gaussian ensemble). G(m, n) is m × n matrix of i.i.d complex entries distributed as CN (0, 1).\nDeﬁnition 2 (Wishart ensemble). W(m, n), where m ≥ n, is n × n Hermitian matrix which can be constructed as A \u2020 A,\nDeﬁnition 3 (Jacobi ensemble). J (m 1 , m 2 , n ), where m 1 , m 2 ≥ n, is n × n Hermitian matrix which can be constructed as A (A + B) −1 , where A and B are W(m 1 , n ) and W(m 2 , n ), respectively.\nThe ﬁrst two ensembles relate to wireless communication [5]. We claim here that the third classical ensemble, the Jacobi ensemble, is relevant to this channel model by relating its eigenvalues to the singular values of H 11 . To that end we quote the well-known [1] joint probability density function (PDF) of the ordered eigenvalues 0 ≤ λ 1 ≤ . . . ≤ λ n ≤ 1 of the Jacobi ensemble J (m 1 , m 2 , n )\n(3) where K m 1 ,m 2 ,n is a normalizing constant. We say that n variables follow the law of the Jacobi ensemble J (m 1 , m 2 , n ) if their joint PDF follows (3).\nWe shall now present the explicit distribution of the chan- nel\u2019s singular values by distinguishing between the following two cases:\nIn [9] it was shown that for m t , m r satisfying the con- ditions m t ≤ m r and m t + m r ≤ m, the eigenvalues of H \u2020 11 H 11 have the same distribution as the eigenvalues of the Jacobi ensemble J (m r , m − m r , m t ). For m t , m r satisfying m t > m r and m t + m r ≤ m, since H \u2020 share the same distribution with H, the eigenvalues of H 11 H \u2020 11 follow the law of the Jacobi ensemble J (m t , m − m t , m r ). Thus we can say that the squared non-zero singular values of H 11 share the same distribution with the eigenvalues of the Jacobi ensemble J (m max , m − m max , m min ), where and throughout this paper we denote m max = max {m t , m r } and m min = min {m t , m r }..\nThe following Lemma provides the joint PDF of the singular values of H 11 for cases in which m t , m r satisfy m t +m r > m.\nLemma 1. Suppose H is an m × m Haar distributed unitary matrix, divided into blocks as in (2), where H 11 is an m r ×m t block with m t + m r > m. Then m t + m r − m eigenvalues of H \u2020 11 H 11 are 1, m t − m min are 0 and m − m max equal the non-zeros eigenvalues of H \u2020 22 H 22 , thereby follow the law of the Jacobi ensemble J (m − m min , m min , m − m max ).\nIn the ergodic scenario the transmitted signal is assumed to sample the entire channel statistics. In this case the mutual information between the input and output of the channel is averaged with respect to all channel matrix realizations. Since we assume that the channel realization at each symbol time is known only at the receiver end, it can be shown [8] that an input vector of circularly symmetric zero-mean Gaussian\ncomponents with covariance matrix I m t maximizes the mutual information; thereby the ergodic capacity is\nThe following theorem gives an analytical expression to the ergodic capacity for the case where m t + m r ≤ m. Using the joint PDF of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi ensemble J (m max , m − m max , m min ) we associate the channel capacity with the Jacobi polynomials [10, 8.96].\nTheorem 1. The ergodic capacity of the channel deﬁned in (1), with m t , m r satisfying m t + m r ≤ m, reads\nApplying Lemma 1 to the channel capacity given by (4) readily results in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2. The ergodic capacity of the channel deﬁned in (1), with m t , m r satisfying m t + m r > m, satisﬁes\nwhere C ( 1, 1, 1; ρ ) is the SISO channel capacity C( 1, 1, 1; ρ ) = log(1 + ρ).\nNote that C ( m − m r , m − m t , m ; ρ ) is given by Theorem 1 and that the second term on the right-hand-side of (7) reduces to 0 when m t , or m r is equal to m. The form of Eq. (7) follows from the fact that k = m t + m r − m of the singular values are equal to unity, while the remaining singular values correspond to the Jacobi ensemble; hence the ergodic capacity is always at least k log(1+ρ). In Fig. 1 we present the ergodic capacity as a function of ρ for m = 4.\nIn the non-ergodic scenario the channel matrix is drawn randomly but rather assumed to be constant within the entire transmission period of each code-frame. The ﬁgure of merit in the non-ergodic case is the outage probability deﬁned as the probability that the mutual information induced by the channel realization is lower than the rate R at which the link is chosen to operate. Note that we assume that the channel instantiation is unknown to the transmitter, thus it can not adapt the transmission rate. However, the channel is assumed to be known at the receiver. By taking an input vector of circularly symmetric complex zero-mean Gaussian variables with covariance matrix Q the mutual information is maximized and the outage probability can be expressed as\n(8) where the minimization is over all covariance matrices Q satisfying the power constraint. The optimal choice of Q may depend on R and ρ and in general is unknown, even for the Rayleigh fading channel. Nevertheless, it can be shown that when ρ ≫ 1, the identity matrix I m t is approximately the optimal Q. In the following we make the simpliﬁed assumption that the transmitted covariance matrix is the commonly used choice Q = I m t . We denote the outage probability in this case\nNow, let the transmission rate be R = r log(1 + ρ) (bits/symbols) and let λ = {λ m min 1 } be the ordered non-zeros eigenvalues of H \u2020 11 H 11 . We can write\nwhere K m t ,m r ,m is a normalizing factor and B describes the outage event\nThis gives an analytical expression to the outage probability and is further exempliﬁed in Fig. 2.\nTheorem 3. The outage probability of the channel deﬁned in (1), with m t , m r satisfying m t + m r > m satisﬁes\nNote that the right-hand-side drops to 0, when m r , or m t equals m. Most importantly, when r < m t + m r − m, ˜ r = 0, implying that for such rates zero outage probability is achievable. A practical scheme for achieving zero outage under these conditions is proposed and discussed in [8]. In addition, when r ≥ m t + m r − m > 0, Eq. (12) implies that the outage probability is identical to that of a channel with m − m r modes addressed by the transmitter and m − m t modes addressed by the receiver, which is designed to support a transmission rate equivalent to ˜ r single-mode channels. Thus the right-hand-side of (12) applies to Eq. (11). In Fig. 2 we\nshow an exemplary calculation of the outage probability. These curves, obtained from our analysis were plotted in the same form as the numerical results reported in [7]. Note how the outage probability abruptly drops to 0 whenever r becomes smaller than m t + m r − m.\nUsing multiple modes/antennas is an important mean to improve performance in optical/wireless systems. The perfor- mance can be improved by increasing the transmission rate or by reducing the error probability. A coding scheme can achieve both performance gains, however there is a fundamen- tal tradeoff between how much each can get. This tradeoff is known as the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The optimal tradeoff for the Rayleigh fading channel was found in [11]. In this section we seek to ﬁnd the optimal tradeoff for the Jacobi channel.\nWe start by formalizing the concepts of diversity gain and multiplexing gain . To that end we quote some deﬁnitions from [11] 2 .\nDeﬁnition 4. Let a scheme be a family of codes C(ρ) of block length l, one at each ρ level. Let R (ρ) (bits/symbols) be the rate of the code C(ρ). A scheme C(ρ) is said to achieve spatial multiplexing gain r and diversity gain d if the data rate satisﬁes\nFor each r, deﬁne d ∗ (r) to be the supremum of the diversity advantage achieved over all schemes.\nTheorem 4. Suppose l ≥ m t +m r −1. The optimal DMT curve d ∗ (r) for the channel deﬁned in (1), with m t , m r satisfying m t + m r ≤ m, is given by the piecewise linear function that connects the points (k, d ∗ (k)) for k = 0, 1, · · · , m min , where\nd ∗ (k) = (m t − k)(m r − k) . \t (13) We refer the reader to [8] for further discussion about the\nTheorem 4 suggests that for m t + m r ≤ m, the optimal DMT curve does not depend on m. Note that m relates to the extent in which the elements of H 11 are mutually independent \u2013 the dependency is smaller as m is larger. Thus, at high SNR (ρ ≫ 1) and for m t + m r ≤ m, the impact of the correlation between the path gains on the error probability is negligible and the decaying order of the error probability behaves as in the Rayleigh channel (where the path gains are independent).\nAccording to Theorem 3 a zero outage probability is achiev- able for rates below (m t + m r − m) log(1 + ρ). Hence, for any (m t + m r − m) > δ > 0 there is a scheme C(ρ)\nwhere the rate of each code is (m t + m r − m − δ) log(1 + ρ) that achieve zero outage probability, thereby an exponentially decaying error probability. In this case the discussion about diversity is no longer of relevance. Nonetheless, one can think of the gain as inﬁnite. This reveals an interesting difference between the Jacobi and Rayleigh channels - the maximum diversity gain is \u201cunbounded\u201d as opposed to m r m t in the later case.\nTheorem 5. The optimal diversity multiplexing tradeoff curve d ∗ (r) for the channel deﬁned in (1), with m t , m r satisfying m t + m r ≤ m, is given by\n. d ∗ risdual (r) is the optimal curve for a channel with m − m r transmit and m − m t receive modes.\nNote that d ∗ risdual (r) is given by Theorem 4 for any block length l satisfying l ≥ m t + m r − 1. In Fig. 3 we show the optimal DMT curves for m t = m r = 2.\nThe Jacobi MIMO channel is deﬁned by the transfer matrix H 11 , a truncated m r × m t portion of an m × m Haar distributed unitary matrix. By establishing the relation between the channel\u2019s singular values and the Jacobi ensemble of random matrices we derived the ergodic capacity, outage probability and optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. An interesting phenomenon is observed when m t + m r > m: for any realization of H 11 , m t +m r −m singular values are 1. This results in an ergodic capacity which is at least m t + m r − m times the SISO capacity. In the non-ergodic scenario this results a promise for strictly zero outage probability and an exponentially decaying error probability (\u201cinﬁnite diversity\u201d) for any transmission rate below (m t + m r − m) log(1 + ρ).\nThe results here provide conceptual insights on MIMO channels. The size of the unitary matrix, m, can be viewed\nas the number of orthogonal propagation paths in space, whereas m t and m r are the number of addressed paths at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. For ﬁxed m t , m r , the parameter m may be deﬁned as the \u201cindependence measure\u201d of the channel. For example, when m t = m r = m the transfer matrix H 11 is unitary, all propagations paths are orthogonal and H 11 \u2019s elements are highly dependent. As m is larger, the orthogonality of the columns and rows of H 11 fades and the dependency between the path gains becomes weaker. Indeed, in [8] we show that as m increases, the Jacobi channel approaches to a Rayleigh channel in terms of the singular values statistics. Thus, the Jacobi model introduces new concepts in MIMO channel modeling, providing a degree of freedom to scale the MIMO model from a unitary channel up to a Rayleigh channel.\nWe gratefully acknowledge Amir Dembo for discussions on Lemma 1."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
