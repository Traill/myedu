For shifts of ﬁnite type (SFT), it is well known when we can embed one shift of ﬁnite type into another. The embedding theorem is composed of two conditions: the entropy condition and the periodic point condition (see [1] for example). However, this is not the case for the Dyck shift.\nRecently, Hamachi and Inoue have established embeddings of SFT into the Dyck shift. A necessary and sufﬁcient condi- tion for an irreducible shift of ﬁnite type to be embedded into a Dyck shift is given in [2], and it is extended to property A subshifts in [3].\nThe theory of constrained coding for SFT and soﬁc shifts is reasonably well developed. Recently, problems in genetic sequence modeling have motivated interest in constrained coding for certain context free languages, which are not SFT\u2019s or soﬁc [4]. The Dyck language and the Motzkin language are mathematical models of input constraints for genetic sequences. By using Sch¨utzenberger\u2019s method in automata the- ory [5], the forms of generating functions for several examples of constrained coding for the Dyck language are explicitly obtained in [4]. Topological entropies of such examples are computed in [6] by using their generating functions.\nTopological entropy of the Dyck shift D r (r ≥ 1) is already computed as log(1 + r) in [7]. As a circular code, the zeta function of the Dyck shift is already obtained in [8].\nThe Markov-Dyck shifts are generally introduced in [9]. Constrained codings for context-free languages considered in [4] and [6] can be regarded as examples of languages from Markov-Dyck shifts.\nIn this paper, we focus on an elementary but nontrivial example of the Markov-Dyck shifts, namely the Fibonacci- Dyck shift. Then we consider the embedding problem for\nSFT into the Fibonacci-Dyck shift. The existence of such embeddings is guaranteed by a general theory in [10]. In this research, we are interested in concrete constructions of such embeddings.\nIn [11], for all integers d ( ≥ 1), several classes of irreducible (d − 1)-step shifts of ﬁnite type were described in terms of a property A subshift, which was explicitly deﬁned in [2] for the Dyck shift. In particular, for even d, the limit of a sequence of topological entropies of a class of irreducible (d −1)-step SFT plays a crucial role in the embedding problem for SFT into the Dyck shift. We stress here that this value is not maximal. This condition is peculiar to the Dyck shift compared to the embedding condition for SFT. In this research, we compute this limit for the Fibonacci-Dyck shift.\nThis report is composed of seven sections. In Sect. II, we deﬁne the Fibonacci Dyck shift. In Sect. III, we give a counter example for the reﬂection principle in the Fibonacci-Dyck shift, which implies that the embedding problem in this study is not a direct consequence of the result in [2]. This is an important observation on basic properties of the Fibonacci- Dyck shift apart from the Dyck shift. In Sect. IV, we give an expression of the number of periodic points of length n whose multipliers are neutral in the Fibonacci-Dyck shift. In Sect. V, for all integers d ( ≥ 1), we deﬁne a few classes of irreducible (d − 1)-step SFT of the Fibonacci Dyck shift. For even d, we compute the limit of a sequence of topological entropies of a class of irreducible (d − 1)-step SFT. We also generalize this result to the Markov-Dyck shift. The report concludes with the summary in Sect. VI.\nLet Σ be a ﬁnite alphabet. We call elements β = β 1 β 2 · · · β n ∈ Σ n blocks over Σ of length n (n ≥ 1). We use Σ ∗ to denote the collection of all blocks over Σ and the empty block . The full Σ-shift is denoted by\nall n-blocks appearing in points in X. The language of X is the collection B(X) =\nTo deﬁne the Fibonacci-Dyck shift, we ﬁrst deﬁne the Dyck shift as follows. Set Σ = { , (, [, ], ), }. We deﬁne a inverse monoid (with zero) D: It has generators , (, [, ], ), and 111, whose relations are\nWe use red() to denote a mapping from Σ ∗ to the inverse monoid D by letting for α = α 1 α 2 · · · α n ∈ Σ ∗ (n ≥ 1),\nwhere x [i,j) = x i x i+1 · · · x j −1 for i, j ∈ Z with i < j. Deﬁnition 1: Let α, β ∈ Σ ∗ .\n1. If red(β) = 1 1 1, then β is said to be neutral. The empty block is neutral.\n2. If there exists a neutral block α such that β = α , (α), or [α], then β is called a nested block (α might happen to be the empty block).\n3. If red(β) is a ﬁnite concatenation of , ), and ], then β is said to be positive.\n4. If red(β) is a ﬁnite concatenation of , (, and [, then β is said to be negative.\n5. , ), and ] are called positive symbols, while , (, and [ are called negative symbols.\nNow we are in a position to introduce the Fibonacci-Dyck shift.\nLet F + = { ), ] , )), ]]} and F − = { [, ( , ((, [[}, which we will think of as being the forbidden blocks. We set F = F + ∪ F − . For F, we deﬁne X F to be the subset of sequences Σ Z which do not contain any block of F. The Fibonacci-Dyck shift D F is deﬁned by D F = D ∩ X F . The subshift D F is called \u201cFibonacci\u201d since the subset of sequences in D F which contain only negative symbols is nothing but the golden mean shift whose graph representation is shown in Fig. 1 (For the golden mean shift and its graph representation, see [1]). Symmetrically the subset of sequences in D F which contain only positive symbols is also the golden mean shift whose graph representation is obtained in Fig. 2 from Fig. 1 by reversing the direction of the edges and replacing the negative symbols , (, and [ with positive symbols\nIt is obvious that the following lemma holds not only for D but also for D F .\nLemma 1 ([2]): If β ∈ B(D), then there exists a neutral or positive block β + and a neutral or negative block β − such that β = β + β − . The factorization is unique up to neutral blocks.\nWe use P n (X) to denote the set of periodic points of period n in a subshift X. Let p n (X) denote the number of points in a subshift X having period of n.\nIn view of Fig. 1 and 2, for each even positive integer 2k (k ≥ 0), there exist two kinds of periodic deﬁning blocks in B 2k (D F ), namely, periodic deﬁning blocks that correspond to cycles that start and terminate at vertex 1 and the blocks that correspond to the cycles at vertex 2. We use b (1) 2k an b (2) 2k\nto denote the number of cycles of length 2k that start and terminate at vertex 1 and the number of the cycles at vertex 2 respectively.\nIn [2], periodic deﬁning blocks of D were described in terms of colorable paths of the symmetric random walk on Z. By virtue of the reﬂection principle in the paths characterized by D, an exact formula of p n (D) was given in [2]. Unfortunately, however, the reﬂection principle does not hold for the paths characterized by D F , which implies that the embedding prob- lem in this study is not a direct consequence of the result in [2]. This is an important observation on basic properties of D F . We give a counter example for the reﬂection principle in D F as follows.\nWe identify any periodic deﬁning block α = α 1 · · · α n ∈ B n (X), where X is D or D F , with a labeled zigzag line f = f 1 f 2 · · · f n deﬁned as follows: f starts from the origin of the 2-dimensional lattice plane. f i goes from (k, ) to (k+1, +1) or (k+1, −1) under the condition that α i is a negative symbol or a positive symbol respectively. In both cases, let the label of f i be α i .\nLet us consider periodic deﬁning blocks in B 2k (D). Then the number of the associated paths from (0, 0) to (2k, 0) that\nremain \u201cbelow\u201d the horizontal line except at the initial points is equal to the number of such paths that remain \u201cabove\u201d the horizontal line except at the initial points, which is given by 3 2k c k −1 , where c k is well known as the Catalan number:\nThe equality of the numbers of the above lower and upper paths is called the reﬂection principle [12].\nAs we see above, we have two kinds of periodic deﬁning blocks in B 2k (D F ). Let us consider the periodic deﬁning blocks that correspond to the cycles that start and terminate at vertex 1. Then, for 1 ≤ k ≤ 3, it is easy to check that the number of the associated paths from (0, 0) to (2k, 0) that remain below the horizontal line except at the initial points equals to the number of such paths that remain above the horizontal line except at the initial points. The reﬂection principle holds in these cases.\nOn the other hand, the following counter example demon- strates that the equality does not hold in general for the numbers of the above lower and upper paths characterized by the Fibonacci-Dyck shift D F . Namely, the reﬂection principle does not hold for the paths characterized by D F .\nExample 1: Consider the periodic deﬁning blocks in B 2k (D F ) that correspond to the cycles that start and terminate at vertex 2. Then the number of the associated paths from (0, 0) to (6, 0) that remain below the horizontal line except at the initial points is six while the number of such paths that remain above the horizontal line except at the initial points is seven. The set of the former paths is identiﬁed with\nTo state the embedding condition for the Fibonacci-Dyck shift D F concretely, we need asymptotic behaviour of the number of points in D F having period of 2k (k ≥ 0) whose multipliers are neutral.\nLet B 2k be a 2 × 2 diagonal matrix with diagonal element (b (1) 2k , b (2) 2k ). Formally it is obvious to claim\nProposition 1: The number of points in D F having period of n whose multipliers are neutral is given by {\ntr(B n ) (n : even), 0 \t (n : odd).\nIn what follows, we enumerate b (1) 2k and b (2) 2k by using gener- ating functions. We use k , () k , k , ][ k , [ ] k , and )( k to denote the number of periodic deﬁning blocks in B 2k (D F ) in the form\nof α , (α), α , ]α[, [α], and )α(, where α ∈ B 2(k −1) (D), respectively. By the deﬁnition, we have\nFor k ≥ 2, we obtain k =)( k = b (1) 2(k −1) , () k =][ k = b (2) 2(k −1) . We formally deﬁne generating functions:\nThus we obtain              \n            \ng b (1) (z) = g (z) {1 + 2z(g b (1) (z) + 2g b (2) (z)) } −z(g b (1) (z) + 2g b (2) (z))\n+2z 2 g b (2) (z)(g b (1) (z) + 2g b (2) (z)), g b (2) (z) = g [ ] (z)(1 + 2zg b (1) (z)) − zg b (1) (z),\ng (z) = 1 + z(g (z) {1 + 2z(g b (1) (z) + g b (2) (z)) } −z(g b (1) (z) + g b (2) (z)) +2z 2 g b (1) (z)g b (2) (z))),\n(2) By the deﬁnitions of these generating functions, for any k ≥ 0, we have d\n(1) , b (2) , , or [ ]. Thus the implicit function theorem leads to\nSimilar lengthy expressions are obtained for b (1) k , k , and [ ] k . Inductively we obtain a short table of values of b (1) 2k and b (2) 2k .\nk \t 0 1 2 \t 3 \t 4 b (1) 2k \t 1 4 21 108 621 b (2) 2k \t 1 2 9 48 261\nWe deﬁne several shifts of ﬁnite type (SFT) of D F . For each integers d ≥ 1, we deﬁne\nAll of these subshifts are irreducible (d − 1)-step SFT of D F . In particular, X d (D F ) plays important roles in the em-\nbedding problem for SFT into D F . To state the embedding condition for the Fibonacci-Dyck shift explicitly, we need the value of the limit lim d →∞ h(X d (D F )), where h(X) is the topological entropy of a subshift X.

First, we found the reﬂection principle failed for the path in the Fibonacci- Dyck shift. Then, we obtained the limit of a sequence of topological entropies of a class of irreducible (d −1)-step SFT of the Fibonacci-Dyck shift, where d ( ≥ 2) were even integers. Finally, we generalized the result on computing the above limit of a sequence of topological entropies to the Markov-Dyck shift.\nAcknowledgments.: This study was supported by the Grant- in-Aid for Scientiﬁc Research (C) under Grant No. 24560445 from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
