Particular attention has been invested in problem instances where the available in- formation is limited and noisy, and where the signals of interest possess a low-dimensional geometric struc- ture. Examples of such instances include morphological component analysis [1]; sparse approximation and com- pressive sensing [2, 3]; and afﬁne rank minimization [4].\nIn this work, we will study a very general version of the linear inverse problem. Suppose that the signal of interest x ∗ can be written as the sum of two constituent signals a ∗ ∈ A and b ∗ ∈ B, where A, B are arbitrary nonlinear sub-manifolds of the signal space R N . We are given access to noisy linear measurements of x ∗ :\nz = Φ(a ∗ + b ∗ ) + e, \t (1) where Φ ∈ R M ×N is the measurement matrix. Our objective is to recover the pair of signals (a ∗ , b ∗ ), and thus also x ∗ , from z. At the outset, numerous obstacles arise while trying to solve (1), some that might appear to be insurmountable:\nIdentiﬁability I. Consider even the simplest case where the measurements are noiseless and the measurement\noperator is the identity, i.e., we observe x ∈ R N such that x = a ∗ + b ∗ . In this case, x contains 2N unknowns but only N observations and hence is fundamentally ill-posed. Unless we make additional assumptions on the geometric structure of the component manifolds A and B, a unique decomposition of x into its constituent signals (a ∗ , b ∗ ) may not exist.\nIdentiﬁability II. To complicate matters, in more general situations the linear operator Φ in (1) might have fewer rows that columns, so that M < N . Thus, Φ possesses a nontrivial nullspace. Indeed, we are particularly inter- ested in cases where M \t N , i.e., the nullspace of Φ is extremely large relative to the ambient space. This further emphasizes the problem of identiﬁability of the ordered pair (a ∗ , b ∗ ), given the available observations z. Nonconvexity. Even if the above identiﬁability issues were resolved, the manifolds A, B might be extremely nonconvex, or even non-differentiable. Thus, classical numerical methods, such as Newton\u2019s method or steepest descent, cannot be applied; neither can the litany of convex optimization methods that have been designed for linear inverse problems with certain types of signal priors [3, 4].\nIn this paper, we propose a simple method called Successive Projection onto INcoherent manifolds (SPIN) to recover the component signals (a ∗ , b ∗ ) from z. De- spite the highly nonconvex nature of the problem and the possibility of underdetermined measurements, SPIN provably recovers the signal components a ∗ and b ∗ . For this to hold true, we will require that (i) the signal manifolds A, B are incoherent, in the sense that the secants of A are almost orthogonal to the secants of B; and (ii) the measurement operator Φ satisﬁes a certain restricted isometry property (RIP) on the secants of the direct sum manifold C = A ⊕ B. We will formally deﬁne these conditions in Section II.\nSPIN is iterative in nature. Each iteration consists of three steps: computation of the gradient of the error function ψ(a, b) = 1 2 z − Φ(a + b) 2 , forming signal proxies for a and b, and orthogonally projecting the\nproxies onto the manifolds A and B. The projection op- erators onto the component manifolds play a crucial role in algorithm stability and performance; some manifolds admit stable, efﬁcient projection operators while others do not. Interestingly, SPIN exhibits a convergence rate comparable to several state-of-the-art algorithms [5, 6], despite the nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the above reconstruction problem.\nThe core essence of our proposed approach has been extensively studied in a number of different contexts. In particular, SPIN is an iterative projected gradient method with the same basic approach as two recent signal recov- ery algorithms \u2014 Gradient Descent with Sparsiﬁcation (GraDeS) [5] and Manifold Iterative Pursuit (MIP) [7]. Our method generalizes these approaches to situations where the signal of interest is a linear mixture of signals arising from a pair of nonlinear manifolds. Due to this particular structure of our setting, SPIN consists of two projection steps (instead of one), and the analysis is more complicated. An appealing feature of our method is its conceptual simplicity plus its ability to generalize to mixtures of arbitrary nonlinear manifolds.\nOwing to space constraints, we state our theoretical claims and only provide a brief outline of the proofs fol- lowing each statement. Refer to the extended version of this paper [8] for a thorough discussion of our approach, with complete proofs and additional applications.\nThe analysis and proof of accuracy of SPIN (Algo- rithm 1) involves three core ingredients: (i) a geomet- ric notion of manifold incoherence that crystallizes the approximate orthogonality between secants of submani- folds of R N , (ii) a restricted isometry condition satisﬁed by the measurement operator Φ over the secants of a submanifold, and (iii) the availability of projection operators that compute the orthogonal projection of any point x ∈ R N onto a submanifold of R N .\nGiven a manifold A ⊂ R N , a normalized secant, or simply, a secant, u ∈ R N of A is a unit vector such that\nThe secant manifold S(A) is the family of all unit vectors u generated by pairs a, a belonging to A.\nIn linear inverse problems such as sparse signal ap- proximation and compressive sensing, the assumption of incoherence between linear subspaces, bases, or dic- tionary elements is common. We introduce a nonlinear generalization of this concept via the secant manifold.\nDeﬁnition 1: Suppose A, B are submanifolds are R N . Let\nwhere S(A), S(B) are the secant manifolds of A, B respectively. Then, A and B are called -incoherent manifolds.\nBy deﬁnition, the quantity is always positive; further, ≤ 1, due to the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. We prove\nthat any signal x belonging to the direct sum A ⊕ B can be uniquely decomposed into its constituent signals, when the upper bound on holds with strict inequality.\nLemma 1 (Uniqueness): Suppose that A, B are - incoherent with < 1. Consider x = a + b = a + b , where a, a ∈ A and b, b ∈ B. Then, a = a , b = b .\nProof sketch. Let x 1 = a + b, and x 2 = a + b . Expand the relation x 1 − x 2 2 = 0, and apply the inequality between the arithmetic and geometric means to obtain the uniqueness result.\nIn Section III, we will see that the condition for exact recovery of (a, b) from x will require a mild tightening of the upper bound on .\nWe address the situation when the measurement oper- ator Φ ∈ R M ×N contains a nontrivial nullspace, i.e., when M < N . We will require that Φ satisﬁes a restricted isometry criterion on the secants of the direct sum manifold C = A ⊕ B.\nDeﬁnition 2: Let C be a submanifold of R N . Then, the matrix Φ ∈ R M ×N satisﬁes the restricted isometry property (RIP) on C with constant δ ∈ [0, 1) if, for every normalized secant u belonging to the secant manifold S(C), we have that\nThe notion of restricted isometry (and its general- izations) is an important component in the analysis of many algorithms in sparse approximation, compressive sensing, and low-rank matrix recovery [3, 4]. While the RIP has traditionally been studied in the context of sparse signal models, (3) generalizes of this notion to arbitrary nonlinear manifolds. A key result [9] states that under certain upper bounds on the curvature of the manifold C, there exist probabilistic constructions of matrices Φ ∈ R M ×N that satisfy the RIP on C such that the number of rows of Φ is proportional to the intrinsic dimension of C, rather than the ambient dimension N of the signal space.\nInputs: Observation matrix Φ, measurements z, pro- jection operators P A (·), P B (·), number of iterations T , step size η\nOutputs: Estimated signal components a ∈ A, b ∈ B Initialize: a 0 = 0, b 0 = 0, r = z, k = 0 while k ≤ T do\na k+1 ← P A (a k ), b k+1 ← P B (b k ) r ← z − Φ(a k+1 + b k+1 ) k ← k + 1\nGiven an arbitrary nonlinear manifold A ∈ R N , we deﬁne the operator P A (·) as the Euclidean projection projector onto A:\nWe observe that for arbitrary nonconvex manifolds A, the minimization problem (4) may not yield a unique optimum. Technically, therefore, P A (x) is a set-valued operator. For ease of exposition, P A (x) will henceforth refer to any arbitrarily chosen element of the set of signals that minimize the 2 -error in (4).\nWe propose an efﬁcient algorithm to solve the linear inverse problem (1) and detail it in pseudocode form in Algorithm 1. The algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of ﬁrst order recovery methods that have been developed for a number of different models [5, 7]. The key innovation in SPIN is that we formulate two proxy vectors for the signal components, a k and b k , and project these onto the corresponding manifolds A and B.\nWe show that SPIN possesses strong uniform recovery guarantees , even under the presence of limited and highly inaccurate measurements. These guarantees are comparable to those exhibited by existing state-of-the-art signal recovery algorithms for sparse approximation and compressive sensing, while encompassing a very broad range of nonlinear signal models.\nTheorem 1 (Stable recovery): Suppose A, B are - incoherent manifolds in R N . Let Φ be a measurement matrix with restricted isometry constant δ over the direct sum manifold C = A ⊕ B. Suppose we observe noisy linear measurements z = Φ(a ∗ + b ∗ ) + e, where a ∗ ∈\nA, b ∗ ∈ B. Suppose 0 ≤ δ < (1 − 11 )/(3 + 7 ). Then, SPIN (Algorithm 1) with step size η = 1/(1 + δ) and projection operators P A , P B outputs a T ∈ A, b T ∈ B such that z − Φ(a T + b T ) 2 ≤ β e 2 + ν in no more than T = \t 1 log(1/α) log z 2 2ν iterations for any ν > 0. Here, α, β are moderately sized positive constants.\nProof sketch. For a given set of measurements z obeying (1), deﬁne the error function ψ : A × B → R as: ψ(a, b) = 1 2 z − Φ(a + b) 2 . In the extended version of this paper [8], we show that at any iteration k, the SPIN signal estimates satisfy the relation\nEquation (5) describes a linear recurrence relation for the sequence of positive real numbers ψ(a k , b k ), k = 0, 1, 2, . . . with leading coefﬁcient α < 1. By the choice of initialization, ψ(a 0 , b 0 ) = z 2 2 . Therefore, for all k ∈ N, we have the relation\nSome implications of Theorem 1 are as follows. For the special case where there is no measurement noise (i.e., e = 0), Theorem 1 states that after a ﬁnite number of iterations, SPIN outputs signal component estimates (a, b) such that z − Φ(a + b) < ν for any desired precision parameter ν. Since we can set ν to an arbitarily small value, we have that the SPIN estimates (a, b) converges to the true signals (a ∗ , b ∗ ).\nFurther, suppose that the one of the components manifolds is the trivial (zero) manifold; then we have that = 0. In this case, SPIN reduces to the Manifold Iterative Pursuit (MIP) algorithm for recovering signals from a single manifold [7]. Moreover, the condition on δ reduces to 0 ≤ δ < 1/3, which exactly matches the condition required for guaranteed recovery using MIP.\nLastly, the condition in Theorem 1 on the inequalities linking the isometry constant δ and the manifold incoher- ence parameter implies that < 1/11. This represents a mild tightening of the condition on required for a unique decomposition (Lemma 1), even with full measurements (i.e., when Φ is the identity operator, or more generally, when δ = 0).\nThe two-manifold signal model described in this paper is applicable to a wide variety of problems. We discuss two representative instances.\nConsider the set of signals M ⊂ R N that are gen- erated by varying K parameters θ ∈ Θ, Θ ⊂ R K . Then, we say that the signals trace out a nonlinear K-dimensional articulation manifold in R N , where θ is called the articulation parameter vector. Examples of articulation manifolds include: 1D acoustic chirps of varying frequencies (where θ represents the chirp rate); 2D images of a white disk translating on a black background (where θ represents the planar location of the disk center); and 2D images of a 3D object with variable pose (where θ represents the 6D pose parameters, three corresponding to spatial location and three corresponding to orientation).\nWe consider the class of compact, smooth K- dimensional articulation manifolds M ⊂ R N . For such manifolds, it has been shown [9] that there exist ran- domized constructions of measurement operators Φ ∈ R M ×N that satisfy the RIP on the secants of M with constant δ, and with probability at least ρ, provided\nfor some constant C M that depends only on the smooth- ness and volume of the manifold M. Therefore, the range space of Φ is proportional merely to the number of articulation parameters K, and only logarithmic in the ambient dimension N . Moreover, given such a mea- surement matrix Φ with isometry constant δ < 1/3 and a projection operator P M (·) onto M, any signal x ∈ M can be reconstructed from its compressive measurements y = Φx using Manifold Iterative Pursuit (MIP) [7].\nWe generalize this setting to the case where the unknown signal of interest arises as a mixture of signals from two manifolds A and B. For instance, suppose we are interested in the space of 2D images, where the manifolds A, B comprise of translations of ﬁxed template images I A (t), I B (t), where t denotes the 2D domain over which the image is deﬁned. Then, the signal of interest is a 2D image of the form\nwhere θ 1 , θ 2 denote the unknown translation parameters. The problem is to recover (a ∗ , b ∗ ), or equivalently (θ 1 , θ 2 ), given the measurements z = Φ(a ∗ + b ∗ ).\nWe demonstrate that SPIN offers an easy, efﬁcient technique to recover the component images. Figure 1(a)\ndisplays the results of SPIN recovery of a 64 × 64 image from merely M = 50 random Gaussian measurements. The unknown image consists of the linear sum of arbitrary translations of template images I A (t), I B (t). Here, the templates I A (t), I B (t) are assumed to be smoothed 0/1 images on a black background of a white disk and a white square respectively. From Fig. 1 we observe that SPIN is able to perfectly recover the com- ponent signals from very limited observations. Here, the operator P A (x) onto the manifold A consists of running a matched ﬁlter between the template I(t) and the input signal x, and returning I(t + θ), where the parameter value θ corresponds to the 2D location of the maximum of the matched ﬁlter response. This can be very efﬁciently carried out in O (N log N ) operations using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\nIn some situations, the signal of interest x might be corrupted with impulsive noise (or shot noise) prior to signal acquisition via linear measurements. For example, consider Fig. 2(a), where the Gaussian pulse is the signal of interest and the spikes correspond to the undesirable noise. In this case, the linear observations are more accurately modeled as\nand n is a K -sparse signal in the canonical basis. Therefore, SPIN can be used to recover x from z, provided that the manifold M is incoherent with the set of sparse signals Σ K , and Φ satisﬁes the RIP on the direct sum M ⊕ Σ K .\nFigure 2 displays the results of a numerical experiment that illustrates the utility of SPIN in this setting. We consider a manifold of 1D signals of length N = 10000 comprising shifts of a Gaussian pulse of ﬁxed width g 0 ∈ R N . The unknown signal x is an element of this manifold M and is corrupted by K = 10 spikes of unknown magnitudes and locations. This degraded signal\nis sampled using M = 150 random measurements to obtain an observation vector z. For this problem, the projection operator P M (·) consists of a matched ﬁlter with the template pulse g 0 , while the projection operator P Σ K (·) simply returns the best K -term approximation in the canonical basis. Assuming that we have knowledge of the number of nonzeros in the noise vector n, we can use SPIN to reconstruct both x and n. We observe from Fig. 2(b) that SPIN recovers the true signal x with near- perfect accuracy.\nFigure 3 plots the number of measurements M vs. the signal reconstruction error (normalized relative to the signal energy, and plotted in dB). We observe that by increasing M , we can tolerate an increased number K\nof nuisance spikes; we can show that this relationship between M and K is in fact linear [8]. This result can be extended to any situation where the signals of interest obey a \u201chybrid\u201d model that is a mixture of a nonlinear manifold and the set of sparse signals.\nWe have proposed a projected gradient-descent algo- rithm (SPIN) for the recovery of signals originating from a pair of incoherent manifolds, given limited and noisy measurements of their linear sum. For clarity and brevity,\nwe have focused our attention on signals belonging to the direct sum of two signal manifolds. However, SPIN (and its accompanying proof mechanism) can be conceptually extended to sums of any ﬁnite number Q of manifolds. Refer to the extended version of this paper [8] for full proofs, detailed discussions, and a comparison of SPIN to classical approaches.\nThis work was supported by the grants NSF CCF-0431150, CCF-0926127, and CCF-1117939; DARPA/ONR N66001-11-C-4092 and N66001-11-1- 4090; ONR N00014-08-1-1112, N00014-10-1-0989, and N00014-11-1-0714; AFOSR FA9550-09-1-0432; ARO MURI W911NF-07-1-0185 and W911NF-09-1-\n0383; and the Texas Instruments Leadership University Program."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
