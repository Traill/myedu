It is shown that a simple Han-Kobayashi (HK) linear Gaussian superposition coding scheme with a public/private message split at each transmitter can achieve the GMGR of the channel if the covariance matrices associated with the private and public sub-message codewords at each transmitter are certain functions of the null-space of the respective cross-link channel matrix.

These results are derived for ﬁxed or time-invariant channel matrices which are hence assumed to be known at all the nodes. However, in wireless fading channels, the knowledge of the channel matrices must be provided to the transmitters by the receivers via a feedback channel which may potentially require a large system bandwidth. On the other hand, with no CSIT whatso- ever, the achievable throughput of a network can degrade to an extent that even the degrees of freedom or multiplexing gain are reduced (cf. [5]). This leads to the natural question as to what and how much partial CSIT must be fed back from the receivers to the transmitters per channel realization so as to attain the perfect CSIT performance.\nIn this paper, we characterize the generalized multiplexing gain region (GMGR) of the slow-fading MIMO IC under the\nperfect CSIT assumption and answer the above question with a sufﬁcient condition on the number of feedback bits per channel realization needed to achieve the perfect CSIT GMGR. The GMGR of the network is the set of simultaneously achievable multiplexing gains achievable by the transmit/receive pairs so that the corresponding diversity order of the overall outage probability is strictly greater than zero, with the direct link signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and the cross-link interference- to-noise ratios (INRs) allowed to vary while maintaining arbitrary but ﬁxed ratios with respect to a nominal SNR on the dB scale. In general, the GMGR on an interference network plays the role of multiplexing gain on a point-to-point channel except for the fact that SNRs and INRs of the different links now can have different SNR exponents as just described.\nFirst, the GMGR of the MIMO IC if characterized under the perfect CSIT assumption. A simple HK coding scheme with two-level linear Gaussian superposition coding, no time sharing and channel dependent covariance matrices for each users messages is shown to be GMGR optimal. It is shown that at each transmitter the covariance matrices of the private and the public sub-message codewords are functions of the null space of the corresponding cross-link channel matrix. Subsequently, we propose a partial CSIT scheme and show that it is sufﬁcient to feedback this null space information to T x i using only N j (N j − M i ) + log(ρ ij ) number of bits 1 from Rx j to achieve the FCSIT GMGR (e.g., see Theorem 2). Moreover, we also derive the GMGR under the no CSIT assumption for MIMO ICs for which (a) M i ≤ N j for i = j ∈ {1, 2} and (b) M 1 ≤ N 2 ≤ N 1 (or M 2 ≤ N 1 ≤ N 2 ) under the strong interference regime where the INR is larger than the SNR at each of the receivers.\nThe general two-user MIMO IC is considered in which transmitter i (T x i ) has M i antennas and receiver i (Rx i ) has N i antennas, respectively for i = 1, 2, and is referred to henceforth as the (M 1 , N 1 , M 2 , N 2 ) MIMO IC. Let H ij ∈ C N j ×M i model the channel matrix between T x i and Rx j , for i, j = 1, 2. We consider quasi-static fading so that while these matrices are constant for the duration of a codeword, they change independently across codewords with an identical distribution. For economy of notation, these matrices will henceforth together be denoted as H.\nThe channel matrices in H are assumed to be mutually independent and are drawn from a unitarily invariant distribu- tion [6], i.e., if U ∈ U N j ×N j and V ∈ U M i ×M i then, U H ij V and H ij are identically distributed. In addition, the matrices are assumed to be full rank with probability 1 (w.p.1) and the probability density functions (pdfs) of the eigenvalues are assumed to have a polynomial behavior near zero (i.e., when λ ≈ ρ −δ , for some δ > 0). This is a broad class of channel statistics 2 , including the well known Rayleigh distribution.\nDenoting the transmitted signal from T x i , at time t as X it ∈ C M i ×1 , the received signals at the two receivers can be written as\nwhere Z it ∈ C N i ×1 are i.i.d as CN (0, I N i ) across i and t, SNR ii and INR ij represent the average SNR at receiver i and INR at receiver j for i = j ∈ {1, 2}, respectively. The input signals satisfy the following power constraint:\n1 n\nwhere n represents the channel coherence period length, i.e., the number of channel uses for which the channel remains constant. In what follows, we shall denote the SNR and INR at receiver i by ρ ii and ρ ji , respectively, for i = j ∈ {1, 2}.\nFinally, to capture the effects of different relative strengths of the various links we let the SNRs and INRs to vary exponentially with respect to a nominal SNR, ρ, with different exponents as follows:\nand i, j ∈ {1, 2}. In what follows, ¯ ρ \t [ρ 11 , ρ 12 , ρ 21 , ρ 22 ] and ¯ α [α 11 , α 12 , α 21 , α 22 ] shall be used to describe the SNRs and INRs of the channel, whichever is more appropriate. Without loss of generality, we let the direct link SNR of transmitter/receiver pair 1 to be the nominal SNR, so that α 11 = 1.\nThe notion of generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) region as described in [1], [4] for the ﬁxed interference channel is of course not valid when there is fading. However, for a given channel realization H, upper and lower bounds to the instantaneous mutual information region of the channel can be found as in Lemma 1 and 4 of [2]. These bounds can be used to form lower and upper bounds respectively to the outage probability of the channel. In fact, a high SNR analysis of these bounds was undertaken in [8] for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading to obtain the well-known diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the MIMO IC for the symmetric case (i.e., with an equal\nnumber of antennas at the four nodes and with α ii = 1 and α ij = α). See also [9]. In this work, we consider the more general class of fading distributions as described earlier in this section as well as general numbers of antennas at the four terminals and general SNR exponents ¯ α but specialize our attention to the GMGR, which is simply the set of multiplexing gains over which the diversity order of the overall outage probability is positive, rather than characterize the precise diversity gain over this GMGR. The GMGR is formally deﬁned next.\nConsider two codebook at the two transmitters with code- book of T x i having rate R i and with codewords satisfying the average power constraint. A family of such permissible codes, one for each nominal SNR ρ, is a permissible coding scheme. The multiplexing gain pair of this coding scheme is denoted as (r 1 , r 2 ) where\nOn the other hand, if P e ( ¯ ρ, r 1 , r 2 ) represents the maximum of the average probability of error at the receivers at a multiplexing gain pair (r 1 , r 2 ) and nominal SNR of ρ, then the corresponding diversity order is deﬁned as\nA multiplexing gain pair, (r 1 , r 2 ), is said to be achiev- able if there exists a permissible coding scheme for which d IC (r 1 , r 2 ) > 0.\nDeﬁnition 1: The generalized multiplexing gain region is the closure of the set of all achievable multiplexing gain pairs of the channel, and is denoted as M o ( ¯ α), so that\nIn this section, we derive the GMGR M o ( ¯ ρ) of the (M 1 , N 1 , M 2 , N 2 ) MIMO IC under the CSIT assumption. We also analyze the form in which the CSIT is used by a GMGR optimal coding scheme. For brevity, we refer to the perfect CSIT GMGR of the MIMO IC simply as its GMGR.\nLet us denote by HK (K 1u , K 1w , K 2u , K 2w ) = HK ∗ a simple Han-Kobayashi (HK) linear Gaussian superposition coding scheme where the i th user\u2019s message is divided into two sub-messages, namely the private message and the public message, and where these sub-messages are encoded using mutually independent Gaussian codewords having mean zero and covariance matrix K iu and K iw , respectively for i = 1, 2. Hence, the codeword transmitted by user i can be written as\nwhere U it ∼ CN (0, K iu ) and W it ∼ CN (0, K iw ) are independent, identically distributed (iid) across time.\nTheorem 1: a.

Putting this into the left hand side of equation (11) we have\nA consequence of this fact is that, to achieve the GMGR of the channel neither of the transmitters require any CSI. Thus, in what follows, without loss of generality, we shall consider the M i > N j=i case only.\nOutline of the Proof of Theorem 1: First we derive a set of upper bounds (representing a set of rate tuples R u (H, ¯ ρ)) to the instantaneous capacity or mutual information region, C(H, ¯ ρ), of the channel and a set of achievable rate tuples R a (H, ¯ ρ), achievable by the HK ∗ scheme. Both R u (H, ¯ ρ) and R a (H, ¯ ρ) are dependent on the instantaneous channel realization and hence are random but satisfy the following set inequality\nUsing this set upper and lower bounds to the instantaneous mutual information region of the channel we next derive an upper and a lower bound to the DMT of the channel following similar method as in [10], which in turn gives us a corresponding set of upper and lower bounds to the GMGR of the channel. It can be further proved that, these two bounds coincide, yielding the fundamental GMGR of the channel if K iu of HK ∗ satisfy equation (11), which proves the second part of the Theorem. The detailed proof can be found in [11].\nThe achievable scheme HK ∗ is different from that used in [2] in the choice of the covariance matrices K iu for the private sub-message at transmitter i. On the one hand, even though it is not clear how close the instantaneous mutual information regions R a (H, ¯ ρ) and R u (H, ¯ ρ) are from each other (whereas these are within a bounded gap of each other for the achievable scheme in [2]), HK ∗ is nevertheless GMGR region optimal if the condition (11) is satisﬁed. On the other hand, as be show in the next section, the choice of the covariance matrices K iu herein facilitates the formulation of the ﬁnite rate feedback problem and its solution.\nLet us now consider how much CSIT is required to imple- ment the coding scheme HK ∗ . It is clear from Theorem 1 that, to achieve the GMGR of the channel the V i \u2019s should be chosen such that (11) is satisﬁed. Such a choice of V i cannot in general be independent of the channel state information. Moreover, this is not the only step that requires CSIT. For every choice of multiplexing gain tuple (r 1 , r 2 ) ∈ M o ( ¯ ρ) each transmitter must chose the corresponding information rates for its private and public messages, respectively. It is a well-known fact that such rate split depends on the instantaneous channel matrices if the transmitters want to achieve each rate tuple in R a (H, ¯ ρ). Interestingly, in [11] a multiplexing-gain splitting strategy is suggested which is independent of any CSIT. In other words, to achieve the GMGR region of the channel CSIT is required only to construct V i \u2019s which satisfy equation (11).\nIt is proved in [11] that to construct such a V i at transmitter i, it is sufﬁcient to know the null space of the cross link channel matrix H ij . That is if\nwhere U ij ∈ U N j ×N j and V ij ∈ U M i ×M i are unitary matrices, m ij = min{M i , N j } and Σ + ij is a diagonal matrix containing the non-zero singular values of the matrix, then the knowledge of the subspace spanned by the last (M i − N j ) + columns of the matrix V ij , denoted by S i is sufﬁcient.\nThe detailed proof of this result is provided in [11] and is not included here due to space restrictions. Intuitively, the left hand side of (11) can be shown to be equal to I(U i ; Y j |X j , W i ), i.e., the contribution of the private message U i at receiver j. As a result, if the transmitter knows the null space of the cross link it can direct the private message into the null-space so that its contribution is limited at receiver j.\nConsequently, knowledge of CSI at the transmitters boils down to the knowledge of a particular subspace, S i . However, to feedback S i exactly to T x i , Rx j still requires an inﬁnite number of feedback bits when M i > N j . On the other hand, since S i is a subspace of C M i , it can be thought of as a point in a Grassmann manifold which we deﬁne next.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Grassmann manifold): The \t Grassmann manifold G n,p is the set of all p-dimensional subspaces (planes passing through the origin) in the n-dimensional Euclidean space C n .\nLet V n,p≤n be the set of p-dimensional bases, of the n- dimensional complex space C n , a point in which can be represented by an n × p matrix with orthonormal columns. Then, a point (which represents a particular subspace, say S o ) in the Grassmann manifold G n,p is equivalent to the set of all n × p orthonormal matrices in V n,p whose columns span the same subspace S o . Clearly, the matrix representation of a point in G n,p is non-unique.\nThat is, for each channel realization of H ij , Rx j needs to feedback a point from the corresponding Grassman manifold to T x i , if M i > N j . Using this concept in the next section, we shall show that it is possible to feedback only an approximate version of S i represented through a ﬁnite number of feedback bits and yet satisfy the constraint in (11).\nDue to space constraints, we shall provide in what follows an intuitive picture of how the Grassmann manifold is quan- tized and the corresponding ﬁnite rate feedback scheme.\nThe problem that we deal with in this section can be conceptually explained by Fig. 1(a). Suppose for M i > N j , the outer circle represents the Grassmann manifold G M i ,(M i −N j ) . For a given channel realization, S i represents an arbitrary point in the circular region of Fig. 1(a). From the previous discussion we know that, in the HK ∗ scheme T x i needs to know S i , to achieve the perfect CSIT GMGR of the channel. However, to send this point exactly, Rx j requires an inﬁnite number\nof feedback bits, because it is one of the inﬁnite number of points lying in the circular region. Our goal in this section is to represent all the points in the bigger circle, approximately, by a ﬁnite number of points.\nThat is, suppose we pack maximum number of non- intersecting smaller circles with a particular radius within the outer circle and then construct a quantization codebook, C i , whose codewords are the centers of these smaller circles. For each occurrence of a random point S i , Rx j identiﬁes the circle whose center or codeword is the nearest among all the circles and sends back its center to T x i . For example, consider the area ABCD in the ﬁgure; any point lying in this region is nearest to the codeword F and thus whenever S i lies in this area Rx j feeds back the codeword F. This area ABCD is called the Voronoi region corresponding to the codeword F. Note that Rx j requires only log(|C i |) bits to send the index of the codeword if the codebooks are revealed to the transmitters before data transmission begins. The required number of feedback bits can be further reduced if we allow a smaller number of circles as shown in Fig. 1(b), where clearly the Voronoi regions are much larger than those in Fig. 1(a). Essentially, we are approximating all the points within the Voronoi region of a codeword by that point and the error due to approximation increases as the Voronoi regions gets larger. For example, if the approximation error is a monotonic function of the distance between a point and its codeword, then clearly the codebook in ﬁgure 1(b) will incur a larger approximation error than the codebook of ﬁgure 1(a). Evidently, as the number of codewords and consequently the number of required feedback bits decreases, the approximation error increases and hence there is a tradeoff between the two.\nCharacterization of this tradeoff allows us to evaluate the minimum number of feedback bits required under the con- straint that the approximation error does not go beyond a threshold value, where the threshold is set according to some requirement. In particular, if S i is approximated by ˆ S i and covariance matrix for the private message of T x i constructed from this approximate point is denoted by ˆ K iu , then we say that the error is below threshold if\nwhere ˆ c i is independent of ρ ij . This choice of the threshold gives us the minimum number of feedback bits required to achieve the GMGR of the channel which is stated in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2: For \t each \t channel \t realization, (N j (M i − N j ) + ) α ij log(ρ) number of feedback bits from Rx j to T x i are sufﬁcient to achieve the perfect CSIT GMGR of the (M 1 , N 1 , M 2 , N 2 ) MIMO IC. In particular, if the feedback bits are used to send an approximate copy of the subspace S i following the feedback scheme described below then the corresponding coding scheme can achieve the entire perfect CSIT GMGR of the channel.\nIn this section, we shall derive the GMGR of the MIMO IC without CSIT for some speciﬁc antenna conﬁgurations. The\nconverse is based on the F-CSIT result derived in previous sections, since as a set of multiplexing gain tuples the GMG region of the MIMO IC with F-CSIT is a superset which contains the GMG region of the MIMO IC without CSIT. The achievable schemes are different for different antenna conﬁgurations considered but can achieve the converse bounds without CSIT. We start with the case when M i ≤ N j for both i = j ∈ {1, 2}.\nCorollary 1: Consider the (M 1 , N 1 , M 2 , N 2 ) MIMO IC with channel parameter ¯ α and N j ≥ M i for all i = j ∈ {1, 2}. The No-CSIT GMGR, M No-CSIT 1 ( ¯ α), on this channel is identical to the perfect CSIT GMGR, i.e.,\nRemark 2: In [12] the DMT of the 2-user SISO IC with α 12 = α 21 = α and α 11 = α 22 = 1 was derived which also characterizes the MGR of the channel. When specialized to the case with M 1 = N 1 = M 2 = N 2 = 1 and α 12 = α 21 = α, the above theorem recovers this MGR region of the 2-user SISO IC. From the DMT perspective however, the analysis of [12] is more general because it characterizes the fundamental diversity order at all multiplexing gain pairs too.\nIf we restrict ourselves to the symmetric IC with stronger interference than the desired signal, then the No-CSIT GMGR result can be extended to more general antenna conﬁgurations as characterized by the next theorem.\nTheorem 3: Consider the (M 1 , N 1 , M 2 , N 2 ) MIMO IC with ¯ α = [1, α, α, 1] where α ≥ 1 and either M 1 ≤ N 2 ≤ N 1 or M 2 ≤ N 1 ≤ N 2 .\n\u2022 The GMG region of such a MIMO IC without CSIT is given as\nwhere D 3 and D 4 are as deﬁned in the 3 rd and 4 th inequalities in Theorem 1, respectively.\n\u2022 The entire GMGR can be achieved, using the HK 0 M 1 , 1 M\nI M 2 coding scheme. Proof: The detailed proof can be found in [11].\nIntuitively, when M 1 ≤ N 2 ≤ N 1 , T x 1 sends only a public message since the cross-link has no null space and α ≥ 1. Therefore, Rx 2 can decode both the message of T x 1 and T x 2 completely. Moreover, since Rx 1 has a larger receive dimension than Rx 2 , Rx 1 can decode both the messages as well. So, T x 2 can also send only a public message and thus does not need to use its cross-link null space. Hence, neither of the transmitters need any CSI to achieve the perfect CSIT GMGR of the channel.\nThe generalized multiplexing gain region of the two-user slow fading MIMO interference channel (IC) with perfect CSIT is established. The number of feedback bits required per channel realization to achieve this region with only quantized\nCSI feedback is characterized. Moreover, the No-CSIT GMGR of two classes of MIMO ICs is given where the lack of CSIT does not reduce the achievable GMGR with respect to the perfect CSIT scenario. An interesting problem in this direction is to analyze the no CSIT GMGR of the channel for the general case and characterize the loss (in terms of multiplexing gain) due to lack of CSIT.
