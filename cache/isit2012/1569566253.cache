We show that adaptive testing does not help much, as the number of tests required obeys the same lower bound as nonadaptive testing. Our proof uses similar techniques to the proof that feedback does not improve channel capacity."},"body":{"text":"The problem of group testing concerns detecting the de- fective members of a set of items through the means of pooled tests. Group testing as a subject dates back to the work of Dorfman [1] in 1940s studying practical ways of testing soldiers\u2019 blood for syphilis, and has received much attention from combinatorialists and probabilists since.\nThe setup is as follows: Suppose we have a number of items, of which some are defective. To identify the defective items we could test each of the items individually for defectiveness. However, when the proportion of defective items is small, most of the tests will give negative results. A less wasteful method is to test pools of many items together at the same time. In the noise-free model, a pool gives a negative test outcome if it contains no defective items, and gives a positive outcome if it contains at least one defective item. (In Section II of this paper we consider models with noise.) After a number T of such pooled tests, it should be possible to deduce which items were defective.\nTraditionally, group testing has been seen as a combinatorial problem. One aims to ﬁnd a pooling strategy such that each possible defective set gives a different sequence of outcomes. This gives a zero error probability, and one is interested in how small T can be made. (See, for example, the textbook of Du and Hwang [2] for more details on the combinatorial approach to group testing.)\n\u2022 Nonadaptive group testing, where the entire pooling strategy is decided on beforehand;\n\u2022 Adaptive (or sequential) group testing, where the outcomes of previous tests can be used to inﬂuence the makeup of future pools.\nRecently, new results on nonadaptive group testing with arbitrarily small probability of error have been derived using information-theoretic techniques. A recent paper of Atia and Saligrama [3] proves bounds on T using techniques similar to the proof of Shannon\u2019s channel coding theorem [4].\nIn this paper, we study adaptive group testing using information-theoretic techniques. Clearly adaptive group test- ing cannot be more difﬁcult than nonadaptive testing. We show that it is not much easier either.\nSpeciﬁcally, Theorem 2 shows that the number of tests re- quired for adaptive group testing is no more than that required for nonadaptive testing, but is still greater than the Atia\u2013 Saligrama lower bound. The result is obtained by techniques similar to Shannon\u2019s proof that feedback does not improve capacity for channel coding [5]. As far as we are aware, this is the ﬁrst information-theoretic result for adaptive group testing.\nIn combinatorial zero-error group testing using the noise- free model, adaptive testing certainly is an improvement. Only O(K log N ) are needed for adaptive testing, whereas at least Ω(K 2 log N/ log K) are required for nonadaptive testing [2]. We note that this is similar to the case of zero-error channel coding, where feedback may improve the zero-error capacity [5].\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Section II we outline the information-theoretic approach to nonadaptive group testing, ﬁxing notation, and reviewing the work of Atia and Saligrama [3] and others. In Section III we brieﬂy review Shannon\u2019s result on channel coding with feedback, before stating and proving our main theorem (Theorem 2). We conclude with Section IV and discuss our results.\nFirst we ﬁx some notation. We have N items, of which a subset K of size K is defective. We wish to accurately estimate the defective set from T tests. A pooling strategy can be deﬁned by a testing matrix X = (x it ) ∈ {0, 1} N ×T , where x it = 1 denotes that item i is in the pool for test t, and x it = 0 denotes that it is not. Test t gives an output Y t in some output alphabet Y (which is usually {0, 1} also). Then, given\nthe test outcomes Y = (Y t ) ∈ Y T , we make an estimate ˆ K = ˆ K(Y) of the defective set. The average probability of error is .\nLet k t = |{i ∈ K : x it = 1}| denote the number of defective items in test t. In the main noise-free case, Y t = 0 (denoting a negative test outcome) if k t = 0, and Y t = 1 (denoting a positive test outcome) if k t ≥ 1.\nWe can also consider group testing with noise. Atia and Saligrama [3] consider two noise models:\n\u2022 Addition model, where false positives occur with prob- ability q. That is,\nif k t = 0, \t Y t = 0 with probability 1 − q, 1 with probability q;\n\u2022 Dilution model, where false negatives occur with prob- ability u k t . That is,\nSejdinovic and Johnson [6] considered a model where both the addition and the dilution errors can occur. Chan et al [11] consider another error model:\n\u2022 Symmetric error model, where false positives and false negatives both occur with the same probability q. That is,\nif k t = 0, \t Y t = 0 with probability 1 − q, 1 with probability q;\nAldridge [7, Chapter 6] considered a wider class of models where \u2018only defects matter\u2019, in that the distribution of Y t depends only on k t (and not on how many nondefective items are in a test pool). All the models above are examples of where only defects matter.\nWe will assume throughout that the group testing model is static and memoryless, in that the distribution of Y t given k t\nis the same for all t and, given k t , the distribution of Y t is independent of all past and future tests.\nGroup testing can be considered as being similar to channel coding. Here, the defective set takes the place of the message, the testing matrix is like the codeword (or perhaps the code- book), and the test outcomes are like the received signal. Then, like channel coding, we want to estimate the message/defective set using as few channel uses/tests as possible while keeping the error probability low. Figure 1 illustrates this.\nAtia and Saligrama\u2019s main result was the following bounds on the number of tests required to accurately detect the defective set [3].\nTheorem 1: Consider a group testing model where only defects matter. Let T ∗ NA = T ∗ NA (N, K, ) be the minimum number of tests necessary to identify K defects among N items with error probability at most ∈ (0, 1). Then for any p,\nHere, the X i are IID Bern(p), Y is related to X through the channel model, and I denotes mutual information. We have used the notation X L := (X i : i ∈ L) and similar.\nAtia and Saligrama [3] proved the theorem for the noise- free, addition and dilution models. Aldridge [7, Section 6.4] pointed out that their analysis extends to any model where only defects matter. Atia and Saligrama [3] also extended their result to the K = o(N ) asymptotic regime.\nThe proof of the upper bound is similar to Gallager\u2019s proof [8] of the direct part Shannon\u2019s channel coding theorem [4]. Test pools are designed at random, with X it = 1 with probability p and X it = 0 with probability 1 − p, IID over i and t. Estimation of the defective set is done on a maximum likelihood basis, in that ˆ K is chosen to maximise the probabilty of the outcome Y given the testing matrix X.\nThe proof of the lower bound resembles the converse part of Shannon\u2019s theorem (see for example [9, Section 7.9]), where Fano\u2019s inequality bounds the error probability. Unfortunately, unlike in Shannon\u2019s theorem, we are not so lucky that the upper and lower bounds asymptotically coincide, although they are close up to a logarithmic factor in N [3].\nThere has been other recent work on nonadaptive information-theoretic group testing. Sejdinovic and Johnson [6] gave accurate asymptotic expressions for T for the noise- free, addition and dilution models. Cheraghchi et al [10] considered group testing when the makeup of the pools is constrained by a graphical structure. Numerous authors [6], [12], [13], [11] have used modern decoding algorithms on nonadaptive group testing simulations.\nSome similar work has occured in the compressed sensing community; see the survey of Malyutov [14].\nIn adaptive group testing, the makeup of a testing pool can depend on the outcomes of earlier tests, so\nThis is similar to channel coding with feedback, where future inputs to the channel can depend on past outputs. Shannon proved that feedback does not improve the capacity of a single-user channel [5]. Since a transmitter could choose not to use the feedback, it\u2019s clear that the capacity with feedback is at least as high as the capacity without. However by being more careful with Fano\u2019s inequality in the proof of the converse, it can apply to the case of feedback also. See [9, Section 7.12], for example, for a detailed proof.\nOur result proceeds similarly. Due to the non-tightness of the bounds on testing in the nonadaptive case, we will not be able to show that adaptive group testing requires the same number of tests as nonadaptive testing, but we will be able to show that it obeys the same lower bound and requires no more tests than the nonadaptive case.\nThe lack of much improvement due to adaptive testing may initially seem surprising. However, the analogy with Shannon\u2019s feedback result explains why we should in fact expect this.\nWe emphasise that our theorem holds not only for the noise- free model, but also for the dilution and addition models, and any model where only defects matter.\nTheorem 2: Consider a group testing model where only defects matter. Let T ∗ NA and T ∗ A (dependent on N , K and ) be the minimum number of tests necessary to identify K defects among N items with error probability at most ∈ (0, 1) for nonadaptive and adaptive group testing respectively. Then, as N → ∞, for any p we have the inequalities\nProof: The third inequality is part of Theorem 1. The second inequality is trivial, as nonadaptive group testing is merely a special case of adaptive group testing where the tester chooses to ignore the information of previous test results.\nTo prove the ﬁrst inequality, we adapt Atia and Saligrama\u2019s proof of converse part of Theorem 1 [3], and Shannon\u2019s proof that feedback fails to improve channel capacity [5], as exposited by Cover and Thomas [9, Theorem 7.12.1].\nChoose a set of items L of size |L| uniformly at random from {1, 2, . . . , N }, and choose K of size K uniformly at random from sets containing L.\nSuppose a genie reveals to us the |L| defective items L ⊂ K, leaving us to work out the remaining K − |L| defective items. Given L, there are N −|L| K−|L| equally likely choices of the random K, so\nWe can now use Fano\u2019s inequality (see for example [9, Theorem 2.10.1]) to bound the conditional entropy term in (4) in terms of the error probability . Speciﬁcally, we have\nH(K | ˆ K, L) ≤ 1 + log N − |L| K − |L|\nsince there are again N −|L| K−|L| choices for K [3, Section IV]. Substituting (5) into (4) gives\nA series of standard information theory inequalities and identities show that the mutual information term in (6) can be bounded by\nWe relegate the elementary (but slightly long-winded) veriﬁ- cation of (7) to the Appendix.\nN − |L| K − |L|\n(8) Rearranging (8) to make the subject gives\nSince (10) has to be true for all L ⊂ K, and all test inclusion parameters p, this gives the result.\nWe have considered adaptive group testing for models where only defects matter with arbitrarily low probability of error. We have shown that adaptive testing requires no more tests than nonadaptive testing and, since it still obeys the Atia\u2013Saligrama lower bound, cannot reduce the number of tests very much.\nEven given the comparison of adaptive group testing with channel coding with feedback, our result may still seem sur- prising. We emphasise that the result is only for the N → ∞ asymptotic regime, where a vanishingly small proportion of items are defective. Also, our result is not about the zero- error = 0 case. With the noisy channel models, heuristics such as \u2018stop testing items that we are certain are defective\u2019 are irrelevant, as we can never be certain that an item is defective.\nIt remains an open question whether or not T ∗ A = T ∗ NA (either exactly or in an asymptotic sense), or whether, as with zero-error testing for the noise-free model, there is a gap between T A and T NA . Thus our result does not guarantee that adaptivity is of no gain, even in the asymptotic regime.\nEven if it were the case that T ∗ A = T ∗ NA , it still would not mean that the ability to construct tests adaptively is of no use in group testing with errors. For modest values of N , for example, adaptivity may reduce the number of tests necessary, with the beneﬁt vanishing as N → ∞. Also, adaptive testing may make optimal decoding algorithms simpler, or may make simple suboptimal decoding algorithms more effective.\nIn this appendix we verify the claim (7), that I(K; ˆ K | L) ≤ T I(X K\\L ; X L , Y ),\nWe use the data processing inequality left-hand side to write I(K; ˆ K | L) ≤ I(K; Y | L) = H(Y | L) − H(Y | K) (11)\nwhere the second equality in (11) is standard identity and we have used that L ∪ K = K.\nWe now unwrap the conditional entropy terms in (11) using the chain rule for entropy (see for example [9, Theorem 2.5.1]) and standard identities and inequalities. This gives\nwhere we have used the notation X Lt := (X it : i ∈ L) for ﬁxed t and similar. We justify the above steps as follows:\n(12) is from applying the chain rule to the right hand side of (11);\n(13) is because X Lt is a function of Y 1 , . . . , Y t−1 and L, and the same for K;\n(14) is because conditioning reduces entropy, so removing conditioning increases it;\n(15) is because, conditional on X Kt , we know Y t is inde- pendent of the previous outcomes Y 1 , . . . , Y t−1 and the defective set K.\nBut the term in the summand of (15) is precisely the mutual information\nSince the group testing model is static and memoryless, (16) is independent of t. Hence substituting (16) into (15) gives\nThe mutual information term in (17) can alternatively be written as\nsince, because we have chosen the X i independently, we know that X K\\L and X L are independent.\nThe author was supported by the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research and by the Engineering and Physi- cal Sciences Research Council, via the University of Bris- tol Bridging the Gaps cross-disciplinary feasibility account (EP/H024786/1).
