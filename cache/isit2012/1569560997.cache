The users observe correlated iid source sequences and then discuss in public until a subset of them, called the active users, can agree on a nearly uniformly random secret key that is asymptotically secure from the wiretapper who listens to the entire public discussion. The maximum achievable rate, called the secrecy capacity, was characterized in [ 2 ]. It was shown to be strongly achievable in the sense that the amount of leaked information not only decays to zero but at an exponential rate in the block length. However, the precise exponent, called the secrecy exponent, was not characterized. Its positivity was shown only by averaging over all possible choices of key functions at rate below the capacity. This random coding argument gives little insight as to how the key should be chosen in practice and how small the coding complexity can be. Although it was shown later in [ 3 ] that the secret key can be restricted to be purely a function of the source sequence observed by any one active user, the capacity was shown to be achievable only weakly, i.e. the amount of leaked information may decay to zero subexponentially. It was not clear whether the restriction on the key function comes at the cost of strong security.\nThe purpose of this work is to characterize an achievable secrecy exponent and explore the admissible choices of key functions that can achieve the capacity strongly. In doing so, we formulate a more general secret key agreement problem in § II where the key is chosen from a restricted class of functions, e.g. a set of linear functions on a component source. The secrecy exponent is derived in § IV using the privacy ampliﬁcation theorem from [ 4 , 5 ] introduced in § III .\nLet V be the ﬁnite set of users and Z V := (Z i : i ∈ V ) be a ﬁnitely-valued distributed random source with a given joint distribution P Z V . Each user i ∈ V observes an iid sequence of the component source Z i . A non-empty subset A ⊆ V : A ̸= ∅\nof active users want to share a secret key as a function of the source sequences. It should be asymptotically uniformly random to a wiretapper who wiretaps the observations of a subset D ⊆ A c := V \\ A of untrusted users. The users in V \\(A∪D) are trusted helpers, who need not share the key and whose observations are not revealed directly to the wiretapper. The users are allowed to discussion in public as in [ 2 ] but the entire discussion is revealed to the wiretapper. Unlike [ 2 ], however, we consider a more general model where the key is restricted to be a function of the iid sequence of a secret source G that is a deterministic function of Z V characterized by some conditional distribution P G |Z V . The original model in [ 2 ] is the unrestricted case G = Z V when |A| ≥ 2. The secret source may correspond to some sensitive information that needs to be protected as much as possible as in [ 6 , 7 ]. However, the objective here is not to recover the secret source securely but to extract a key from it. The secret source acts as an artiﬁcial parameter that conﬁnes the choices of the secret key to a smaller set.\nA simpliﬁed secret key agreement protocol is as follows. Each user i ∈ V observes an n-sequence Z n i := (Z it : t ∈ [n]) of his private source, where [n] := {1, . . . , n} for any positive integer block length n ∈ P. They broadcast F := (F i : i ∈ V ) in public over an authenticated noiseless channel where F i is the message from user i ∈ V as a function of Z n i at rate\nwith r V := (r i : i ∈ V ) denoting the set of public discussion rates and r(V ) :=\nEach active user i ∈ A generates an estimate K i of a secret key K, where K must be a function of G n and K i must be a function of (Z n i , F). The key rate is\nwhere K is the support set of the secret key and the key estimates. The probability of error for user i ∈ A is\nwhere D and H are the divergence and entropy respectively [ 8 ] with all logarithms taken with respect to the natural number e. If the public messages, secret key and key estimates is chosen such that ε i n and ς n goes to zero, then (R, r V ) is said to be\nachievable and the maximum achievable key rate is called the secrecy capacity. The secrecy index approaching zero, in particular, means that the key becomes uniformly distributed independent of the wiretapper\u2019s observations. The convergence rates are captured by the error and secrecy exponents\n1 n\n(R, r V , E A , S) is said to be strongly achievable if the expo- nents are strictly positive. The secrecy capacity is strongly achievable if all key rates below the capacity can be achieved with positive exponents and non-negative discussion rates. The secrecy capacity when G = Z V is referred to as the unrestricted secrecy capacity. Any G that maximizes the capacity to that of the unrestricted case is called admissible.\nThe main ingredient for computing the achievable expo- nents is the privacy ampliﬁcation theorem from [ 4 ]. We will introduce it using some simpliﬁed models.\nA user observing X wants to extract a key K as a function of X as securely as possible against a wiretapper observing W. The level of secrecy is measured by the index\nwhich is zero iff K is uniformly distributed independent of W. The objective is to characterize the optimal tradeoff between the secrecy index ς and key size |K|.\ne.g. we have ς = 0 for |K| = 1 by choosing K = 0 determinis- tically. For the non-trivial case |K| > 0, an achievable tradeoff can be obtained using the random code from [ 4 ] below.\nLet {θ l : l ∈ L} be a universal family of functions θ l : X → K indexed by the ﬁnite set L, i.e. for all x ̸= ˜x ∈ X,\nwhere the random index L is uniformly distributed over L, independent of (X, W) and known to everyone. The key function is chosen randomly from this family, i.e. K := θ L (X). n.b. θ l \u2019s can be linear over some ﬁnite ﬁeld as shown in [ 5 ].\nwhere the expectation over L is pushed inside the logarithm by Jensen\u2019s inequality. n.b. for (x, w, l) ∈ X × W × L,\nas K = θ L (X). Averaging over l ∈ L, the last summation over ˜ x equals\n|L| . Applying ( 8 ), E\nThis bound was ﬁrst obtained in [ 4 ] and related to R´enyi entropy of order 2 by applying the inequality ln(1 + δ) ≤ δ for δ ≥ 0. It was improved later in [ 5 ] using R´enyi entropy of other order 1 + s ∈ (1, 2] using the inequality ln(1 + δ) ≤ δ s s\nfor δ ≥ 0 and s ∈ (0, 1]. The improvement is obtained, in particular, by tightening the bound on ln(1 + δ) with s ↓ 0 instead of s = 1 when δ becomes large. In essence of this, we will use the following more direct inequality without the additional optimization over the parameter s.\nwhich is simply ln(1 + δ) ≤ δ for δ ∈ [0, 1] and ln(1 + δ) ≤ max {1, ln(1 + δ)} otherwise. We can apply this inequality to ( 11 ) with δ = ( |K| − 1)P X |W (X |W), in which case\nmin {1, δ} ≤ min{1, |K|P X |W (X |W)} max {1, ln(1 + δ)} ≤ max{1, ln|K|} ≤ ln|K|\nwhere the last inequality is because P X |W (X |W) ≤ 1 and |K| ≥ 3 > e. This gives ( 9 ) as desired. \t ■\nThe user observes an i.i.d. sequence Z n and the wiretapper observes (Y n , F) where Y n is another i.i.d. sequence cor- related with Z n according to P n YZ and F := θ(Y n , Z n ) is an arbitrary function taking values over a ﬁnite set F that grows at rate r := lim sup n →∞ 1 n ln |F |. The objective is to characterize the optimal tradeoff between the key rate R := lim inf n →∞ 1 n ln |K| and secrecy exponent\nn.b. S is the exponent of ς in ( 7 ) with X and W replaced by Z n and (Y n , F) respectively. A lower bound on the largest achievable S can therefore be computed from ( 9 ) as follows.\n− 1 n ln E [ min { 1, |K|P Z n |FY n (Z n |F, Y n ) }] ≥ min\ncan be achieved by universal hashing, where P(Y Z) is the simplex of distributions on Y × Z, and |x| + := max {0, x}. 2\nP ROOF The ﬁrst inequality is by ( 9 ) and the fact that ln |K| is linear in n and therefore does not contribute to the exponent. We will evaluate the exponent using the method of types [ 8 ] for the special case Y is deterministic. The general case follows easily by an additional conditioning on Y.\nRecall that the type of z ∈ Z n is the empirical distribution, say Q, where nQ(α) is the number of α ∈ Z appearing in z. Denote the set of possible types by P n (Z) and the set of all z ∈ Z n of the same type Q ∈ P n (Z) by the type class T n Q . The main results we need from the method of types are\nP n Z (z) = e −n[D(Q∥P Z )+H(Q)] \t ∀z ∈ T n Q , \t (14) |P n (Z) | . = 1, |T n Q | . = e nH(Q) and P n Z (T n Q ) . = e −nD(Q∥P Z )\nwhere a n . ⩽ b n (a n . = b n ) denotes inequality (equality) in the exponents that lim sup n →∞ 1 n ln a n b\nwhere the inequality is by F = θ(Z) and the last equality is by ( 14 ). Thus, E\n| . Then (α j : j ∈ F ) is a distribution on F because T n Q is partitioned by the disjoint sets S Q (j) for j ∈ F . With x j := |K| |S\n| , the above summation over j ∈ F can be rewritten as |T n Q |\nα j min {1, x j }. Since min{1, x} is concave in x, the summation can be upper bounded by Jensen\u2019s inequality by min\n} . With |T n Q | . = e nH(Q) , |F | . ⩽ e nr and |K| . ⩽ e nR , we have\nConsider the vector model but with K restricted to be a function of G n distributed as P n G |Z given Z n . In addition,\nAs before, we apply the universal hashing K := θ L (G) where {θ l : l ∈ L} is a universal family of functions θ l : G → K, and L is a uniformly random index independent of (Z n , Y n , F). Although the secrecy exponent can be lower bounded by ( 13 ) with Z replaced by G, a tighter bound may be obtained using the error exponent ξ as follows.\nLemma 3 For the vector model with restricted key, universal hashing achieves a secrecy exponent ( 12 ) at least the minimum of ξ in ( 15 ) and the R.H.S. of ( 13 ). \t 2\nn.b. if ξ is very large, the exponent would be given by ( 13 ) without replacing Z by G. This is potentially larger than the bound with Z replaced by G since the randomness of G can be smaller than that of Z.\nP ROOF Let B be the indicator of the event Z n ̸= ϕ(G n , Y n , F) and W := (Y n , F). The average secrecy index ς in ( 7 ) is ln |K| − H(K|WL) ≤ ln|K| − H(K|BWL)\nby E [(1 − B) ln|K|] = P B (0) ln |K| and Jensen\u2019s inequality as in the Proof of Lemma 1 . Similar to ( 11 ), by ( 8 )\nThe expression in the last expectation can be bounded as B ln\nTo explain this, consider the non-trivial case when B = 1. Then, Z n = ϕ(G n , Y n , F) and so there is a bijection be- tween Z n and G n given W, implying P G n |BW (G n |1, W) = P Z n |BW (Z n |1, W) as desired. The R.H.S. can be upper bounded further by min\n} ln |K| for |K| ≥ 3 as in the proof of Lemma 1 . Hence,\nThe exponents of P B (0) and the expectation are ξ and the R.H.S. of ( 13 ) respectively, the minimum of which gives the overall exponent of the bound as desired. \t ■\nWe now derive an inner bound to the achievable rates and exponents of the secret key agreement problem in § II by the universal hashing and privacy ampliﬁcation theorem in § III .\nAs in ( 8 ), the secret key K is chosen as K := θ L (G n ) where L is an independent random index uniformly distributed over the ﬁnite set L and {θ : l ∈ L} is a universal family of functions θ l : G n → K satisfying Pr{θ L (g) = θ L (˜ g) } ≤ 1 |K| for all g ̸= ˜g ∈ G n . For i ∈ V , the public message F i by user i is chosen as F i := θ i L\n(Z n i ) where L i is an independent uniformly random index and {θ i l\n: l ∈ L i } is a universal family of functions θ i l\nAs in [ 2 ], we require all the active users to learn the en- tire source after public discussion, which is referred to as communication for omniscience. Each user i ∈ A generates an estimate ˆ Z i of Z n V as a function of his accumulated observations (L V , Z n i , F). If the estimates are correct, then they can compute the secret key correctly since it is a function of G n , which in turn, is determined by Z n V . The probability of error ( 3 ) is therefore upper bounded by the probability of error in recovering Z n V . By the source coding results [ 9 ], the error exponent can be no smaller than the random coding exponent\nwhere H(Q Z B |Z Bc |Q Z Bc ) is the conditional entropy of Z B given Z B c when Z V has the joint distribution Q Z V . Since D(Q Z V ∥P Z V ) ≥ 0 with equality iff Q Z V = P Z V , the exponents for all i ∈ A are positive if Υ P ZV (B) ≥ 0, i.e.\nTo lower bound the secrecy exponent, we will introduce a virtual user and a virtual message to the system. They are not part of the actual system, however, and are introduced only for the purpose of computing the bound. After the entire public message F is revealed, one of the active users, say j ∈ A, generates a virtual message U = θ \u2032 L \u2032 (Z n j ) at rate u = lim sup n →∞ 1 n |U| where {θ \u2032 l \u2032 : l \u2032 ∈ L \u2032 } is a universal family and L \u2032 is an independent uniformly random index. Let\nA virtual user observes (F \u2032 , Z n D , G n ) and generates an estimate ˆ Z \u2032 of the entire source Z n\nwhere Q GZ V is a distribution on G × Z V . Once again, the exponent is positive if Υ \u2032 P GZV (B) ≥ 0 for all B ⊆ D c , which, in turn, holds if u + r(B) > H(Z B |Z B c G). The cases where B ̸⊇ A are implied by ( 18 ) and u ≥ 0 since H(Z B |Z B c ) ≥ H(Z B |Z B c G). Thus, the exponent is positive if (u, r V ) satisﬁes ( 18 ) and the additional constraints that\nInstead of having (L V , L \u2032 ) uniformly random, ﬁx it to some good realization (l V , l \u2032 ) that achieves the error exponents in ( 16 ) and ( 20 ). Denote by ˆ Z \u2032 := ϕ(G n , Z n D , F \u2032 ) the source\nestimate of the virtual user, which can simply be the min- entropy decoder [ 9 ]. We can apply Lemma 3 with Z = Z V , Y = Z D and F replaced by F \u2032 . The error exponent ξ in ( 15 ) is E \u2032 (u, r V ) in ( 20 ), and the R.H.S. of ( 13 ) corresponds to\nwhich is positive if ( 22 ) and ( 24 ) are satisﬁed. In summary, we have the following achievable rate and exponents.\nTheorem 1 (R, r V , E A , S) is strongly achievable if R ≥ 0, 0 < E i ≤ E i (r V ) in ( 16 ) for all i ∈ A and 0 < S ≤ S(u, r V , R) in ( 25 ) for some u ≥ 0. \t 2\nCorollary 1 (R, r V ) is strongly achievable if R ≥ 0, ( 18 ), ( 22 ) and ( 24 ) are satisﬁed for some u ≥ 0. It follows that if\nr \u2032 (B) ≥ H(Z B |Z B c ) \t ∀B ⊆ D c : B ̸⊇ A r \u2032 (B) ≥ H(Z B |Z B c G) ∀B ⊆ D c : B ⊇ A\n(26b) (26c)\nP ROOF (R, r V ) is strongly achievable because ( 18 ), ( 22 ) and ( 24 ) for some u ≥ 0 implies that the exponents are positive as argued before. Consider proving the second implication in the corollary. Suppose r \u2032 D c is an optimal solution to ( 26 ). For δ > 0 sufﬁciently small, we have ( 26a ) even if r \u2032 i \u2019s are increased by δ. Let u := 0, r i := r \u2032 i + δ for i ∈ D c and r i arbitrarily large for i ∈ D. Then, ( 26b ), ( 26c ) and ( 26a ) imply ( 18 ), ( 22 ) and ( 24 ) respectively. Hence, R is strongly achievable. \t ■\n( 26 ) can be explained intuitively as follows. r \u2032 D c can be interpreted as a discussion rate tuple that satisﬁes the Slepian- Wolf constraints [ 8 ] ( 26b ) and ( 26c ) for the active users j ∈ A and the virtual user observing G to attain omniscience of Z V . H(Z D c |Z D ) is the common randomness among the active users not revealed through Z D while at most r \u2032 (D c ) of it is revealed through the public discussion. The remaining common randomness, i.e. the R.H.S. of in ( 26a ), remains secret. In particular, the portion of secret randomness in G can be used for the key. Since the virtual user can recover Z D c from G, all the randomness in Z D c is in G. Indeed, the entire secret randomness is the secrecy capacity.\nTheorem 2 The R.H.S. of ( 26a ) is the secrecy capacity and so any rate below the capacity is strongly achievable. \t 2\nThe capacity is a linear program that can be computed in polynomial time with respect to |V | as shown in [ 10 ]. The capacity in [ 2 ] is the special case when G = Z V and the necessary condition for secure computing in [ 6 ] can also be expressed in terms of this capacity [ 7 ].\n(27b) where r \u2032 U ≥ 0 means that r \u2032 i ≥ 0 for all i ∈ U. C s (U ) can be interpreted as the unrestricted capacity when U c ⊇ D is the set of untrusted users. In particular, to see that C s (D c ) is the unrestricted capacity ( 26a ) when G = Z V , n.b. ( 26c ) becomes r \u2032 (B) ≥ 0 for B ⊆ D c : B ⊇ A. This holds iff r \u2032 (A) ≥ 0 and r \u2032 i ≥ 0 for all i ∈ D c \\ A. We have r \u2032 U ≥ 0 altogether since r \u2032 i ≥ 0 for i ∈ A follows from r \u2032 (A) ≥ 0 when |A| = 1 and from ( 26b ) when |A| ≥ 2. The following theorem gives a sufﬁcient condition for G to be admissible in terms on C s (U ).\ni.e. the secrecy capacity ( 26a ) equals C s (D c ) in ( 27a ). \t 2 P ROOF The secrecy capacity ( 26a ) is no larger than C s (D c ) trivially because ( 26b ) is identical to ( 27b ) for U = D c . Consider proving the reverse inequality. Suppose r \u2032 D c is an optimal solution to ( 27a ) with U = D c , attaining the secrecy capacity C s (D c ). We will show that ( 26c ) holds under ( 28 ) and so r \u2032 D c is feasible to ( 26a ) as desired. Since ( 27b ) for U = D c , i.e. ( 26b ), implies ( 27b ) for any U ⊆ D c : U ⊇ A, r \u2032 U is a feasible solution to ( 27a ), i.e. C s (U ) ≥ H(Z U |Z U c ) − r \u2032 (U ), which implies by ( 28 ) that H(G |Z U c ) ≥ H(Z U |Z U c ) − r \u2032 (U ) and therefore ( 26c ) with U rewritten as B. \t ■\nIn words, G is admissible if its randomness remains no smaller than the unrestricted capacity when some trusted helpers in V \\ (A ∪ D) becomes untrusted. When all users are active, i.e. A = D c = V , ( 28 ) simpliﬁes to H(G) ≥ C s (V ), which is indeed the counterpart of the sufﬁcient condition H(G) < C s (V ) for G to be securely computable in [ 6 ].\nfor some j ∈ A with |A| ≥ 2. \t 2 P ROOF Consider proving that ( 28 ) is satisﬁed by |A| ≥ 2 and ( 29 ) for some j ∈ A. For any U ⊆ D c : U ⊇ A, let r \u2032 U be the optimal solution that attains the capacity C s (U ) in ( 27a ). Since |A| ≥ 2, we have {j} ̸⊇ A and so r \u2032 j ≥ H(Z j |Z V \\{j} ) ≥ H(Z j |G) by ( 27b ) and ( 29 ). Similarly, since |U \\ {j}| ̸⊇ A, we also have r \u2032 (U \\ {j}) ≥ H(Z U \\{j} |Z U c ) by ( 27b ) and the fact that j ∈ A ⊆ U. Thus,\nwhich is at least H(Z U |Z U c G). Applying this to the fact that C s (U ) ≤ H(Z U |Z U c ) − r \u2032 (U ) gives ( 28 ) as desired. \t ■\nThe admissible restriction in [ 3 ] is the special case when G = Z j for some j ∈ A, in which case ( 29 ) follows from H(G) = H(Z j ) ≥ I(Z j ∧ Z V \\{j} ). ( 29 ) extends it further to functions of Z j with sufﬁciently large randomness.\nWe have formulated the problem of secret key agreement with a restricted key and derived an inner bound to the error and secrecy exponents by the random coding error exponent and the privacy ampliﬁcation theorem for universal hashing. The secrecy capacity is in the form of a polynomial-time solvable linear program strongly achievable with the key and public discussion functions restricted to be linear over a ﬁnite ﬁeld. A restriction on the key is also shown to be admissible if its randomness remains no smaller than the unrestricted secrecy capacities when some helpers become untrusted. This leads to a larger class of admissible restrictions than previously known without sacriﬁcing strong security.\nIt is possible improve the secrecy exponent as shown in [ 1 ]. e.g. the exponent S \u2032 (0, r V , R) in ( 23 ) larger than the one in ( 25 ) is achievable for the unrestricted case G = Z V because the virtual user can recover Z n V perfectly from G n without any virtual message, i.e. u = 0. For the more general case, it is also possible to improve the exponent by the multiterminal privacy ampliﬁcation theorem in [ 7 ] that exploits the additional fact that the discussion functions are not arbitrary given functions of certain rates but can be chosen optimally from some universal families. In particular, the improvement is a consequence of securing the type information of Z n V from the public messages. It would be interesting to see how much improvement is possible by giving an outer bound on the achievable rates and exponents."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
