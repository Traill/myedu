This is mainly due to Shannon\u2019s original result [1] which shows that feedback provides no increase in capacity for discrete memoryless point- to-point channels. Although feedback can indeed increase the capacity of multiple access channels [2], the increase in capacity for the Gaussian case is bounded by 1 bit for all channel parameters [3].\nContrary to the traditional belief on feedback capacity, recent results show that feedback is of fundamental importance when communicating over interference channels (ICs) [4], [5], [6]. Speciﬁcally, this feedback gain is shown to be unbounded, i.e., the gain can be arbitrarily large for certain channel parameters. The promising gain due to feedback is further investigated for more realistic scenarios where feedback cost is taken into consideration [7], [8]. Vahid et al. in [7] take a separation approach which models feedback links (backward channels) as rate-constrained bit pipes, and demonstrate that under this model, one bit of feedback provides one bit of capacity increase. In [8] a new strategy is developed that feeds back through a corresponding backward channel without the bit-pipe abstraction, and shows that this scheme can outperform the separation approach. As a consequence, it is shown that feedback can provide a net increase in capacity\neven if feedback cost is taken into consideration. A logical next step is to explore the promising role of feedback in broader contexts.\nIn this work, we consider the K-user Gaussian IC with feedback, where channel coefﬁcients are constant over time and frequency. We focus on two feedback models: (1) the received signals of all the receivers are fed back to all of the transmitters; (2) functions of the received signals are fed back through a backward Gaussian IC. For all cases that we consider, we assume the transmitter-receiver links to be full- duplex, i.e., a transceiving user can receive and transmit at the same time. For the ﬁrst idealistic and not so practical model, we develop a linear achievable scheme and derive a new upper bound to show that the fdof is K 2 for all channel realizations that ensure the invertibility of the global channel matrix.\nFor the second, more realistic, model, we make progress on the 3-user IC. We develop a feedback strategy that builds on the interference alignment-and-cancellation idea, and achieves dof = 3 2 , almost surely for randomly-drawn channels. For the 4-user case, we develop a heuristic algorithm that ﬁnds feed- back coding coefﬁcients; we observe through simulations that this algorithm ensures the achievability of 4 2 for a multitude of experiments. For an arbitrary K number of users, we identify a class of channels with speciﬁc spectral properties, where nontrivial fdof is achievable with a very simple feedback strategy.\nOur results indicate that i) feedback can be used to achieve the degrees-of-freedom (dof) of an IC in a ﬁnite number of signaling dimensions and ii) feedback can increase the dof for some classes of scalar ICs where the non-feedback dof is either not achievable using linear schemes or is stricly less than K 2 .\nRelated Work: Nonfeedback strategies for the K-user Gaussian IC were studied previously [9], [10], [11], [12]. In their breakthrough paper, Cadambe and Jafar [9] showed that interference alignment (IA) [13], can achieve dof = K 2 for vector ICs with arbitrarily large channel diversity, e.g., i.i.d time-varying channels. This result is tight even if feedback or relays are used, i.e., the use of relays or feedback does not provide a DoF gain under the i.i.d. time varying channels assumption [14]. For the scalar channel case, Motahari et al. [11] developed a nonlinear IA technique to show that interestingly dof is K 2 with probability 1, for randomly-drawn channel coefﬁcients. Etkin and Ordentlich [10] showed that dof is strictly less that K 2 for some class of scalar ICs. In [12],\nYetis et al. showed that under linear transceiver assumption, dof = 1 for scalar ICs. On the other hand, we show that feedback enables dof = K 2 only with linear strategies that rely on a ﬁnite number of signal-space dimensions.\nFeedback strategies were studied by Kramer [4], [5] and Tandon et al. [15] and Mohaher et al. [16], assuming that feedback is available from each receiver to its correspond- ing transmitter. While all of these techniques result in a signiﬁcant capacity increase for a multitude of interesting channel regimes, these achieve dof = 1, thereby showing the suboptimality of the schemes in general. On the other hand, we consider different feedback conﬁgurations to develop coding techniques that achieve the optimal dof.\nWe assume two feedback models in this work and describe them in the following.\nFeedback Model I: In Fig. 1, we provide a sketch of the scalar K-user Gaussian IC with perfect feedback. The received signal of receiver k at time n is\nwhere X m [n] indicates the encoded signal of transmitter m, h km is the \u201cchannel processing\u201d coefﬁcient from transmitter m to receiver k, and Z k [n] denotes zero-mean additive white Gaussian noise at receiver k with normalized power, i.e., Z k ∼ CN (0, 1). We assume an average power constraint on all transmitted signals E{X m [n]} = P . We note that the channel coefﬁcients are assumed ﬁxed over time.\nThe transmitters generate K independent and uniformly distributed messages, W k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , M k } , ∀k ∈ [K], where [N ] denotes the set {1, · · · , N }. The encoded signal X k [n] of transmitter k at time n is a function of its own message and past output sequences of all receivers\nwhere Y n−1 k = (Y k [1], · · · , Y k [n−1]) denotes the sequence of received symbols at receiver k up to time index n − 1. A rate\ntuple (R 1 , · · · , R K ) is said to be achievable if there exists a family of codewords, subject to the power constraint, and encoding/decoding functions such that the average decoding error probabilities go to zero as the code length N tends to inﬁnity. The capacity region C is the closure of the set of all achievable rate pairs. We deﬁne the degrees-of-freedom (dof)\nFeedback Model II: We consider another feedback model of practical interest where feedback is offered by the backward IC. The fed back signal received at transmitter m at time n is\nwhere ˜ X k [n] indicates the encoded signal of receiver k, ˜ h mk indicates the backward channel coefﬁcient from receiver k to transmitter m, and ˜ Z m [n] denotes the additive white Gaussian noise observed by transmitter m with normalized power such that ˜ Z m ∼ CN (0, 1). Again, we assume that the average transmit power of each receiver is limited by P and that channel coefﬁcients are ﬁxed over time. In this model, the encoded signal X k [n] of transmitter k at time slot n is a function of the message and feedback signals\nIn the following we summarize the main results of our work. Theorem 1 (Model I): Let H be a global channel matrix,\ni.e., [H] mk = h mk and rank(H) = K. Then, the feedback degrees-of-freedom (fdof) of the scalar K-user IC under model I is\nTheorem 2 (Model II): Let each h mk be randomly drawn from a continuous distribution and i.i.d over m and k. More- over, let the ˜ h mk random coefﬁcients be either correlated with or drawn independently to ˜ h km . Then the fdof of the scalar 3-user IC under model 2 is\nProof: The converse proof follows from that of Theo- rem 1. See Section V for the achievability.\nTheorem 3 (Model II): Let H be a full-rank symmetric channel matrix with L distinct eigenvalues. Then,\nRemark 1 (Linear dof): Assuming linear transceivers, the non-feedback dof is 1 for the scalar IC [12]. On the other\nhand, our feedback strategy is linear and thus shows dof gain for arbitrary scalar ICs.\nRemark 2 (Finite Symbol Extensions): In sharp contrast to the symbol extended IA schemes and inﬁnite precision real IA schemes of [9] and [11], when feedback is used, then the full dof of a channel can be achieved in a ﬁxed number of symbol extensions.\nRemark 3 (Comparison to the non-feedback dof): As an example, we present a channel matrix where the non-feedback dof is provably 1 and feedback can provide gain. Note that H = [1 − 1 − 1; −1 1 − 1; −1 − 1 1] is invertible and hence fdof = 3 2 , which improves upon the non-feedback dof = 1. For a proof see the full version of the paper [17].\nOur achievable scheme operates on 4 time slots. In time- slot 1, each transmitter sends its own symbol and the channel output is given by\nwhere y[1] \t = [Y 1 [1], · · · , Y K [1]] T and x[1] = [X 1 [1], · · · , X K [1]] T . We ignore the noise, since we are interested in dof. Under this model, feedback is available from every receiver to every transmitter and allows each transmitter to obtain y[1] at time 2. Meanwhile each transmitter sends another new symbol.\nThe invertibility assumption on H enables each transmitter to compute H −1 y[1] = x[1] and therefore decode all of the other users\u2019 symbols. This observation naturally motivates us to employ a zero-forcing precoder in the next stage. Notice that the channel is now a virtual MIMO broadcast channel. Hence, transmitter k computes the vector H −1 x[1] and sends its kth component.\nMeanwhile, the previously-received signals (at time 2) are fed back to all of the transmitters. Again each transmitter computes H −1 x[2] and then sends its corresponding component. In time- slot 4, the received signal is y[4] = H(H −1 x[2]) = x[2]. Hence, during 4 time-slots, 2K symbols are transmitted. Therefore, fdof = K 2 .\nRemark 4: Observe that our scheme does not require chan- nel diversity. However, it does not either require that the channels are static, i.e., if H varied across time-slots, then\nOur converse is based on the following lemma that bounds the rate for any couple of users i, j ∈ [K].\nwhere S = [K]\\{i, j}, Y S = {Y k }, k ∈ S, and V ij = h ij X j + Z i .\nProof: Ommited due to lack of space. See the full version of the paper [17].\nwhere i, j ∈ [K], with i = j, and K G X indicates the covariance matrix of a Gaussian random vector X. Straightforward com- putation with Lemma 1 gives R i + R j ≤ log P + o(log P ), where lim P →∞ o(log P ) log P = 0. Therefore, we get\nRemark 5: Alternatively, we can use Theorem 1 in [14] to prove dof ≤ K 2 . We instead derive a new outer bound of Lemma 1 to prove the converse. Note that Lemma 1 is not limited to the degrees-of-freedom.\nWe will show that 6 symbols can be transmitted during 4 time slots. During time slot 1 and 2 the transmitters send the symbol vectors x[1], x[2]; the received signal at receiver k ∈ [3] and time slot n ∈ [2] is\nIn time-slot 2, while the transmitters send the second batch of symbols, each receiver feeds back an appropriately scaled version of the previous channel output e.g., Y k [1]. The fed back signal received at transmitter k is\nwhere for simplicity we assume that ˜ h km = h mk , however, the following derivations can be carried out to the case, where the backward channel coefﬁcients are independent to the forward ones. We design the coding coefﬁcients b and c so that the X 2 [1] component of the signal is cancelled out at transmitters 1 and 3. That way, transmitter 1 can decode transmitter 3\u2019s symbol and vice versa. Expanding (10), we get\nWe ﬁrst select coefﬁcients b and c such that the underlined terms are canceled out at transmitters 1 and 3\nTransmitters 1 and 3 will receive as feedback a nonzero linear combination of X 1 [1] and X 3 [1], almost surely, when assuming channels drawn at random and i.i.d. from continuous distributions that do not have mass around zero. Then, assum- ing that transmitters 1 and 3 have perfect knowledge of the\nchannel and the constants b and c, they can each decode the other user\u2019s symbols by simply subtracting a scaled version of X 1 [1] and X 3 [1] from their received equations. This extra knowledge is key to establishing alignment of interfering terms using an extra round of transmissions.\nAt time 3, transmitter 2 re-sends X 2 [1], while transmit- ter 1 sends α 1 X 1 [1] + α 3 X 3 [1] and transmitter 3 sends γ 1 X 1 [1] + γ 3 X 3 [1]. These linear combinations are designed such that the resulting interference terms of Y k [3] align with the ones of Y k [1], while enforcing the useful symbols to be distinguishable. This way, each receiver will be able to decode the symbol of interest. The received signal at receiver 1 is\nand interference alignment can be achieved for α 3 and γ 3 satisfying h 11 α 3 + h 13 γ 3 = h 13 . At receiver 2 we have\nThe interference alignment condition for this receiver is h 21 α 1 + h 23 γ 1 = −h 21 and h 23 γ 3 + h 21 α 3 = −h 23 . Ac- cordingly, at receiver 3, we have\nand its alignment condition is h 31 α 1 + h 33 γ 1 = h 31 . Solving the 4 equations in the 4 unknowns α 1 , α 3 , γ 1 , γ 3 yields\nThe decoupling of the equations is possible due to the fact that user\u2019s 2 symbols where canceled out in the feedback phase. We now continue by rewriting the received signals as\nUsing the two rounds of received signals at slots 1 and 3, each receiver can now solve for its symbol of interest\nThe decodability requires A − h 11 = 0, 2h 22 = 0, and C − h 33 = 0, where each of the conditions can be restated as a\nnonzero polynomial in the channel coefﬁcients. Then, we use the following Lemma.\nLemma 2: Let n independent random variables X 1 , X 2 , . . . , .X n that are drawn from continuous distributions over R with density functions that do not have discontinuities around 0. Then, if P (X 1 , . . . , X n ) is a non-identically zero polynomial of degree d we have that Pr {P (X 1 , . . . , X n ) = 0} = 0.\nProof: Ommited due to lack of space. See the full version of the paper [17].\nDue to Lemma 2, these polynomials are nonzero almost surely for channel elements drawn at random and i.i.d. from continuous distributions, therefore the conditions hold almost surely.\nDuring time slot 3 the receivers send the corresponding feedback that allows, the decoding of the second batch of symbols x[2] in time-slot 4. Again this batch of symbols will be decodable almost surely. Hence, fdof = 3 2 is achievable almost surely. This completes the proof.\nRemark 6: We would like to note that the above achievabil- ity scheme works even if the channel coefﬁcients are varying across time-slots.\nWe continue our study on the K > 3 case, for which we develop a heuristic algorithm that ﬁnds coding coefﬁcients for the feedback strategy. Similar to the 3-user case, we consider a 4 time transmission scheme, where at each round we assume that the transmitting end can combine and scale all the information that it has available. Let at the ﬁrst round that the transmitters send the K-length vector x[1]. Then, the received signal at time slot 1 is y[1] = Hx[1]. The receivers rescale the channel output and feed it back to the transmitter, which receives ˆ y[2] = H T D 1 Hx[1], where D 1 indicates a K × K diagonal matrix. At timeslot 3, the transmitters combine x[1] with ˆ y[2] and x[2], and the received vector is y[3] = HD 2 H T D 1 Hx[1]+HD 3 x[1], where D i , i ∈ {1, 2, 3} are all K × K diagonal matrices. Hence, a sufﬁcient condition for decodability of the ﬁrst batch of symbols is\nfor some selection of diagonal combining matrices. We can rewrite (14) as a set of K 2 equations in the unknown diagonals\nIt is not hard to show that the total number of free variables in the above multilinear system of equations is equal to 5K − 2. We expect that this system should be feasible when the number of unknowns is at most equal to the number of equations, which is true for K ≤ 4. For the K = 3 case, we obtained a closed form solution solving linear equations. However, for the K = 4 case, solving for the unknown diagonals requires solving intricate multilinear equations, which we cannot do efﬁciently.\nTo tackle this intrinsic nonlinearity of ﬁnding fdof achieving diagonals, we ﬁrst reformulate the problem as a nonconvex optimization, which we subsequently relax to a convex one. Ideally, we would like to solve the the following optimization\nwhere the rank constraint enforces that all K symbols are distinguishable (i.e. nonzero) at the receivers. Due to the rank constraints and the nonconvex cost function the above optimization does not seem tractable. To solve it, we relax it to an alternating convex optimization problem, where we replace the nonconvex rank constraints with afﬁne ones. Let g ({D i }) = D 4 H + HD 2 H T D 1 H + HD 3 − D 5 F , where\nA F indicates the Frobenius norm of matrix A. Then, we use the following (randomized) heuristic.\nWe simulate the above heuristic for the 4-user case. We set = 10 −7 , N = 10 4 , N 1 = 30, 1 = 0.1, N 2 = 200 and 2 = 10 −4 . We generate 100 channel realizations. We assume that channel coefﬁcients are ﬁxed and drawn i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian with variance 1. All simulation results show that the heuristic convergence to the optimal solution, thus ensuring 1 2 signal dimension per user. On the other hand, for K > 4, simulations demonstrate the divergence of the algorithm for all of the 100 experiments. The difﬁculty comes from the fact that this heuristic formulation approximately solves O K 2 multilinear equations in O(K) unknowns. In general, we would not expect such an approach to work for arbitrary K, unless coding coefﬁcients were carefully designed to induce signiﬁcant dependencies among these equations.\nHere we present a class of K-user ICs where nontrivial fdof can be achieved in a ﬁnite number of symbol extensions. Let\nOur achievable scheme uses 2L number of time-slots to transmit 2K symbols. The two batches of symbols along with their corresponding fed back symbols are pipelined as in the previous 4-time-slot achievability schemes. At time-slot 1 the transmitters send x[1], while at time-slot 2 they send x[2], and they receive as feedback ˆ y[2] = H T Hx[1] = H 2 x[1]. Then, at time slot n ∈ {2, . . . , 2L} the received signals at the receiver side is y[n] = Hˆ y[n − 1] and ˆ y[n] = Hy[n − 1]. This means that after 2L timesolts the receiver end will have {Hx[1], H 3 x[1], . . . , H 2L−1 x[1]} and {Hx[2], H 3 x[2], . . . , H 2L−1 x[2]}. Using the eigen- value multiplicity, one can easily show that there ex- ist constants c 1 , . . . , c L such that \t L i=1 c i H 2i−1 x[1] =\nand L i=1 c i λ 2i−1 j = 1, ∀j ∈ [L] is a (Vandermonde) system of L equations in L unknowns, which admits a solution. Finding the c i coefﬁcients is therefore sufﬁcient for decoding the 2K transmitted symbols in 2L symbol extensions, thus achieving fdof = K L .\nWe gratefully acknowledge Dr. Viveck R.
