Each code vector c l = (c l,0 , · · · , c l,K−1 ) T , 0 ≤ l ≤ N − 1, has unit-norm, i.e., ||c l || = \t K−1 i=0 |c l,i | 2 = 1 , where T denotes the transpose. For the applications, we need a codebook C minimizing I max ( C) or the maximum magnitude of inner products between a pair of distinct code vectors. To evaluate an (N, K) codebook C, it is important to ﬁnd the minimum achievable I max ( C) or its lower bound. The Welch bound [1] provides\nwith equality if and only if for all pairs of (l, m) with l = m , c H l c m = \t N −K K(N −1) , where c H l is the conjugate transpose of c l . In particular, if I max ( C) meets the equality of the Welch bound, then C is called a maximum-Welch-bound- equality (MWBE) codebook [2].\nThe MWBE codebook, also known as an equiangular tight frame [3], has been of interest in a variety of research areas.\nUnfortunately, constructing an MWBE codebook in an analytic way is known to be extremely difﬁcult [2]. Due to the difﬁculty of constructing optimal codebooks, numerous attempts have been made to present a near-optimal codebook C where I max ( C) is slightly higher than the Welch bound equality, but asymptotically achieves the equality for sufﬁciently large N. A number of construction examples based on codes and signal sets can be found in [2]. Ding and Feng [4][5] also presented several near-optimal codebooks from almost difference sets. Generalizing this idea, Zhang and Feng [6][7] further con- structed near-optimal codebooks with almost difference sets and cyclotomic classes.\nThis paper discusses a framework for constructing an (N, K) codebook C with K < N, where each code vector is equivalent to a column of a K × N partial matrix. In the framework, we form the K × N matrix by selecting K rows from a J × N matrix Φ associated with a binary sequence a of length J and Hamming weight K, where a set of the selected row indices is equivalent to the index set of nonzero entries or the support of a. Throughout this paper, we denote the codebook as C Φ ( a). It is then found that I max ( C Φ ( a)) is determined by the maximum magnitude of Φ-transform of the binary sequence a. Thus, constructing a codebook C Φ ( a) with small I max ( C Φ ( a)) is equivalent to ﬁnding a binary sequence a where the maximum magnitude of its Φ-transform is as small as possible. In particular, if the support of the binary sequence forms a difference set, the framework can present an optimal codebook equivalent to the one constructed by Xia et al. [8], or Ding and Feng [9]. Also, if its support forms an almost difference set, the codebook may be equivalent to the one in [4] or [5]. However, we would like to stress that our framework may further present a new codebook with nontrivially bounded I max ( C Φ ( a)), even if the support of the associated sequence a does not form a difference (or almost difference) set. In addition, it presents an efﬁcient technique to develop an upper bound on I max ( C Φ ( a)) through the Φ- transform of an arbitrary binary sequence a.\nFor speciﬁc constructions, we present new near-optimal partial Fourier and Hadamard codebooks associated with bi- nary Sidelnikov sequences [10][11]. First of all, employing the N × N inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) matrix Φ = F, we construct an (N, K) near-optimal partial Fourier\ncodebook C F ( a) associated with a binary Sidelnikov sequence, where N = p m − 1 and K = N 2 for an odd prime p. Through the N-point IDFT of binary Sidelnikov sequences, it is easily proven that I max ( C F ( a)) is nontrivially bounded and nearly achieves the equality of the Welch bound. Second, we present a new (N, K) near-optimal partial Hadamard codebook C H ( a) from the N × N complex cyclic Hadamard matrix Φ = H associated with an extended binary Sidelnikov sequence, where N = p m and K = N −1 2 for an odd prime p. The Hadamard transform of the sequence reveals that I max ( C H ( a)) is nontrivially bounded and nearly achieves the Welch bound equality.\nThe following notations will be used throughout this paper. − Z N = {0, · · · , N − 1} is a ring of integers modulo N. − F q = GF(q) is a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements and F ∗ q =\n− F q [x] is a polynomial ring over F q where each coefﬁ- cient of f(x) ∈ F q [x] is an element of F q .\n− A binary sequence represents a = (a 0 , a 1 , · · · ) where a i ∈ Z 2 for all i = 0, 1, · · · . Its biphase version is then represented by Ψ( a) = ((−1) a 0 , ( −1) a 1 , · · · ).\n− Let p be prime, and m and k be positive integers with k | m.

The Hamming weight or the number of nonzero entries of a is denoted as wt( a) = |D| = K.\nFor a prime p and a positive integer m, let N = p m −1 and α be a primitive element in F p m . For some l, 1 ≤ l ≤ N − 1, a multiplicative character [12] of F p m can be deﬁned as\nwhere j = √ −1 and ψ(xy) = ψ(x)ψ(y) for x, y ∈ F p m . The order of a multiplicative character is deﬁned as the least\npositive integer M | p m − 1 such that ψ M (x) = 1 for all x ∈ F ∗ p m . The Weil bound [13] gives an upper bound on the magnitude of multiplicative character sums. We introduce the Weil bound as described in [14].\nTheorem 1: [14] Let f 1 (x), · · · , f h (x) be h monic, distinct, and irreducible polynomials in F q [x] which have the positive degrees d 1 , · · · , d h , respectively.

Then,\nThis section describes a framework of a codebook C Φ ( a) constructed from a matrix Φ associated with a binary sequence a. The framework employs a J × N matrix Φ with entries of φ i,l for 0 ≤ i ≤ J − 1 and 0 ≤ l ≤ N − 1, which has the following properties.\n1) Property 1: Each entry of Φ has unit magnitude, i.e., |φ i,l | = 1.\n2) Property 2: No pair of column vectors in Φ is identical. Moreover, the columns of Φ form a group under point- wise multiplication. In other words, for all l 1 , l 2 ∈ Z N , there exists an l ∈ Z N such that\nφ ∗ i,l 1 · φ i,l 2 = φ i,l , 0 ≤ i ≤ J − 1. \t (1) 3) Property 3: From Property 2, Φ has a column with all\none entries if l 1 = l 2 . Without loss of generality, we assume that it is the ﬁrst column, i.e., φ i,0 = 1 for all i, 0 ≤ i ≤ J − 1. In (1), l 1 = l 2 if and only if l = 0.\n4) Property 4: For l = 0, the elements of the lth column vector sum to zero, i.e., J−1 i=0 φ i,l = 0 .\nIn practice, typical examples of Φ having Properties 1 − 4 are the N × N Hadamard and Fourier matrices with J = N.\nNext, we deﬁne the Φ-transform of a binary sequence. Let a = (a 0 , a 1 , · · · , a J−1 ) be a binary sequence of length J and Hamming weight K, where a i ∈ Z 2 for 0 ≤ i ≤ J − 1. With a J × N matrix Φ having Properties 1 − 4, the Φ-transform of a is deﬁned by a = (a 0 , · · · , a N −1 ) = Ψ( a) · Φ, where each element of a is given by\nIn particular, if Φ is the N × N IDFT matrix, then the Φ- transform of a is equivalent to its inverse DFT. On the other hand, if Φ is the N × N Hadamard matrix, then the Φ- transform of a is equivalent to its Hadamard transform.\nConstruction 1 presents a framework of a codebook C Φ ( a) from a matrix Φ associated with a binary sequence a.\nConstruction 1: Let Φ be a J × N matrix with Properties 1 − 4, where each entry is denoted as φ i,l for 0 ≤ i ≤ J − 1 and 0 ≤ l ≤ N − 1. Let a = (a 0 , · · · , a J−1 ) be a binary sequence of length J and Hamming weight K, and D = {d 0 , · · · , d K−1 } be its support. Consider a K × N partial matrix selecting K rows from Φ, where the selected row indices are from D. With the scaling factor of 1 √ K , the l th column vector of the partial matrix is given as\nThen, C Φ ( a) = {c 0 , c 1 , · · · , c N −1 } is an (N, K) codebook from the matrix Φ associated with the binary sequence a. We also say that a is the characteristic sequence of C Φ ( a).\nTheorem 3: In the (N, K) codebook C Φ ( a) from Construc- tion 1, the maximum magnitude of inner products of distinct code vectors is given by\nProof: The inner product of a pair of distinct code vectors is given by\n= 1 K\nwhere J−1 i=0 φ i,l = 0 for l = 0 from Property 4. From (2) and (3), we have\n2 Corollary 1 gives a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for\nCorollary 1: An (N, K) codebook C Φ ( a) is MWBE if and only if |a l | = 2 K(N −K) (N−1) for 1 ≤ l ≤ N − 1.\nTheorem 3 shows that I max ( C Φ ( a)) is determined by the maximum magnitude of Φ-transform of the characteristic sequence a. Therefore, constructing a codebook C Φ ( a) with small I max ( C Φ ( a)) is equivalent to ﬁnding a binary sequence a where the maximum magnitude of its Φ-transform is as small as possible. The discovery reveals a theoretical connection between a binary sequence a and its associated codebook C Φ ( a) from a matrix Φ.\nIn Construction 1, we set J = N and Φ = F, where F is the N × N IDFT matrix with entries of f i,l = e j 2πil N for 0 ≤ i, l ≤ N − 1, where j =\nnikov [10], and revisited by Lempel, Cohn, and Eastman [11]. We deﬁne the sequence using log operation.\nDeﬁnition 1: Let α be a primitive element in F p m for an odd prime p and a positive integer m. A binary Sidel- nikov sequence of period N = p m − 1 is deﬁned as a = (a 0 , · · · , a N −1 ) where\na i ≡ log α (α i + 1) mod 2, 0 ≤ i ≤ p m − 2. (4) In (4), note that α i = −1 if and only if i = p m −1 2 , where\na i = 0 . It is well known [11] that the binary Sidelnikov sequence of period p m − 1 is balanced, or wt(a) = p m −1 2 . In the following, Lemma 1 studies the N-point IDFT of the binary Sidelnikov sequence.\nLemma 1: The magnitude of the N-point IDFT of a binary Sidelnikov sequence a of length N = p m − 1 is bounded by\nProof: Let ψ 1 be a multiplicative character of order 2 of F p m , i.e., ψ 1 (x) = e jπ log α x = ( −1) log α x for x ∈ F ∗ p m . Hence, the biphase \u2018 ±1\u2019 sequence of a is represented by (−1) a i = ψ 1 (α i + 1) if i = p m −1 2 , or ( −1) a i = 1 if i = p m −1 2 .\nIf l = 0, then a 0 = N −1 i=0 ( −1) a i = N − 2wt(a) = 0 from wt( a) = N 2 . If l = 0, then ( −1) a i = ψ 1 (α i + 1) for i = N 2 . Let ψ 2 be a multiplicative character with ψ 2 (α i ) = e j 2πil N for each l, 1 ≤ l ≤ N − 1. Then, for l = 0,\nψ 1 (x + 1) · ψ 2 (x) ≤ 1 + √ p m\nwhere the last inequality is from the Weil bound in Theorem 1. Thus, the upper bound of (5) is immediate for any l. \t 2\nNext, Theorem 4 develops an upper bound on I max ( C F ( a)) for the partial Fourier codebook C F ( a) associated with a binary Sidelnikov sequence a. The proof is straightforward from Theorem 3 and Lemma 1.\nTheorem 4: Let a be a binary Sidelnikov sequence of length N = p m − 1. Construction 1 gives an (N, K) partial Fourier codebook C F ( a) associated with a, where K = N/2. Then, I max ( C F ( a)) is bounded by\nTable I demonstrates that the upper bound is very tight and close to the Welch bound equality N −K K(N −1) = 1 √ 2K−1 for large N = 2K. We observe that the partial Fourier codebook C F ( a) associated with a binary Sidelnikov sequence nearly achieves the equality of the Welch bound.\nRemark 1: In the codebook C F ( a), the support of the binary Sidelnikov sequence a is equivalent to the almost difference set (ADS) in Lemma 18 of [5]. The authors of [5] conjectured that the ADS would certainly yield a near-optimal codebook, but failed to compute I max ( C F ( a)) or its upper bound for general N and K. Recently, we were aware that Zhang and Feng [7] developed an upper bound on I max ( C F ( a)) utilizing the Jacobi sums, in an attempt to support the conjecture of [5]. In Theorem 4, we presented a new upper bound on I max ( C F ( a)) that could be easily obtained by the N-point IDFT of a binary Sidelnikov sequence, nearly meeting the equality of the Welch bound. From numerical experiments, we also observed that our new upper bound is tighter than Zhang and Feng\u2019s bound for the codebooks in Table I.\nDeﬁnition 2: Let N = p m for a prime p and a positive integer m. Let α be a primitive element of the ﬁnite ﬁeld F p m . An N × N cyclic Hadamard matrix H has the entries of\nRemark 2: With p = 2, Deﬁnition 2 gives a binary cyclic Hadamard matrix H with entries of ±1 via trace functions. Employing the binary Hadamard matrix H and a binary se- quence a from a trace-type bent function [17], Construction 1 presents a codebook C H ( a). As a is bent, its Hadamard transform is two-valued, and it is readily checked that C H ( a) is MWBE with N = 2 m and K = N ± √ N 2 for even m. In fact, C H ( a) is a trace version of the MWBE codebook in Corollary 4 of [9] in which the matrix and the characteristic sequence are deﬁned by Boolean functions.\nNext, we present a new near-optimal codebook from a complex cyclic Hadamard matrix associated with an extended binary Sidelnikov sequence.\nTheorem 5: For an odd prime p, consider a binary sequence a = (0 | u) of length N = p m , where u is a binary Sidelnikov sequence of length p m − 1 in Deﬁnition 1, and \u2018|\u2019 denotes a concatenation. Clearly, the Hamming weight of a is K = wt( a) = N −1 2 . Associated with a, Construction 1 presents an (N, K) partial Hadamard codebook C H ( a) from the complex cyclic Hadamard matrix H in Deﬁnition 2, where\nProof: With a 0 = 0 and a i = u i−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1, the biphase \u2018 ±1\u2019 sequence of a is represented by\ni−1 + 1), \t if i = 0 and i = p m +1 2 , 1, \t if i = 0 or i = p m +1 2\nwhere ψ is a multiplicative character of order 2 of F p m . In Deﬁnition 2, each entry of the Hadamard matrix H is represented by an additive character χ(λx) = e j 2π p Tr m 1 (λx) , where x = 0 or α i−1 , and λ = 0 or α l−1 for 1 ≤ i, l ≤ N −1. The magnitude of the Hadamard transform of a is given by\nψ(x + 1)χ(λx) + 1 ≤ √ p m + 1\nwhere the last inequality is from the hybrid sum bound in Theorem 2. Therefore,\nI max ( C H ( a)) = 1 2K · max 1≤l≤N−1 |a l | ≤\nTable II demonstrates that I max ( C H ( a)) is tightly bounded by the upper bound in Theorem 5, and nearly achieves the Welch bound equality N −K K(N −1) = √ 2K+2 2K .\nThis paper has described a framework for constructing a codebook C Φ ( a) from a matrix Φ associated with a binary sequence a. In the framework, I max ( C Φ ( a)) is determined by the maximum magnitude of Φ-transform of the sequence a. Thus, constructing a codebook with small I max ( C Φ ( a)) is equivalent to ﬁnding a binary sequence a where the maximum magnitude in its Φ-transform is as small as possible. Com- pared to [4] −[9], the framework presents an efﬁcient technique for determining the maximum possible value of I max ( C Φ ( a)) for an arbitrary binary sequence a. Through the framework, we may enjoy a freedom of choosing a variety of binary sequences a to construct new codebooks with nontrivially bounded I max ( C Φ ( a)). Associated with binary Sidelnikov sequences, we presented new near-optimal partial codebooks C Φ ( a) by efﬁciently proving the upper bounds of I max ( C Φ ( a)), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework.\nTheoretically, this paper made a contribution of discover- ing a connection between binary sequences and the associ- ated codebooks. The connection showed that various known and new codebooks could be constructed from Fourier and Hadamard matrices associated with binary sequences."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"L. R.
