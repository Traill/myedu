In this paper, a new malicious user detection method based on two proposed Conditional Frequency Check (CFC) statistics is developed with a Markovian spectrum model.

Along with all the beneﬁts, collaborative spectrum sensing also induces security vulnerabilities [2], among which the Byzantine attack [3] (a.k.a. spectrum sensing data falsiﬁ- cation (SSDF) attack [4]) is the focus of this paper.\nMany existing defenses against Byzantine attacks are rep- utation based, e.g., [5\u20138]. In this type of methods, lower reputations will be assigned to sensors that deviate from the global decision to mitigate the negative effects of the malicious sensors. However, the underlying assumption is that the global decision is correct, which may not be true when malicious sensors dominate the network. In fact, it has been shown in [3] [9] that when Byzantine attackers in the network exceed a certain fraction, such reputation based methods become completely incapable. 1 Non-reputation based approaches have also been proposed, such as [10\u201312]. However, these methods still rely on the correctness of the global decision and hence only investigate the scenarios where a small fraction of users are malicious. When the majority are not trustworthy, global decision independent approaches are more suitable. Such type of works include the prior-probability aided method proposed in [13], and the user-centric misbehavior detection presented in [14].\nIn practice usually there is memory in the spectrum state evolvement, and the spectrum occupancy is more precisely modeled by a Markov model. Most of the existing methods either consider the i.i.d. spectrum state model for simplicity\n(e.g., [10,12,14]), or focus their analysis on one time slot and ignore the correlation between the spectrum states at consecutive time slots (e.g., [3,5\u20138,11]). In [13], the Markov property of the spectrum is incorporated into the malicious user detection algorithm; however, it is generally difﬁcult to obtain the required prior knowledge of the true spectrum in practice.\nIn this paper, a global decision independent method, the Conditional Frequency Check (CFC), is proposed based on a Markov spectrum model to combat the Byzantine attacks. In particular, two CFC statistics, which explore the second order property of the Markov model, are constructed in this paper. The corresponding analysis proves that these two proposed CFC statistics together with an auxiliary hamming distance check are capable of detecting any sensor that misbehaves. In addition, two consistent histogram estimators based on the history of sensors\u2019 reports are also developed for these two CFC statistics. With the aid of one trusted sensor, the proposed method is capable of detecting any malicious sensor with high accuracy regardless of the portion of malicious ones in the sensor group, without requiring any prior knowledge of the spectrum and sensing models.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II formulates the problem. The proposed malicious sensor detection method and the corresponding theoretical analysis are presented in Section III. Some supporting simulation results are presented in Section IV, and Section V concludes the paper.\nIn this paper, the following scenario is considered: 1) The true spectrum has two states, i.e., 0 (idle) and 1 (occupied), and follows a homogeneous Markov model with state transition matrix A = [a ij ] 2×2 (i, j ∈ {0, 1}) where a ij P r(s t+1 = j |s t = i) and s t denotes the true spectrum state at time t. The stationary state distribution is denoted by π = [π 0 , π 1 ], which satisﬁes πA = π. In addition, it is assumed that the Markov chain of spectrum states is in equilibrium. 2) One trusted honest sensor exists and is known by the fusion center. 3) All sensors, including malicious ones, have the same spectrum sensing capability, i.e., identical detection probabilities P d \u2019s and false alarm probabilities P f a \u2019s. 2 4) An honest sensor will send its local sensing result directly to the fusion center. 5)\nA malicious sensor, however, will tamper its local inference before reporting to the fusion center. In particular, she will ﬂip local inference from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 with probabilities ϕ 01 and ϕ 10 , respectively. The ﬂipping probabilities ϕ may not necessarily be the same for different malicious sensors. From the fusion center\u2019s viewpoint, the equivalent detection and false alarm probabilities of a malicious sensor with ﬂipping probabilities ϕ [ϕ 01 , ϕ 10 ] are given by\nP (M) f a = (1 − ϕ 10 )P f a + ϕ 01 (1 − P f a ). \t (2) If a malicious sensor attacks, i.e., {ϕ 01 , ϕ 10 } = {0, 0}, her\nstatistical behaviors will deviate from that of the honest sensor. The objective of this paper is to detect the malicious sensors by observing their statistical deviations.\nThe proposed malicious sensor detection method consists of two phases: 1) conditional frequency check (CFC), and 2) an auxiliary hamming distance check (HDC).\nAccording to the preceding model, a malicious sensor has two degrees of freedom, i.e., two parameters ϕ 01 and ϕ 10 , in launching an attack. The convectional frequency check, which detects malicious sensors by computing their frequencies of reporting 1 [10], enforces only one constraint to the attacker\u2019s behavior as indicated in Eq.(6) below. This is insufﬁcient to prevent the malicious sensor from attacking. However, when the true spectrum states are Markovian, the proposed CFC can enforce two constraints by exploring the correlation between consecutive spectrum states, and consequently identify any ﬂipping attack easily. In particular, the CFC consists of two statistics as deﬁned below.\nDeﬁnition 1: The two conditional frequency check statistics of a sensor are deﬁned as Ψ 1 P r(r t = 1|r t−1 = 1), and Ψ 0 P r(r t = 0|r t−1 = 0), respectively, where r t denotes the sensor\u2019s report at time t.\nAccording to the deﬁnitions, these two statistics are related to the model parameters as\nIn the CFC, the fusion center will evaluate Ψ 1 and Ψ 0 for every sensor and compare the resulting values with those of the trusted sensor. If the values are sufﬁciently different, the corresponding sensor will be identiﬁed as malicious. In the following, the effectiveness of this statistical check is demon- strated through two analytical results, followed by a practical approach to estimating these two statistics that eliminates the requirement of any prior knowledge about the sensing and spectrum models.\nProposition 1: For the Markov spectrum model considered in this paper, any sensor that survives the CFC can pass the FC.\nProof: A malicious sensor can pass the FC as long as P r(r (M) t = 1) = P r(r (tr) t = 1), where r (M) t (r (tr) t ) denotes the malicious (trusted) sensor\u2019s report at time t. However, she needs to achieve Ψ (M) 0 = Ψ (tr) 0 and Ψ (M) 1 = Ψ (tr) 1 to survive the CFC.\nNote that P r(r (tr) t = i) = P r(r (tr) t−1 = i) (i ∈ {0, 1}) when the true spectrum states are in equilibrium, and P r(r (tr) t = 1) = Ψ (tr) 1 P r(r (tr) t−1 = 1) + (1 − Ψ (tr) 0 )P r(r (tr) t−1 = 0). Consequently, for any sensor that survives the CFC, we have\nProposition 2: If a 10 P f a +a 01 P d a 10 +a 01 \t = 1 2 , a malicious sensor can never pass the CFC if she attacks, i.e., {ϕ 01 , ϕ 10 } = {0, 0}. If a 10 P f a +a 01 P d a 10 +a 01 = 1 2 , an active malicious sensor can pass the CFC only if she sets {ϕ 01 , ϕ 10 } to {1, 1}.\nProof: According to Proposition 1, passing the FC is a necessary condition for a malicious sensor to pass the CFC. Thus, ϕ must satisfy π 0 P (M) f a + π 1 P (M) d = P r(r (M) t = 1) = P r(r (tr) t = 1) = π 0 P f a + π 1 P d . Considering (1) and (2), this implies the following linear constraint on ϕ 01 and ϕ 10 :\nWhen (6) holds, deﬁne g 1 (ϕ 10 ) (π 0 P f a +π 1 P d )·(Ψ (M) 1 − Ψ (tr) 1 ). After some algebra, it can be shown that\ng 1 (ϕ 10 ) = ϕ 2 10 κ 2 1 [π 0 π 2 1 a 00 − (π 1 a 10 + π 0 a 01 )π 1 π 0 \t (7) +π 1 π 2 0 a 11 ] + ϕ 10 κ 1 [−2π 1 π 0 a 00 P f a\nNote that the malicious sensor can pass the CFC only if she could ﬁnd a ϕ ∗ = [ϕ ∗ 01 , ϕ ∗ 10 ] that satisﬁes both g 1 (ϕ ∗ 10 ) = 0 (i.e., Ψ (M) 1 = Ψ (tr) 1 ) and (6). Denote ϕ ∗ 10 as the non-zero root of g 1 (ϕ 10 ) = 0, which can be found as:\nξ 2 = −2π 1 π 0 a 00 P f a + (π 1 a 10 + π 0 a 01 ) · (π 0 P f a − π 1 P d ) +2π 1 π 0 a 11 P d .\nConsider the relation πA = π, (8) and (9) can be simpliﬁed as\na 10 + a 01 \t . \t (11) As a direct consequence of (10) and (11), ϕ ∗ 10 + ϕ ∗ 01 = 2 must hold if the malicious sensor wants to pass the CFC. On the other hand, 0 ≤ ϕ ∗ 01 , ϕ ∗ 10 ≤ 1 by deﬁnition. These two condi- tions imply that {ϕ ∗ 01 , ϕ ∗ 10 } exists only if 2(a 10 P f a +a 01 P d) a 10 +a 01 \t = 1 and the corresponding {ϕ ∗ 01 , ϕ ∗ 10 } equals {1, 1}. Otherwise, there is no valid non-zero solution for both g 1 (ϕ 10 ) = 0 and (6). That is, the malicious sensor cannot pass the CFC if she attacks.\nDeﬁne the error function e(ϕ) ||Ψ (tr) − Ψ (M) || 2 , where Ψ (tr) [Ψ (tr) 1 , Ψ (tr) 0 ] and Ψ (M) [Ψ (M) 1 , Ψ (M) 0 ] are the CFC statistics of the trusted and the malicious sensor, respectively. A typical ﬁgure of e(ϕ) when the condition a 10 P f a +a 01 P d a 10 +a 01 = 1 2 holds is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, {1, 1} is the only blind spot of the CFC. In contrast, the conventional FC only enforces a linear constraint (6) on the attacker, thus forming a blind line as indicated in Fig. 1.\nDeﬁnition 2: For any sensor, two histogram estimators for Ψ 1 and Ψ 0 are deﬁned as:\nrespectively, where δ i,j = 1 iff i = j and T is the detection window length.\nProposition 3: The two estimators ˆ Ψ 1 and ˆ Ψ 0 converge to Ψ 1 and Ψ 0 , respectively, as T → ∞.\nRemark 1: According to Proposition 3, the CFC statistics of all honest sensors (including the trusted one) will converge\nto the same value, i.e., Ψ (tr) . On the other hand, the CFC statistics of any malicious sensor will converge to some value Ψ (M) (depending on its ϕ), which is different from Ψ (tr) according to Proposition 2. Therefore, any sensor whose CFC statistics differs from that of the trusted sensor is malicious.\nIn practice, the values of the two CFC statistics between any two honest sensors may be different due to ﬁnite detection window length T . For this concern, only when the difference between the CFC statistics of a sensor and those of the trusted sensor is larger than a pre-speciﬁed threshold β CF C , will this sensor be identiﬁed as malicious. The proposed CFC procedure with threshold β CF C is summarized in Algorithm 1.\nCompute ˆ Ψ 1 (tr) and ˆ Ψ 0 (tr) for the trusted sensor according to (12) and (13). for sensor i do\nCompute ˆ Ψ 1 (i) and ˆ Ψ 0 (i) according to (12) and (13). if || ˆΨ (tr) − ˆΨ (i) || 2 > β CF C then\nClassify sensor i as malicious. end if\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the CFC fails to detect the malicious sensor using ϕ = {1, 1} when a 10 P f a +a 01 P d a 10 +a 01 = 1 2 . This may happen when a 10 = a 01 and P d + P f a = 1. However, in this case, a large normalized hamming distance between the report sequences from a malicious sensor i and the trusted sensor, which is deﬁned as d h (i, tr) \t 1 T T\n, will be expected because of the high local inference ﬂipping probability at the malicious sensor. Based on this observation, sensor i will be identiﬁed as malicious if d h (i, tr) is greater than a pre-speciﬁed threshold β HDC .\nTwo different cases are simulated. In both cases P d = 0.9 and P f a = 0.1, but in the ﬁrst case, A = [ 0.8 0.2 0.2 0.8 ], and in the second case, A = [ 0.8 0.2 0.4 0.6 ]. Thus, the condition\n= 1 2 is satisﬁed in the ﬁrst case but not in the second one. Every malicious sensor randomly selects its own {ϕ 01 , ϕ 10 } according to uniform distribution over (0, 1] 2 . The thresholds are set as β CF C = 0.2 and β HDC = 0.3. There are n H = 8 honest sensors and n M = 13 malicious sensors, i.e., the malicious sensors dominate the network. The detection window length is T = 100(time slot). At the fusion center, the majority voting rule is used.\nSimulation results of a typical run of the ﬁrst case are shown in Fig. 2\u2013Fig. 4. In particular, by comparing Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, it can be seen that two malicious sensors whose ﬂipping probabilities ϕ 01 and ϕ 10 are close to 1 successfully pass the CFC. However, these two malicious sensors fail to pass the subsequent HDC. Also, it can be seen by comparing Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 that there is one malicious user surviving both CFC and HDC. Further examination reveals that the ﬂipping\nprobabilities of this malicious user are low: ϕ 01 ≈ 0 and ϕ 10 ≈ 0.1. Although this malicious sensor is not detected, its negative inﬂuence on the spectrum sensing result of the fusion center is negligible.\nTable I summarizes the simulation results over 100 Monte Carlo runs for both cases. The proposed method achieves nearly perfect sensing results in both cases, i.e., P d = 0.9956 and P f a = 0.0006 in the ﬁrst case, and P d = 0.9958 and P f a = 0.0008 in the second case, which are signiﬁcantly better than the sensing performances of both the single trusted sensor and that of using all sensors without malicious sensor detection. Besides, the proposed algorithm also provides high malicious sensor detection accuracy (η > 95%) in both cases.\nA new method consisting of two CFC statistics and an auxiliary HDC procedure has been proposed in this paper for malicious user detection under a Markov spectrum model. By using the two consistent histogram estimators of the CFC statistics, the proposed method does not require any prior knowledge of the spectrum and sensing models for malicious sensor detection. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed method, with the assistance of a trusted sensor, can achieve high malicious user detection ac- curacy, and thus signiﬁcantly improves collaborative spectrum\nsensing performance. The proposed method does not rely on global decision and thus is effective even when the malicious sensors dominate the network.\nX t i in which X t i is deﬁned as\nwhere t i is the time slot for the i-th reported 1 of the sensor. To prove the convergence of ˆ Ψ 1 , we need to prove 1) E( ˆ Ψ 1 ) = Ψ 1 , which is simple to show by noticing that E(X t ) = P r(r t+1 = 1|r t = 1) = Ψ 1 ; 2) lim\nV ar( ˆ Ψ 1 ) = 0. In general, X t \u2019s are not independent due to the correlation between the consecutive true spectrum states in the Markov model. Thus, the central limit theorem can not be applied. However, we will show the second fact is true by ﬁrst proving that the correlation between X i and X j (i > j) vanishes as (i − j) approaches inﬁnity. That is,\n= P r(r j+1 = 1|r j = 1)[P r(s i+1 = 1|r i = 1, r j = 1)P d +P r(s i+1 = 0|r i = 1, r j = 1)P f a ]\n= P r(r j+1 = 1|r j = 1)[P r(s i+1 = 1|r i = 1)P d +P r(s i+1 = 0|r i = 1)P f a ].\nComparing the two preceding equations, it can be seen that, to prove (15), it is sufﬁcient to prove\nNote that P r(s i+1 = 1|r i = 1) is given as P r(s i+1 = 1|r i = 1)\n= 1) + P f a P r(s i = 0) = π 1 P d a 11 + π 0 P f a a 01 π\nand P r(s i+1 = 1|r i = 1, r j = 1) is given as 3 P r(s i+1 = 1|r i = 1, r j = 1)\nwhere p (11) n \t P r(s n+j = 1|s j = 1) and p (00) n \t P r(s n+j = 0|s j = 0). According to the deﬁnition, the following recursive relation holds for p (11) n ,\n1−a 00 +a 10 . Substituting these two expressions into (17), it can be veriﬁed that P r(s i+1 = 1|r i = 1, r j = 1) =\n= P r(s i+1 |r i = 1) as i − j approaches inﬁnity. Therefore (15) holds.\nV ar( ˆ Ψ 1 ) = 0. For any positive δ, ∃ K δ such that |Cov(X i , X j )| < δ/2 when |i − j| > K δ due to (15). Also, given K δ , ∃ N δ such that 4K δ < δN δ . Then, for any n 1 > N δ , we have V ar( ˆ Ψ 1 ) =\nV ar( ˆ Ψ 1 ) = 0. On the other hand, for any ﬁnite N δ , n 1 > N δ with probability 1 when T approaches inﬁnity, which implies lim\nV ar( ˆ Ψ 1 ) = 0. Therefore, ˆ Ψ 1 converges to Ψ 1 . Following the same approach, it can be shown that ˆ Ψ 0 converges to Ψ 0 ."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"I. F. Akyildiz"},{"name":"B. F. Lo"},{"name":"R.
