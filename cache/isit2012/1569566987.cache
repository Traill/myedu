Given presence of interference, a receiver can either treat interference as noise (IAN receiver) or try to decode interference (joint decoding receiver) even though it is not ultimately interested in decoding interference. For an IAN receiver, larger interference would always result in higher noise ﬂoor, so reducing interference would be a good transmission strategy. This strategy has been well adopted in the traditional wireless system design in the form of orthogonal multiplexing schemes. When a receiver has multiple dimensions of observation, aligning interference into sub-dimensions was shown to achieve the optimal degrees of freedom (DOF) which is strictly greater than that of orthogonal multiplexing schemes for certain cases [1]. Still, the focus of the transmission strategy is to provide interference-free dimension by assuming an IAN receiver.\nAlthough aforementioned interference-alignment has brought surprisingly good result with the assumption of an IAN receiver, it turns out that a receiver needs to decode interference in some degree if one is interested in the optimal achievable rate, i.e. capacity. When a receiver is willing to decode interference, reducing interference or providing interference-free dimension is not necessarily a good strategy. Han and Kobayashi looked at this problem more than 30 years ago and proposed well-known Han-Kobayashi (HK) scheme for two user interference channel (IC) [2]. In the HK scheme, message of each transmitter is divided into common\nand private part. It is the common part of message which needs to be decoded at the both receivers. Finding capacity for this simple two user IC is still an open problem, and the HK scheme is the best known strategy. Recently Etkin, Tse and Wang considered two user single-input, single-output (SISO) Gaussian IC, and proposed a scheme (ETW scheme) which achieves one bit gap to the capacity [3]. The ETW scheme is a simpler version of the HK scheme with ﬁxed common-private splitting, but is still shown to be close to the capacity.\nAforementioned result for two user SISO Gaussian IC was generalized for two user multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian IC in [4], [5], and it was shown that the ETW-like scheme achieves the constant gap to the capacity. When there are more than two tranceiver pairs, there are very few capacity-like results. It is shown that the ETW-like scheme is generalized DOF (GDOF) optimal for certain classes of K user MIMO Gaussian IC [6], [7]. In K user SISO Gaussian IC, signal level alignment is shown to achieve GDOF of symmetric case. This signal level alignment was also used to show GDOF result of many-to-one IC [8] and two user X-channel [9].\nAforementioned capacity-like results are based on schemes which require coordination of transmitters and/or knowledge of the interfering channel at each transmitter. Baccelli et al. investigated capacity of K user SISO Gaussian IC when there is neither transmitter coordination nor knowledge of the interfering channel [10]. It can be easily seen that this strategy is not even GDOF optimal, and hence, it exhibits inﬁnite gap to the capacity as transmit power goes to inﬁnity. This implies that the optimal coding scheme for IC could be signiﬁcantly different from the optimal coding scheme for p2p channel, and this aspect is explored in [11] to show that \u201cbad\u201d LDPC codes for p2p channel can be \u201cgood\u201d codes for IC. Nevertheless, performance of JD receiver is shown to be considerably better than IAN receiver even when p2p-capacity-achieving codes are used [10].\nMotivated by this result, we investigate performances of \u201csimple\u201d transmission strategies in this paper. We ﬁrst consider two user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC. In this case, the ETW scheme is already shown to be near-optimal by its one bit gap to the capacity. Surprisingly, it turns out that the p2p coding scheme performs better or as nearly good as\nthe ETW scheme. Next, we consider K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC. When there are more than two users, the HK or the ETW scheme is known to be not even GDOF optimal. Unfortunately, the only capacity-like result for more than two user case is obtained only for symmetric IC using signal level alignment as mentioned earlier, and practically implementing this signal level alignment would be quite challenging. Therefore, evaluating performance of simple strategies could have signiﬁcant meaning for practical purpose. In this paper, we deﬁne interference regimes for K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC and provide closed-form characterization of the symmetric rates achieved by the p2p coding scheme and by the ETW scheme. Using this characterization, we evaluate performances of simple strategies with K = 3, and show that the p2p coding scheme still performs well with respect to the ETW scheme for practical SNR range.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, performance evaluation of simple strategies along with characterization of the symmetric rate is done for two user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC. In section III, characterization of the symmetric rates with the p2p scheme and with the ETW scheme is done, and performance evaluation is provided for K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC. Section IV concludes the paper. Due to space limitation, all proofs are excluded, and we refer readers to the full version [12].\nA. Interference regimes and achievable region of p2p- capacity-achieving codes\nLet us deﬁne two user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC with channel inputs X 1 , X 2 and channel outputs Y 1 , Y 2 as follows.\naP X 2 + Z 1 \t (1) Y 2 =\nwhere a, P > 0 and Z 1 , Z 2 ∼ CN (0, 1). Note that P represents signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and a represents interference-to-signal ratio (ISR). Because the channel is sym- metric, we have\nI(X 1 ; Y 1 ) = I(X 2 ; Y 2 ), \t (3a) I(X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) = I(X 2 ; Y 2 |X 1 ), \t (3b)\nI(X 1 ; Y 2 ) = I(X 2 ; Y 1 ), \t (3c) I(X 1 ; Y 2 |X 2 ) = I(X 2 ; Y 1 |X 1 ). \t (3d)\nFor this channel, we would like to deﬁne four interference regimes according to interference level. In noisy interference regime, I(X 1 ; Y 1 ) ≥ I(X 1 ; Y 2 |X 2 ) holds. Roughly speaking, this implies that interference-affected version of the direct link (X 1 to Y 1 ) is better than interference-free version of the cross link(X 1 to Y 2 ). In Gaussian channel, noisy interference regime corresponds to the range of a ≤ −1+\n. In weak interference regime, I(X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) ≥ I(X 1 ; Y 2 |X 2 ) > I(X 1 ; Y 1 ) holds which implies that interference-free version of the direct link is better than interference-free version of the cross link. In Gaussian channel, this corresponds to the\n< a ≤ 1. In strong interference regime, I(X 1 ; Y 2 |X 2 ) > I(X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) ≥ I(X 1 ; Y 2 ) holds which\nimplies that interference-free version of the cross link is better than interference-free version of the direct link. In Gaussian channel, this corresponds to the range of 1 < a ≤ 1 + P . In very strong interference regime, I(X 1 ; Y 2 ) > I(X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) holds which implies that interference-affected version of the cross link is better than interference-free version of the direct link. In Gaussian channel, this corresponds to the range of a > 1 + P .\nAs in [10], we deﬁne p2p-capacity-achieving codes as length n block codes which achieves a rate of R over ev- ery p2p Gaussian channel with capacity greater than R as n → ∞. Note that p2p-capacity-achieving codes excludes the HK or the ETW schemes. In [10], capacity region with p2p- capacity-achieving codes is characterized. For noisy interfer- ence regime, it is given as union of C 0 and C 1 which are\nC 0 = {(R 1 , R 2 ) : R 1 < I(X 1 ; Y 1 ), R 2 < I(X 2 ; Y 2 ) } , (4a) C 1 = {(R 1 , R 2 ) : R 1 < I(X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 ), R 2 < I(X 2 ; Y 2 |X 1 ),\nNote that C 0 corresponds to the achievable region of IAN receiver, and C 1 corresponds to the achievable region of simultaneous decoding receiver which is deﬁned in [13] and used in [10]. For weak, strong and very strong interference regimes, the capacity region is equal to C 1 , which means treating interference as noise is meaningful only if interference is very weak. For very strong interference regime, the sum- rate bound in C 1 is actually ineffective, i.e. decodability of intended message without interference is limiting factor because interference decoding is easy due to strong interfer- ence, and the capacity region is given as C \u2032 1 = {(R 1 , R 2 ) : R 1 < I(X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 ), R 2 < I(X 2 ; Y 2 |X 1 ) }. For very strong interference regime, the capacity of each user is the same as no interference case. It has also been shown that the capacity region of p2p-capacity-achieving codes are equal to the capacity region in strong and very strong interference regimes [2], [14], [15]. Pictorial explanation of these capacity regions can be seen in the full version [12].\nLet us deﬁne the symmetric rate (C sym ) of a scheme as C sym = max (R 1 ,R 2 ) ∈R min {R 1 , R 2 }, where R is the achiev- able region of a scheme. Since p2p-capacity-achieving codes are known to achieve the capacity region of strong and very strong interference regimes, we only consider noisy and weak interference regimes. Achievable region of a \u201csimpler than the ETW\u201d scheme considered in this section is the union of the aforementioned capacity region of the p2p-capacity-achieving codes and the achievable region of a TDMA scheme in which only one of two users transmit at each time. For convenience, let us call this uniﬁed scheme as the \u201cp2p scheme\u201d. It is well known that a TDMA scheme is far from GDOF optimal, and hence may be thought as a \u201cbad\u201d scheme. Surprisingly, it will be seen that it is difﬁcult to outperform a TDMA for\npractical SNR range in noisy and weak interference regimes. For simplicity, performance comparison will be done in terms of the symmetric rate. Since the TDMA scheme achieves the symmetric rate of 1 2 log 2 (1 + 2P ) regardless of interference regime, it is easy to see that the symmetric rate of the p2p scheme is given as follows.\n. (5)\nThe symmetric rate of the ETW scheme is given in [3] as follows.\n            \nNote that the above symmetric rate is obtained by sub-optimal decoding in which common messages are jointly decoded with treating private messages as noise, and a private message is decoded given decoded common messages as explained in [3]. As pointed out in [2], [16], jointly decoding all messages at the same time can be better than this sub-optimal decoding. It turns out that the aforementioned sub-optimal decoding is no different from joint decoding in terms of the symmetric rate, and it is pointed out in Remark 4 of [2]. From now on we call the symmetric rate of the ETW scheme as C ET W sym . Now let us state the result for noisy interference regime.\nTheorem 1 implies that IAN decoding with p2p codes performs better than the ETW scheme in noisy interference regime. Similar phenomenon can be seen in [3] in terms of GDOF although characterization of interference regimes in this paper is slightly different from that in [3].\nLet us see how these two schemes compares in weak interference regime. Deﬁne\n< a ≤ 1, we have for P ≤ P \u2032 where P \u2032 = sup {P : f(a 1 ) <\nIt can be easily veriﬁed that f (a 1 ) < 0 when P = 100 which implies that P \u2032 ≥ 100. Thus, we have the following corollary.\n< a ≤ 1, we have\n< a ≤ 1, we have for P ≤ P \u2032\u2032 where P \u2032\u2032 = sup {P : f(a 2 ) <\nIt can be easily veriﬁed that f (a 2 ) < 0 when P = 1000 which implies that P \u2032\u2032 ≥ 1000. Thus, we have the following corollary.\n< a ≤ 1, we have\nResults obtained in this section imply that the ETW scheme performs closely to or is outperformed by the p2p scheme when SNR ≤ 30 dB. This is surprising given the fact that the ETW scheme is known to be near-optimal, and implies that more complicated message splitting is possibly needed in order to signiﬁcantly outperform the p2p scheme. Although there are several ways to justify the choice of simple message splitting used in the ETW scheme as discussed in [3], it was also pointed out in [3] that this could very well be sub-optimal. One intuition of simple message splitting can be obtained from deterministic modeling [17], [18] in which private information is assigned for the level under noise ﬂoor to achieve the capacity. In deterministic modeling, this choice is straightforward because no information is delivered under noise ﬂoor, but it is not necessarily the case with Gaussian IC due to randomness of noise. The effort of ﬁnding better message splitting was given in [19], and certain value of a was found for which a version of the HK scheme performs better than the p2p scheme.\nLet us deﬁne K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC with channel inputs X 1 ,..., X K and channel outputs Y 1 ,..., Y K as follows.\nwhere a, P > 0 and Z i ∼ CN (0, 1). As mentioned earlier, signal level alignment is shown to achieve GDOF of this channel, and HK-like scheme would be sub-optimal. This is because of violation of \u201cinterference decodability\u201d in this channel, which can be easily understood via deterministic modeling [6], [17]. Nevertheless, investigating performances of simple strategies still can be meaningful given the fact that these are considerably easier to implement.\nSuppose there is no coordination among transmitters and no message splitting at each transmitter. As in two user case, we are interested in the symmetric rate as a performance metric. To ﬁnd the symmetric rate, we need to evaluate achievable region of this scheme. Consider now the capacity region C of Gaussian-p2p codes deﬁned in equation (1) of [10]. As seen in [10], however, C cannot be thought as the capacity region of p2p-capacity-achieving codes since it is possible to gain beneﬁt even without message splitting by coordination in K user case. This is why MAC-capacity-achieving codes are deﬁned in [10], and it turns out that C is the capacity region with MAC-capacity-achieving codes. Simply speaking, C can be thought as the capacity region with no coordination among transmitters and no message splitting at each transmitter which we are interested in, and we will call this region as capacity region of Gaussian-p2p codes.\nDue to symmetry, the symmetric rate is obtained by evalua- tion on one receiver. Let us consider receiver 1. Let S be some subset of {2, ..., K}, and let X S be the vector of transmitted signals X i such that i ∈ S, and R S be the corresponding vector of rates. Then, the symmetric rate ˜ C p2p sym with Gaussian- p2p codes is given as\nWe will show that the symmetric rate ˜ C p2p sym is the same as ˆ C p2p sym = max S=∅,{2,...,K} { ˜ C p2p sym, S }. This implies that the symmetric rate is achieved by decoding all interference messages or treating all interference messages as noise.\nWe now deﬁne four interference regimes for this channel. Noisy interference regime satisﬁes I(X 1 ; Y 1 ) > 1 K I(X 1 , ..., X K ; Y 1 ). Weak interference regime satisﬁes I(X 1 ; Y 1 ) ≤ 1 K I(X 1 , ..., X K ; Y 1 ) and I(X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 , ..., X K ) \t > \t I(X 2 ; Y 1 |X 1 , X 3 , ..., X K ).\nStrong interference regime satisﬁes 1 K I(X 1 , ..., X K ; Y 1 ) < I(X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 , ..., X K ) ≤ I(X 2 ; Y 1 |X 1 , X 3 , ..., X K ). Very\nstrong interference regime satisﬁes 1 K I(X 1 , ..., X K ; Y 1 ) ≥ I(X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 , ..., X K ). Note that we know the capacity for very strong interference regime.\nWe can characterize the symmetric rate of Gaussian-p2p codes for each regime.\nlog 2 (1 + KP ). We would still call the combined scheme of TDMA and Gaussian-p2p codes as \u201cp2p scheme\u201d as in Section II. To compare performance, we need to characterize the symmetric rate of the ETW scheme. Let be K k the set of every subset of {1, ..., K} with cardinality k. Using sub-optimal decoding mentioned in Section II, achievable region of the ETW scheme for 1 P < a is given as C K ET W =\n) } for K k \t ∈ \t K k with k \t ̸= K,\n, where R c i is the rate of user i\u2019s common message, and R p i is the rate of user i\u2019s private message. We will characterize the symmetric rate of the ETW scheme with sub-optimal decoding in closed form. Note that the symmetric rate of the ETW scheme for two user case is not characterized for strong interference regime in [3] because the p2p scheme achieves the capacity. In K user case, however, this is not the case.\nTheorem 5. The symmetric rate of the ETW scheme is given as\n− 1)(aP − 1) K + 1/a\n− 1)(aP − 1) + P − 1/a K + 1/a\n− 1/a K + 1/a\n− 1)(aP − 1) + P − 1/a K + 1/a\nAs in Section II, we would like to compare performances of the p2p scheme and the ETW scheme for weak interference regime. Unfortunately, complete analysis like in Section II is extremely difﬁcult for more than two users. Because of that, we will restrict our attention to K = 3 with the approximated symmetric rate. Let us deﬁne the approximated symmetric rates as\nBasically, \u2018+1\u2019 term inside log expression is dropped for all, and (K − 1)(aP − 1) of the second term of minimization in\n˜ C ET W sym is replaced with (K − 1)(P − 1/a) which is larger than original. Hence, we may think this as an ETW-favoring approximation. We now compare performances in terms of these approximated symmetric rates.\nThe above result shows that the trend is similar to two user case even with more than two users, although the result obtained here is weaker and more limited due to analytical difﬁculty. Note that the p2p scheme is not shown to achieve the capacity for strong interference regime unlike two user case. Hence, it would be worthwhile to compare performances in this regime, but we expect to see similar trend to two user case.\nIn this paper, we investigated performances of simple trans- mission schemes for interference channel. It turns out that very simple transmission scheme even without message splitting can be quite good. Although the TDMA scheme is mainly compared with the ETW scheme for weak interference regime, we should note that this was because the p2p scheme is already known to be capacity achieving for strong and very strong interference regimes with two users. In other words, it is important to have the receiver structure which is capable of decoding multiple messages for strong interference, but simple change in scheduling could be good enough at the transmitter.\ndue to space limitation, we can also characterize interference regimes and the sum rate of simple schemes for two user asymmetric case as can be seen in the full version [12] which possibly provides more insights for interference channel.\nPerformance of the p2p scheme in MIMO IC was investi- gated in [20] where the transmit signal covariance optimization is performed. It would be interesting to compare performance of this p2p scheme with that of GDOF optimal schemes in [4], [5]."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"V. R. Cadambe"},{"name":"S. A.
