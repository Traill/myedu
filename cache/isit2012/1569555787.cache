In particular, when the delay requirement of the system is less than the coherence time of the channel, Zheng and Tse showed in their seminal paper [2] that for the Rayleigh fading channel with STC, there exists a fundamen- tal tradeoff between the diversity gain and the multiplexing gain, referred to as the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT). The optimal DMT was also characterized with the assumption that the block length of the space-time block codes (STBC) of the scheme is at least n t + n r − 1, where n t and n r are the number of transmit and receive antennas, respectively. The ﬁrst explicit DMT-optimal STBC-scheme was presented in [3] for 2 transmit antennas and arbitrary number of receive antennas and subsequently, in another landmark paper [4], explicit DMT-optimal STBC-schemes consisting of both square (minimal-delay) and rectangular STBCs from cyclic division algebras were presented for arbitrary values of n t and n r . In the same paper, for general STBC-schemes, a sufﬁcient criterion for achieving DMT- optimality was given which, for a class of STBC-schemes based on linear STBCs (LSTBCs) employing QAM and transmitting n t complex information symbols per channel use, translates to the non-vanishing determinant property\n(a term ﬁrst coined in [5]) being sufﬁcient for DMT- optimality. It was later shown in [6] that the DMT-optimal STBC-schemes constructed in [4] are also approximately universal for arbitrary number of receive antennas. Several other STBC-schemes with NVD have been proposed - for example, see [7], [8], [9] and references therein.\nThere exist several LSTBCs which transmit less than n t independent complex symbols per channel use, and STBC-schemes consisting of these LSTBCs have neither been reported to have the NVD property (although they do have the NVD property which is shown in this paper), nor have been claimed to be DMT-optimal in literature. Examples of such LSTBCs are the full-diversity Quasi- orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) [10], STBCs from co-ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs [11], four-group decodable STBCs [12], [13], which are all rate- 1 STBCs 1 and are characterized by low ML-decoding complexity. For these LSTBC-schemes, the sufﬁcient criterion provided in [4] for DMT-optimality, which requires that LSTBCs transmit n t independent complex symbols per channel use irrespective of the number of receive antennas, is not applicable. Hence, there is a clear need for obtaining a new DMT-criterion that can take into account LSTBC-schemes with NVD that are based on rate- p LSTBCs, p < n t .\nFurther, for asymmetric MIMO systems ( n r < n t ), the standard sphere decoder [14] cannot be used in entirety to decode rate- n t LSTBCs. It has been shown analyti- cally in [15] that the ﬁxed complexity sphere decoder [16], although provides quasi maximum-likelihood (ML) performance, helps achieve the same diversity order of ML- decoding with a worst case complexity of the order of M √ K , where M is the number of possibilities for each symbol and K is the dimension of the search, while an exhaustive ML-search would incur a complexity of the order of M K . In the same paper, it has also been shown that the gap between quasi ML-performance and the actual ML-performance approaches zero at high signal-to-noise ratio, independent of the constellation employed. Both the ﬁxed complexity sphere decoder and the standard sphere decoder can be used to decode at most rate- n min LSTBCs\n( n min = min(n t , n r )). This motivates one to investigate the DMT-optimality of rate- n min LSTBC-schemes (see Deﬁni- tion 4). In literature, only certain rate- n r LSTBC-schemes have been known to be DMT-optimal for asymmetric MIMO systems - the Alamouti code-scheme [17] for the 2 × 1 system [2], rate-1, diagonal LSTBC-schemes with NVD for any n t × 1 system [6], and rate-n r , rectangular LSTBC- schemes for n r = 2 and n r = n t − 1 [18].\n1) We present an enhanced criterion for DMT-optimality of general STBC-schemes. This criterion enables us to encompass all rate- n min LSTBC-schemes with NVD, which was not possible using the criterion in [4].\n2) In the context of LSTBCs, we show that STBC- schemes based on rate- n r LSTBCs whose real sym- bols take values from PAM constellations are DMT- optimal (for n r < n t ) if they have the NVD property.\n3) Finally, we show that some well known low ML-decoding complexity STBC-schemes are DMT- optimal for certain asymmetric MIMO systems (see Table I).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II deals with the system model and relevant deﬁnitions, Section III presents the main result of the paper - an enhanced sufﬁcient criterion for DMT-optimality of general STBC-schemes, and also presents a new criterion for DMT- optimality of LSTBC-schemes. A discussion on the DMT- optimality of several low ML-decoding complexity LSTBC- schemes is presented in Section IV.\nDue to space constraints, the proofs of several claims and other illustrative examples are provided in [20].\nNotations : Throughout the paper, bold, uppercase letters are used to denote matrices. For a complex matrix X, the Hermitian, the determinant and the Frobenius norm of X are denoted by X H , det(X) and X , respectively. The set of all real numbers, complex numbers and integers are denoted by R, C and Z, respectively. The real and the imaginary parts of a complex number x are denoted by x I and x Q , respectively, and |S| denotes the cardinality of the set S. f (x) . = x b implies that lim\n= b, and ˙ ≤, ˙≥, ˙>, ˙< are similarly deﬁned.\nWe consider an n t × n r MIMO system with perfect channel-state information at the receiver (CSIR) alone. The channel is assumed to be quasi-static with Rayleigh fading. The system model is\nwhere Y ∈ C n r ×T is the received signal matrix, X ∈ C n t ×T is the codeword matrix that is transmitted over a block of T channel uses, H ∈ C n r ×n t and N ∈ C n r ×T are respectively the channel matrix and the noise matrix with entries independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) com- plex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit\nvariance. The average signal-to-noise ratio at each receive antenna is denoted by SN R.\nDeﬁnition 1: (Space-time block code) A space-time block code (STBC) of block-length T for an n t transmit antenna MIMO system is a ﬁnite set of complex matrices belonging to C n t ×T .\nDeﬁnition 2: (STBC-scheme) An STBC-scheme X is de- ﬁned as a family of STBCs indexed by SN R, each STBC of block length T , so that X = {X (SNR)}, where the STBC X (SNR) \t {X i (SN R), i = 1, · · · , |X (SNR)|}\ncorresponds to a signal-to-noise ratio of SN R at each receive antenna.\nSo, at a signal-to-noise ratio of SN R, the codeword matrices of X (SNR) are transmitted over the channel. Assuming that all the codeword matrices of X (SNR) are equally likely to be transmitted, we have\nThe bit rate of transmission is (1/T ) log 2 |X (SNR)| bits per channel use. Henceforth in this paper, a codeword X i (SN R) ∈ X (SNR) is simply referred to as X i .\nAn STBC-scheme whose bit rate of transmission in bits per channel use is R(SN R) = (1/T ) log 2 |X (SNR)| has a multiplexing gain r if\nDenoting the probability of codeword error of X (SNR) by P e (SN R), the diversity gain d(r) of the STBC-scheme corresponding to a multiplexing gain of r is given by\nDeﬁnition 3: (Optimal DMT curve) [2] The optimal diversity-multiplexing gain curve d ∗ (r) that is achievable with any STBC-scheme for an n t × n r MIMO system is a piecewise-linear function connecting the points (k, d(k)), k = 0, 1, · · · , n min , where d(k) = (n t − k)(n r − k).\nTheorem 3 of [4], which provides a sufﬁcient criterion for DMT-optimality of an STBC-scheme, is rephrased here with its statement consistent with the terminology used in this paper.\nTheorem 1: [4] For a quasi-static n t ×n r MIMO channel with Rayleigh fading and perfect CSIR, an STBC-scheme X that satisﬁes (1) is DMT-optimal for any value of n r if for all possible pairs of distinct codewords X 1 , X 2 of X (SNR), the difference matrix X 1 − X 2 = ∆X = O is such that det(∆X∆X H ) ˙ ≥ SNR n t ( 1− r nt ).\nRelying on Theorem 1, an explicit construction method- ology was presented in [4] to obtain DMT-optimal LSTBC- schemes whose LSTBCs are minimal-delay ( T = n t ) and obtained from cyclic division algebras (CDA). All these\nLSTBCs have a symbol rate of n t complex symbols per channel use irrespective of the value of n r . However, Theorem 1 does not account for rate- p LSTBC-schemes, p < n t . In the following section, we present an enhanced DMT-criterion that brings within its scope all rate- n min LSTBC-schemes with NVD.\nWe present below the main result of our paper - an enhanced sufﬁcient criterion for the DMT-optimality of general STBC-schemes.\nTheorem 2: For a quasi-static n t × n r MIMO channel with Rayleigh fading and perfect CSIR, an STBC-scheme X that satisﬁes (1) is DMT-optimal for any value of n r if for all possible pairs of distinct codewords X 1 , X 2 of X (SNR), the difference matrix X 1 − X 2 = ∆X = O is such that,\nProof: The proof is omitted due to the lack of space. See [20, Section III].\nThe implication of Theorem 2 is that for asymmetric MIMO systems, it relaxes the requirement demanded by Theorem 1 on the minimum of the determinants of the codeword difference matrices of STBCs that the STBC- scheme consists of. The usefulness of Theorem 2 in the\ncontext of LSTBCs for asymmetric MIMO systems is shown in the following part of the paper.\nAn LSTBC X L , whose real symbols take values from a PAM constellation, is given by\nwhere A iI , A iQ are complex matrices, called weight matrices [11], associated with the real information symbols s iI and s iQ , respectively, and A M −PAM =\n2l − 1, l = − M 2 + 1, − M 2 + 2, · · · , M 2 , with ⌊x⌋ denoting the largest integer not greater than x. It is to be noted that {A iI , A iQ , i = 1, · · · , k} forms a linearly independent set over R. The symbol rate of the LSTBC given by (2) is k/T complex symbols per channel use.\nDeﬁnition 4: (LSTBC-scheme) A rate- k/T LSTBC- scheme X is a family of rate-k/T LSTBCs indexed by SN R, so that X = {X L (SN R)}, where X L (SN R) is\nof block length T and transmits k/T independent complex symbols per channel use.\nDeﬁnition 5: (Non-vanishing Determinant) An LSTBC- scheme X whose LSTBCs are given by X L (SN R) = {µX |X ∈ X U (SN R)}, with µ 2 . = SN R 1− r nmin and\n \ni = 1, 2, · · · , n min T, M . = SN R r 2nmin\n \nhas a non-vanishing determinant if for any distinct code- words X 1 and X 2 of X U (SN R), ∆X = X 1 − X 2 is such that det ∆X∆X H ≥ C, for a strictly positive constant C (independent of M and SN R) bounded away from 0.\nCorollary 1: An LSTBC-scheme X whose LSTBCs are given by X L (SN R) = {µX|X ∈ X U (SN R)}, with µ 2 . =\n \ni = 1, 2, · · · , n min T, M . = SN R r 2nmin\n \nis DMT optimal for the quasi-static Rayleigh fading n t × n r MIMO channel with CSIR if it has the non-vanishing determinant property.\nNote the difference between the above result and that of Theorem 2 of [4]. The latter result relies on STBC-schemes that are based on rate- n t LSTBCs irrespective of the values of n r , while our result only requires that the symbol rate of the LSTBCs of the LSTBC-scheme be min(n t , n r ) complex symbols per channel use which, together with NVD, guarantees DMT-optimality of the LSTBC-scheme. The usefulness of our result for asymmetric MIMO systems is discussed in the following section.\nRate- n t LSTBC-schemes with the NVD property are known to be DMT-optimal for arbitrary number of receive antennas. The methods to construct such LSTBC-schemes for arbitrary values of n t with minimal-delay ( T = n t ) have been proposed in [4], [9] and such constructions with additional properties have also been proposed for speciﬁc number of transmit antennas - the perfect code-schemes for 2, 3, 4 and 6 transmit antennas [8]. For the case n r < n t , Corollary 1 establishes that a rate- n r LSTBC- scheme with the NVD property achieves the optimal DMT and the LSTBCs of such a scheme can make use of the sphere decoder efﬁciently. Rate- n r LSTBC-schemes with NVD can be obtained directly from the rate- n t LSTBC- schemes with NVD as shown in the following corollary.\nCorollary 2: Consider a rate- n t LSTBC-scheme X with NVD, consisting of minimal-delay LSTBCs X (SNR) = {µX|X ∈ X U (SN R)}, with µ 2 . = SN R( 1− r nt ) and X U (SN R)\n \ni = 1, 2, · · · , n 2 t , M . = SN R r 2nt\n \nLet I ⊂ {1, 2, · · · , n 2 t }, with |I| = n t n r , where n r < n t . Then, the LSTBC-scheme X \u2032 consisting of\nLSTBCs X \u2032 (SN R) = {µX|X ∈ X \u2032 U (SN R)}, with µ 2 . = SN R( 1− r nr ) and X \u2032 U (SN R)\n \n \nis DMT-optimal for the n t × n r quasi-static MIMO channel with Rayleigh fading and CSIR.\nThe proof is a trivial application of Corollary 1 and the fact that X \u2032 also has the NVD property. As an example, consider the Golden code-scheme [5] X G = {X G (SN R)}, where X G (SN R)\n¯ α = 1 + jθ and α = 1 + j ¯ θ. It is known that X G is DMT- optimal for arbitrary values of n r . So, from Corollary 2, the LSTBC-scheme X \u2032 G = {X \u2032 G (SN R)}, where X \u2032 G (SN R)\nA. Full-diversity QOSTBC-scheme for the 4 × 1 MIMO system\nThe QOSTBC of [10], which is a rate- 1 LSTBC, is given by\nwhere A M 2 −QAM \t {a + jb, a, b ∈ A M −PAM } and e j π 4 A M 2 −QAM {e j π 4 (a + jb), a, b ∈ A M −PAM }. The QOSTBC has a minimum determinant of 256 [10] (i.e., |det (X i − X j ) | 2 ≥ 256, ∀X i , X j ∈ X Q , i = j), irrespective of the value of M . We note that (3) can be expressed as\nwhere A \u2032 iI = A iI , A \u2032 iQ = A iQ , i = 1, 2, and A \u2032 iI = (1/\niI +A iQ ), i = 3, 4. Since X Q has a minimum determinant of 256 that is invariant with respect to M , the QOSTBC-scheme has the NVD property and from Corollary 1, is DMT-optimal for the 4 × 1 MIMO system.\nA similar analysis reveals that the CIOD based STBC- schemes for 2×1 and 4×1 MIMO systems are DMT-optimal\nB. Four-group decodable STBC-schemes for n t × 1 MIMO systems\nFor the special case of n t being a power of 2, rate-1, 4-group decodable LSTBCs have been extensively studied in literature (see [12], [13] and references therein). For all these STBCs, the 2n t real symbols taking values from PAM constellations can be separated into four equal groups such that the symbols of each group can be decoded independently of the symbols of all the other groups. For these STBCs, the minimum determinant, irrespective of the size of the signal constellation, is given by [13]\nwhere d P,min is the minimum product distance in n t /2 real dimensions, which has been shown to be a constant bounded away from 0 in [22]. Hence, from Corollary 1, LSTBC- schemes consisting of these 4-group decodable STBCs are DMT-optimal for n t × 1 MIMO systems, with n t being a power of 2 .\nIn [21] a rate- 2 LSTBC was constructed for the 4 × 2 MIMO system and this code was conjectured to have a minimum determinant of 10.24 when the real symbols take values from regular M -PAM without regards to the value of M . An interesting property of this LSTBC is that it allows fast-decoding, meaning which, for ML-decoding the 16 real symbols (or 8 complex symbols) of the STBC using sphere decoding, it sufﬁces to use a 9 real-dimensional sphere decoder instead of a 16 real-dimensional one. We conjecture that the LSTBC-scheme based on this fast-decodable STBC has the NVD property and hence is DMT-optimal for the 4 × 2 MIMO system.\nSeveral rate- n r , fast-decodable STBCs have been con- structed in [19] for various asymmetric MIMO conﬁgura- tions - for example, for 4 ×2, 6×2, 6×3, 8×2, 8×3, 8×4 MIMO systems. For an n t × n r asymmetric MIMO system, these STBCs transmit a total of n t n r complex symbols in n t channel uses and with regards to ML-decoding, only an n t n r − n t 2 complex-dimensional sphere decoder is required, as against an n t n r complex-dimensional sphere decoder required for decoding general rate- n r LSTBCs. These STBCs are constructed from division algebra and the STBC-schemes based on these STBCs have the NVD property [19]. Hence, for an n t × n r asymmetric MIMO system, LSTBC-schemes consisting of these rate- n r fast- decodable STBCs are DMT-optimal.\nIn this paper, we have presented an enhanced sufﬁcient criterion for the DMT-optimality of STBC-schemes using which we have established the DMT-optimality of several low ML-decoding complexity LSTBC-schemes for certain\nasymmetric MIMO systems. However, obtaining a neces- sary and sufﬁcient condition for DMT-optimality of STBC- schemes is still an open problem."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"V. Tarokh"},{"name":"N. Seshadri"},{"name":"A. R.
