In [1], a transmission algorithm to achieve the capacity was proposed. In this algorithm, based on ACK/NAK feedback, the transmitter sends network coded packets. The receivers decode these packets by using the successfully decoded packets received previously. The network coded packets provide different information for different users simultaneously and hence increase rate. Nevertheless, due to the channel model (PEC), only the successfully decoded packets are used to retrieve information from the network coded packets.\nIn this work 1 , we extend the system so that not only successfully decoded packets are used during decoding, but also the packets that were not decodable. For this purpose, we change the channel model from a PEC with erasure probability \u2019 \u2019 to a Rayleigh fading channel with outage probability \u2019P out = \u2019, so that we can exploit the soft information of the received packets even if an outage occurs. We derive the packet reception rate region for our model and also extend the transmission algorithm given in [1] for the new channel model. The packet reception rate of a user is deﬁned as the number of successful packet transmissions over the total number of transmission attempts.\nThe capacity regions of broadcast channels are studied in [3] and [4]. The paper [5] shows that the capacity of a physically degraded channel cannot increase by using feedback, but the broadcast channel is not physically degraded in general. The capacity regions of broadcast PECs are studied in [1], [6], [7].\nIn [1], the main idea is to transform the broadcast channel into two physically degraded channels. The packet reception rate regions with feedback are given as\nwhere the A , B are the channel packet erasure probabilities, and AB is the probability that erasures occur over both channels. The packet reception rate region R f satisﬁes [1]:\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the broadcast system model is described. Section III presents a new packet reception rate region of the broadcast system. Section IV proposes a new transmission algorithm involving network coding on the physical layer. This new algorithm uses the soft information within the erroneously received packets in some prior time slots and it achieves rates that are close to an outer bound for the packet reception rate region in Section III. Simulation results are compared in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the work and proposes future work.\nConsider a Rayleigh block fading broadcast system with a single transmitter and two users. The transmitter has packets for user A and packets for user B, but no common packets. Uncoded packets are encoded to coded packets with packet length P L bits. The coded packets are broadcast in a unit time slot. At the end of each transmission, user i, i ∈ {A, B}, knows whether an outage occurs and informs the transmitter about the reception state Z i . Similarly as in [1] and [7], Z i = 1 if an outage occurs for user i, and Z i = 0 otherwise.\nThe channel between the transmitter and user i is modeled as y i = a i h i x + n i , where a i describes the pathloss and y i and x are vectors containing receive and transmit samples, respectively. Signal x has a transmit signal power E S . h i is an independent Rayleigh fading coefﬁcient (known to the receivers) with h i ∼ Rayleigh(σ 2 R ) and n i is a Gaussian noise vector with variance σ 2 n . The Rayleigh fading channel is both time-ﬂat and frequency-ﬂat and h i is constant on blocks of packet size. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is deﬁned as\nand the probability density function of the SNR is given by an exponential distribution\nWe present the packet reception rate region for our transmis- sion strategy, which is based on combining the soft information of the erroneously received packets. Before showing the result in Section III-B, the conversion of the channel models and the performance of signal combination in Rayleigh fading channels are examined.\nConsider transmitting with ﬁxed power and rate and a decoder with an SNR threshold of γ. For simplicity, the γ is a sharp threshold that distinguishes perfectly reliable and completely unreliable communication. The packet error rate (P ER) of the decoder with respect to γ i is thus\nFor comparison, we set the packet erasure probability i of the PEC equal to the outage probability of the Rayleigh fading channel on the packet layer via\n2) Combining Multiple Received Copies: A soft informa- tion combining scheme combines multiple received copies of the same transmitted signal weighted by the SNR. This scheme is similar to Chase combining in Hybrid-ARQ systems [8]. Retransmissions are performed if users feedback NAK messages. This scheme can be implemented by combining soft values of different received transmission attempts at the decoder.\nIn the following, we derive the expected number of trans- mission attempts until a packet is decoded correctly by user i (E i ) and by at least one of the two users in a broadcast system (E BC ).\nThe packet outage probability P n,i out at user i, i ∈ {A, B} when transmitting the same packet n times and using soft packet combining is [8]:\nSimilarly, the packet outage probability P n,BC out at both users when transmitting the same packet n times is\nLet P i n be the probability that a packet is transmitted n times until it is successful received by user i (by combining the multiple received copies in a single link with ACK/NAK feedback). For n = 1, we have\nFrom (7), (9) and (10), we can calculate the expected number of transmission attempts until a packet is decoded correctly as:\nSimilarly, from (8), the expected number of transmission attempts until at least one of the two users in a broadcast system receives a packet correctly is\nSimilar to [1], we transform the broadcast channel with feedback into two physically degraded channels. Consider a broadcast channel C and deﬁne a physically degraded channel C with Z 1 = Z A Z B of output 1 and Z 2 = Z A of output 2. For channel C, an outage to output 1 occurs only when outages to both outputs in channel C occur. From the deﬁnition of E BC and E i the packet reception rate at output 1 is 1/E BC and at output 2 is 1/E A . Deﬁne\nthen, similar to [1], the packet reception rate region R ∗ f of channel C with feedback equals to R ∗ 1 . Therefore, the packet reception rate region R ∗ f of channel C with feedback has a property R ∗ f ⊆ R ∗ f = R ∗ 1 . Reversing the roles of Z A and Z B , ﬁnally we have the achievable packet reception rate region (R SC ) for the system described in Section II:\nWe remark that this outer bound is not necessarily an outer bound of the underlying broadcast channel with feedback, but it does outer bound the packet reception rate region with our transmission strategy.\nThis section presents a transmission algorithm with soft decoding involving network coding applied on the physical layer. Before describing the algorithm in detail, we ﬁrst consider soft combining.\nA. Joint Log-likelihood Ratio Calculation with Network Cod- ing and Side Information\nConsider the soft information combination of three coded packets, P A , P B and P xor = P A ⊕ P B . If F enc is the encoding function for uncoded packet U with ﬁxed length U L, the output coded packet P with ﬁxed length P L satisﬁes P = F enc (U ). For our decoding algorithm, the encoding function F enc should be linear, like Turbo Codes. This means that, for a XORed packet P xor , we have\n(16) In the considered transmission algorithm, the soft informa-\ntion, i.e. log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of packets is calculated. The LLR L is deﬁned as:\n= 1|y) Pr(C j P\n∈ {0, 1} is the jth bit of the coded packet P k , k ∈ {A, B, xor}, 1 ≤ j ≤ P L.\nIn the following, we will present the method to extract the LLR of P A from the LLR of P xor , if packet P B is known and combine all LLRs of P A together. We take the boxplus operator from LLR algebra [9] 2 . The LLR L(C j P xor ) of a XORed packet P xor can be considered as a combination of P A and P B \u2019s LLR via\n \nFrom (18), (19), (20), we can convert the soft information of P xor to the soft information of P A , if P B is known. Then,\n) is the prior soft information about P A , we have a new joint LLR (L joint (C j P\nwhere L prior (C j P A ) and L(C j P xor ) can be the arithmetic sum of the soft values of multiple received copies.\nIf a user receives a XORed packet P xor and has full side information about one original packet P B , it is able to further increase the LLR of the other packet P A by calculating the LLR (21) jointly. The transmission algorithm, which will be introduced in the next section, is based on such a joint LLR calculation method.\nIn the following, we present the transmission algorithm with soft decoding. The transmitting strategy is similar to Algorithm III given in [1] and we repeat it for the sake of completeness. However, instead of discarding the erroneously received packets, the users use their soft information and calculate the LLR jointly.\nThere are two phases in the algorithm. During the ﬁrst phase, the transmitter broadcasts the packets of A and B. According to the feedback from the receivers, the transmitter knows which packets are received by which users correctly. If each user has a correctly received packet addressed to the other user and those packets are received erroneously at their actual destination, the transmitter generates XORed packets out of those two packets and multicasts them to both users. At the end of this phase, one user has received all the packets, which are addressed to that user. In the second phase, the transmitter only transmits remaining packets to the other user that has not received all the packets addressed to that user. The details of the two phases will be presented later.\nEach transmission attempt contains two steps. In the ﬁrst step, after informing the users about three control bits and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) bits, the transmitter broad- casts the coded packet with length P L bits. In the second step, the transmitter and users are all informed of the reception states of both users (ACK/NAK messages). The control bits, the CRC bits and the ACK/NAK messages are well protected as if transmitting through a perfect error-free channel. We assume that the number of those bits is neglectable compared to the packet length. These bits are set as follows:\n\u2022 Control bits b 0 , b 1 , b 2 indicate the phase (1 or 2), XOR operation (XORed or non-XORed) and destination (user A or B, if it is non-XORed) of the packet respectively (the same as Algorithm III given in [1]).\n\u2022 CRC bits are used for users to check whether they successfully decoded the packets.\n\u2022 Z i is a one bit ACK/NAK message of user i about its reception state. Z i = 1 means that an outage has occured and Z i = 0, otherwise. For simplicity, we deﬁne the states of feedback F = (Z A , Z B ) as:\nThere are three kinds of side information in this algorithm. The ﬁrst one is a correctly decoded packet addressed to the other user, similar to P B in (21). The second one is the soft information of the demanded packet before receiving a XORed packet, similar to L prior (C j P A ) in (21). Those two kinds are used for calculating the LLR jointly. The last kind is the soft information for combining multiple received copies. It helps to increase the effective SNR of the current transmission attempt at the decoder, if the same signal is transmitted multiple times. The following four kinds of buffers are needed for the transmission and each of them contains information about at most one packet.\nUncoded packet buffers Q A and Q B : Those buffers are used according to the feedback from the users. Q A is either empty or contains an uncoded packet addressed to user A. This packet is transmitted in some prior time slots, erroneously received by user A, but correctly received by user B. Q B is similar deﬁned by reversing the roles of A and B. These buffers are used to generate network coded packets. We deﬁne the buffer states S = (Q A , Q B ) as:\nwhere 1 means the buffer contains a packet and 0 means the buffer empty.\nReceiver Side: For user A (user B is similarly deﬁned by reversing the roles of A and B):\nUncoded packet buffer Q B : This buffer contains at most one uncoded packet addressed to user B, erroneously received by user B, but correctly received by user A. Before receiving a network coded packet, Q B stores the same uncoded packet as Q B .\nRetransmission LLR buffer Q Re : This buffer is used for combining multiple received copies. The soft information contained in it can help to increase the effective SNR of retransmissions at the decoder.\nSide Packet LLR buffer Q SP : This buffer contains the erro- neously received demanded packets\u2019 LLR values (L prior (C j P\n) in (21)). It is used for calculating LLR jointly and provides the erroneously received demanded packet\u2019s LLR value.\nAs mentioned above, there are two phases in the algorithm. For the operation of the algorithm, no prior or instantaneous information about channel is required at the transmitter. The actions of the transmitter and users in each phase are described as follows.\nThis phase runs until at least one of the users can receive all of its demanded packets.\nTransmitter: Transmitter takes different actions according to the buffer state S, the same as Algorithm III in [1]. Before transmitting the coded packet, it informs the users about the received packet\u2019s control bits and CRC bits. After getting the feedback from both users, the transmitter will inform the users about the reception state. Each packet is retransmitted until at least one of the users receives it.\n1) If S = S 00 or S 01 , transmitter sends out a coded packet P A = F enc (U A ) for user A.\n2) If S = S 10 , transmitter sends out a coded packet P B = F enc (U B ) for user B.\n3) If S = S 11 , transmitter sends out a XORed packet P xor = F enc (Q A ⊕ Q B ).\n(a) If F = F 00 , remove uncoded packets in Q A , Q B . (b) If F = F 10 , remove uncoded packet in Q B . (c) If F = F 01 , remove uncoded packet in Q A .\nUser A: User A takes different actions according to the received packet\u2019s control bits. The channel decoder\u2019s input, the LLR value, is calculated jointly. After decoding the packet, CRC bits are used to check the reception state and user A feedbacks this reception state.\n1) If the received packet is addressed to itself (P A ), the LLR values L(C j P\n)s of P A are the input of the channel decoder, where L(C j P\n)s are the sum of LLR values in the Q Re and received packet.\n(a) If F = F 00 or F 01 , Q Re is set to zero. (b) If F = F 10 , L(C j P\n)s are copied to Q SP , replacing any exist value. Q Re is set to zero.\n2) If the received packet is addressed to user B (P B ), the LLR values L(C j P\n)s of P B are the input of the channel decoder, where L(C j P\n)s are the sum of LLR values in the Q Re and received packet.\n(a) If F = F 00 or F 01 , U B of P B is copied to Q B , replacing any existing packets. Q Re is set to zero.\n(b) If F = F 10 , Q Re is set to zero. (c) If F = F 11 , L(C j P\n3) If the received packet is a XORed packet (P xor ), the new LLR values (L joint (C j P\n))s are the input of the channel decoder. L joint (C j P\n) is calculated according to (21). The C j P\n) is stored in the Q SP . The L(C j P xor ) is the sum of LLR values in the Q Re and current transmission attempt. Here, after getting U A , the CRC is performed on U A ⊕ U B .\n(a) If F = F 00 or F 01 , a packet addressed to user A is recovered. Q Re is set to zero.\n) is copied to Q SP . Q Re is set to zero.\nUser B: Similar actions as user A, with roles of A and B, F 10 and F 01 reversed.\nThe transmitter sends the remaining packets to a single user. This user applies the soft combining scheme of multiple received copies in this phase until all undelivered packets are received correctly.\nWe present simulation results and compare them with the theoretical bounds given in Section III and the result of [1] (which were based on a PEC model).\nIn order to fulﬁll the requirement (5), we choose Turbo codes as our channel code, since Turbo codes have very steep P ER vs SN R curves, which approximately gives (5). For our simulation, we take a UMTS Turbo encoder with packet length P L = 4500 bits and coding rate R = 1/3. We modulate the signal with BPSK. We choose γ = 0.34125, which we derived empirically from the simulations of a point-to-point communication with the Turbo code with given parameters.\nFig. 1 depicts the simulation results when using the trans- mission algorithm with soft decoding (Section IV-B), the Algorithm III in [1], the outer bound derived in (15), the broadcast PEC with feedback on the packet layer (3) and the naive time-sharing on the packet layer [1]. The packet erasure rates on the packet layer of the users are A = 0.45 and B = 0.55. Then according to (6), the parameters in the simulation are E S = 1, σ 2 n = 1/0.34125, σ 2 R = 1, a A = 0.9145 and a B = 0.7913 as in Section II.\nThe proposed transmission algorithm with soft decoding on the physical layer achieves the points close to the outer bound of the packet reception rate region given in (15) and has a much better performance than the algorithm on the packet layer in [1]. By exploiting the erroneously received packets\u2019 soft information, the required number of retransmissions is reduced and the packet reception rate region is extended signiﬁcantly.\nIn this work, the packet reception rate region of a broadcast system with Rayleigh fading channels is derived. By using soft information of erroneously received packets, the effective SNR at the decoder is increased and the transmission becomes more\nefﬁcient. Meanwhile, a new transmission algorithm with soft decoding involving network coding applied on the physical layer is proposed. The resulting transmission algorithm with soft decoding achieves rates close to the outer bound of the packet reception rate region. By comparing with the packet reception rate region on the packet layer without exploiting discarded soft information, the proposed algorithm shows a signiﬁcant performance improvement.\nIn this work, the transmission rate is not optimized for both users simultaneously. In our transmission algorithm with soft decoding, we use a ﬁxed transmission rate in each transmission. Hence, adaptive transmission rates schemes with incremental redundancy and soft information combining might give even better performance. This is an interesting direction to optimize the transmission rate for both users.\nThe authors are supported by the Space Agency of the German Aerospace Center and the Federal Ministry of Eco- nomics and Technology with the support code 50 YB 0905 and by the German Ministry of Education and Research in the framework of an Alexander von Humboldt-Professorship.
