This approach uses set partitioning so that \u201crelayed\u201d data selects a sparse subset while \u201clocal\u201d data selects the transmitted symbol from that subset. An outage probability analysis is presented that illustrates the advantage of this technique over the conventional time-sharing approach to cooperative diversity; for 16-QAM, coding gains range from 1.5 dB (for a spectral efﬁciency of η = 0.5 bits/symbol) to 3.2 dB (for η = 1.5). Then, a variation on this approach \u2013 in which codewords are spread out over multiple frames (and multiple channel realizations) \u2013 is examined and shown to provide a substantial gain at the cost of delay."},"body":{"text":"\u201cCooperative diversity\u201d is the term used to describe tech- niques through which multiple sources in a wireless network share their resources to achieve spatial diversity, thus ame- liorating the effects of multipath fading. Figure 1 shows a canonical example involving two partners, Node A and Node B, along with a common destination Node D. In this example, each partner acts as both a source \u2013 generating, encoding, and transmitting data that is \u201clocal\u201d to that node \u2013 and as a relay, (re-)transmitting, whenever possible, those data packets that originated at the other partner.\nAssume that transmission time is slotted, with Node A transmitting in the ﬁrst half of each time slot and Node B in the second half. When (for instance) Node A transmits, it must dedicate some of its resources to transmitting its own locally-generated data and some of its resources to relaying Node B\u2019s most recently transmitted data \u2013 assuming Node A was able to recover that data. There have been several approaches put forward for carrying out these dual roles. In [1] each partner splits its transmission time in half, transmitting ﬁrst only local data and then only relayed data \u2013 an approach we refer to as time-sharing. In contrast, both [2] and [3] use signal superposition, partitioning the transmitted power (but not the transmission time) between the two roles.\nAnother trend in cooperation is the integration of relaying and channel coding \u2013 what is referred to in [4] as coded\ncooperation. Variants of coded cooperation have included: algebraic superposition [5], in which the channel-encoded local and relayed bits are XORed prior to modulation and the relayed sequence is treated as a \u201cscrambling pattern\u201d at the partner; and trellis pruning [6], in which local and relayed data are multiplexed together prior to convolutional encoding, and the partner uses its knowledge of the relayed data to \u201cprune\u201d the trellis, deleting edges that are inconsistent with the known values. The approaches in [5] and [6] offer three to four dB of coding gain compared to the time sharing approach in [1].\nAll of the above references assume binary signaling. With regard to bandwidth-efﬁcient modulation, [7] uses the in-phase component of each QAM symbol to convey local data and the quadrature component to convey relayed data; of course, from the perspective of enhancing the partner-to-partner link, this approach \u201cwastes\u201d the quadrature component much like time-sharing \u201cwastes\u201d half of each partner\u2019s transmission time. Reference [8] overcomes this problem to some extent by using set-partition (SP) labeling [9], albeit for uncoded transmission.\nRecently, the authors [10] proposed the use of SP labeling in conjunction with low-density parity check (LDPC) codes in a bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) context for cooper- ative diversity. Other work on bandwidth-efﬁcient cooperation includes [11], which considers design issues for cooperative multiple trellis coded modulation (CMTCM) schemes, in which the signal constellation is asymmetric and multiple mappings are adopted among users. Most of the bandwidth- efﬁcient cooperation techniques in the literature ﬁt within the\nstructure of coded cooperation; examples of turbo coding, LDPC coding, lattice coding, etc. are summarized in [11].\nThis paper provides new insight into the LDPC-based cooperative system in [10]. It does this by developing outage probabilities that assume capacity-approaching codes on each link in the system and comparing those outage probabilities with ones obtained assuming more conventional (time-sharing) cooperation; this yields a more fundamental understanding of the beneﬁts of this approach than what is provided by the simulation results in [10]. This paper also shows how the approach proposed in [10] can be substantially improved by interleaving codewords across channel realizations.\nFor convenience, the system from [10] is reviewed in Section II, while Section III analyzes its outage behavior. Section IV describes and analyzes a technique by which additional interleaving provides additional performance (at the cost of delay), and Section V provides some conclusions.\nConsider the cooperative scenario in Figure 1. As noted above, we assume that transmission time is slotted, and during each time slot, Node A transmits for the ﬁrst half-slot followed by Node B during the second half-slot. All the channels are corrupted by independent, blockwise Rayleigh fading and complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with the same variance N 0 . Perfect channel information (i.e., the block fading factor and N 0 ) is available to each receiver, but not to either transmitter. Without loss of generality, we describe the operations of the transmitter at Node A, the receiver at Node B and the receiver at Node D, all during time slot t.\nAs a source, Node A generates k new local bits each time slot; designate this k-bit packet by i A L (t) ∈ {0, 1} k . On the other hand, whether or not Node A will serve as a relay during slot t depends on whether it has successfully decoded i B L (t −1); we assume that Node A is always able to determine whether it has successfully decoded i B L (t − 1) \u2013 something it can accomplish with high probability by checking the parity checks associated with the LDPC code described below.\nIf the packet i B L (t − 1) has been decoded successfully, Node A works in cooperative mode. In this case, i A L (t) and i A R (t) = i B L (t − 1) are encoded into C A L (t) and C A R (t), respectively, using the same systematic rate- R = k/n LDPC code. If 2 2m -QAM/PSK modulation is used, Node A then forms the transmitted bit sequence C A (t) by multiplexing C A L (t) and C A R (t): it takes, in turn, m bits from C A R (t) and m bits from C A L (t), thereby forming a sequence of 2n bits in which the ﬁrst m bits are from C A L (t), the second m bits are from C A R (t), the third m bits are from C A L (t), the fourth m bits are from C A R (t), etc. (Note this requires that m |n.)\nThese 2n bits are then transmitted using 2 2m -QAM/PSK modulation with a mapper based on set partitioning, as illus- trated in Figure 2(a) for m = 2 (16-QAM) and in Figure 2(b) for m = 3 (64-QAM). The m high-order bits (which, as a result of the multiplexer, are assigned to the relayed bits) partition the constellation into 2 m sparse subsets of size 2 m , and the m lower order bits (which are assigned to the local\nbits) select a particular signal point from the subset. The modulated result, i.e., the transmitted frame consisting of n/m QAM symbols, is called s A (t). This encoding-multiplexing- modulating process can be generalized to 2 2m+1 -QAM/PSK modulation as well, using 4-dimensional signaling [10].\nOn the other hand, if i B L (t − 1) has not been decoded successfully, Node A works in non-cooperative mode. In this case, only i A L (t) is encoded using a systematic LDPC code of rate R/2 = k/2n to generate the 2n-bit C A (t) = C A L (t). (We refer to the rate- R/2 code as the \u201clow-rate\u201d code in contrast to the \u201chigh-rate\u201d code used in cooperative mode.) The modulator in this case adopts the conventional Gray labeling and generates the n/m QAM symbols s A (t) from C A (t) = C A L (t).\nThus, in each frame, a k-bit packet of local bits is repre- sented with n/m QAM symbols, so the spectral efﬁciency is η = k/(n/m) = Rm bits per QAM symbol.\nWhen Node B attempts to decode i A L (t), it must ﬁrst determine the transmission mode of Node A; we assume that this side information is available. 1 If s A (t) contains both i A L (t) and i B L (t − 1), then Node B\u2019s knowledge of i B L (t − 1) enables the receiver to initialize the LDPC decoder based on sparse sub-constellations with larger minimum spacing, and these more reliable bit-wise soft values result in a higher probability of decoding success.\nWith regard to the destination: Node D estimates i A L (t) from s A (t) and (potentially) s B (t) \u2013 i.e., the frames transmitted by Node A and Node B during time slot t \u2013 and how it does so depends on which of those two frames contain (or do not contain) relayed data. Speciﬁcally, there are four possible states in which i A L (t) will be decoded:\n1) State S 0 : s A (t) contains i A L (t) but not i B L (t − 1), and s B (t) contains i B L (t) but not i A L (t).\n2) State S 1 : s A (t) contains i A L (t) but not i B L (t − 1), and s B (t) contains both i B L (t) and i A L (t).\n3) State S 2 : s A (t) contains both i A L (t) and i B L (t − 1), and s B (t) contains i B L (t) but not i A L (t).\n4) State S 3 : s A (t) contains both i A L (t) and i B L (t − 1), and s B (t) contains both i B L (t) and i A L (t).\nDetails of the decoding algorithm at Node D are provided in [10]. However, two relevant points:\n1) Cooperative diversity is available in states S 1 and S 3 and can be exploited during the initialization of the LDPC decoder via maximal ratio combining (MRC): soft values for the same bit (one \u201clocal copy\u201d and one \u201crelayed copy\u201d) are added directly, so that more robust initialization is obtained.\n2) The power of the SP labeling can be exploited in state S 2 and S 3 . If i B L (t −1) has been successfully decoded in the last decoding round, then Node D is able to demodulate C A L (t) more reliably since C A R (t) is already known.\nThis section analyzes the outage behavior of the SP-BICM system from Section II; that is, we assume that capacity- achieving channel codes are used on each link and determine the probability that the channel realizations are insufﬁcient to deliver reliable information to the destination.\nAn \u201coutage\u201d occurs over a particular link when the realized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) does not provide enough capacity to convey information at the required rate; a system outage occurs when one or more link outages combine to prevent the reliable recovery of a packet at the destination. To this end, we describe the various outage events that, taken together, characterize the system outage performance. (We use 16-QAM modulation as the exemplar, but the same approach can be employed with any constellation with 2 2m symbols or \u2013 using the techniques from [10] \u2013 with 2 2m+1 symbols.)\nEach partner conveys information to the other partner in either cooperative or non-cooperative mode; if the transmit- ted frame is sent in non-cooperative mode, then the outage probability is given by\nHere, η is the desired spectral efﬁciency and C 16QAM (γ S → R ) is the capacity of the 16-QAM constellation with a (randomly generated) source-to-relay SNR of γ S → R . If the transmitted frame is sent in cooperative mode, because the relayed bits are known to the partner, the outage probability is given by\nHere, \u201cFH\u201d refers to the sub-constellation that is obtained when the two high-order bits in each label \u2013 drawn from the relayed codeword, and thus known to the partner \u2013 are ﬁxed. (So \u201cFH\u201d refers to \u201cﬁxed high-order\u201d.) There are (for 16-QAM) four such subsets, each containing four symbols; however, they are shifted versions of one another and have the same capacity.\nThe outage at the destination is the system outage; an inability to recover a packet at the destination means the packet is lost. The destination\u2019s outage probability depends on the state in which the destination\u2019s receiver is operating \u2013 and that state, in turn, depends on the outages that occurred in the associated partner-to-partner transmission.\nRecall that there are four possible states in which Node D can operate:\n1) State S 0 : In state S 0 there is no relayed version of the data available, and the frame transmitted from the source node was transmitted in non-cooperative mode using a low- rate code. Thus the outage probability is given by\nwhere γ S → D is the (randomly generated) SNR on the source- to-destination link.\n2) State S 1 : In state S 1 the frame from the source is sent in non-cooperative mode (using a low-rate code); moreover, that same data is also relayed by the partner operating in cooperative mode (using a high-rate code). Both frames are used for decoding. Let R C = η/m denote the code rate used by the source in cooperative mode, and let R NC = R C /2 denote the code rate used in non-cooperative mode. Assume that both of the codes are systematic, as in [10].\nSo the k-bit data packet of interest is represented by two frames of QAM symbols. In the ﬁrst frame there are k/η QAM symbols, and they are all selected by the low-rate non- cooperative code; in the second frame there are also k/η QAM symbols, but only the two high-order bits of each symbol is selected by the high-rate cooperative code. (The two low-order bits are speciﬁed locally by the partner.) We assume in the following analysis that the two low-order bits of each QAM symbol in this second frame are known to the destination\u2019s decoder. This \u201cgenie-provided\u201d side information yields a lower bound on the outage probability, and it is side information that can be obtained in a number of ways, including \u201clooking ahead\u201d to future (reliable) frames and using the values therein to \u201cwork backwards\u201d [10].\nSummarizing, in state S 1 the destination\u2019s decoder has the following information available about the k-bit packet i A L (t):\n\u2022 Two (noisy) versions of i A L (t), both appearing in the systematic part of two different codewords. In the direct (source-to-destination) transmission the k bits of i A L (t) completely select k/2m different QAM symbols, while in the relay-to-destination transmission they select the m(= 2 for 16-QAM) high-order bits of k/m different QAM symbols.\n\u2022 One (noisy) version of the parities generated by the non- cooperative encoder, transmitted using 16-QAM on the source-to-destination link.\n\u2022 One (noisy) version of the parities generated by the cooperative encoder, transmitted using the two high- order bits of the 16-QAM constellation on the relay-to- destination link.\nThe system is in outage if there is insufﬁcient SNR on the various links to support the decoding of i A L (t) from the information above. This yields an outage probability of\nIn the above, \u201cFL\u201d refers to the sub-constellations obtained by ﬁxing the genie-provided m low-order bits in each QAM label. (So \u201cFL\u201d = \u201cﬁxed low-order\u201d.) In the 16-QAM mapping shown in Figure 2(a), these sub-constellations take the form of 4-ary constellations restricted to one quadrant \u2013 e.g., if the two low order bits are \u201c11\u201d then the sub-constellation consists of the four symbols in the upper left quadrant. In the above, C FL (γ R → D ) refers to the capacity of this sub-constellation with an SNR equal to γ R → D . Similarly, C 16QAM FL, FL (γ S → D , γ R → D ) refers to a multidimensional signal- ing scheme in which the same message is conveyed on two parallel channels \u2013 on 16-QAM operating at an SNR of γ S → D and on the channel deﬁned by the two high-order bits in the labels of two consecutive 16-QAM symbols, both at an SNR\n3) State S 2 : In state S 2 , there is no help from the relay, and the frame from the source is sent in cooperative mode (using a high-rate code). In this case, the outage probability depends on whether the destination has been able to recover the previous packet \u2013 the one whose relayed version was sent concurrently with the packet being decoded. (Put in the notation of Section II: if the destination has already recovered i B L (t − 1), then it will decode i A L (t) from the sparse sub- constellations speciﬁed by C A R (t). Otherwise, it will decode i A L (t) from the full 16-QAM constellation.)\nSo if the relayed packet is known, the outage probability is given by\nIf the relayed packet is not known, then the destination must recover the packet from a single high-rate codeword transmitted in the two low-order bits of consecutive QAM symbols where the two high-order bits are unknown \u2013 e.g., for 16-QAM, there are four symbols that represent \u201c00\u201d in the two low-order bits, four symbols that represent \u201c01,\u201d, etc. We use the label \u201cUH\u201d (= \u201cunknown high-order) to designate this modulation scheme, and arrive at the outage probability\n4) State S 3 : Both the frame from the source node and the frame from the partner node are in cooperative mode, so the destination gets to observe noisy versions of two high- rate-codewords \u2013 the ﬁrst transmitted in the low-order bits of QAM symbols on the source-to-destination link and the second transmitted in the high-order bits of QAM symbols on the relay-to-destination link.\nWe assume, as before, that the low-order bits in the second frame are genie-provided; whether the high-order bits in the\nﬁrst frame are available depends on the outcome of the previous decoding round. If the previous decoding round was successful, then the outage probability is\nIf the previous decoding round was unsuccessful, then the outage probability is\nThe labels \u201cFH\u201d and \u201cUH\u201d refer, as before, to the status of the high-order bits: they are either ﬁxed (because they were decoded in the previous round) or they are unknown (because they were not). The label \u201cFL\u201d reﬂects the assumption that the low-order bits in the second frame are genie-provided and thus ﬁxed.\nGiven the derivations above, the outage performance of the SP-BICM system may be evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation; by sequentially generating a sequence of link SNR values and determining which outage events occur, the system outage probability can be determined.\nFigure 3 illustrates the outage probabilities for the 16-QAM system described above at three different spectral efﬁciencies \u2013 η = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 bits per QAM symbol. Also included are the analogous outage probabilities for the conventional time-sharing approach to cooperation. It is observed that the proposed approach enjoys a coding gain of approximately 1.5 dB (η = 0.5), 2.2 dB (η = 1.0) and 3.2 dB (η = 1.5) for an outage probability of 10 −2 .\nFigure 4 provides results for a ﬁxed spectral efﬁciency: η = 1.0 bits per 16-QAM symbol. These results compare outage probabilities with the frame error rates obtained using LDPC codes operating with k = 1000-bit packets. Also included are comparative results for time-sharing and for non-cooperative systems in which each partner never cooperates but rather consistently uses a low-rate code with Gray mapping.\nThe SP-BICM scheme described and analyzed above trans- mits each codeword over a single channel realization; the diversity comes because two codewords representing the same data are transmitted \u2013 once as local data and the other as\nrelayed data \u2013 but each codeword \u201csees\u201d only a single channel realization. In this section we propose splitting codewords over multiple channel realizations; if this approach were taken to its logical extreme \u2013 in which each bit in every codeword is transmitted over a different channel realization \u2013 then the result would be the \u201ctrue\u201d bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) model considered by Caire et al. in [12].\nConsider the following revision to Node A\u2019s transmission during time slot t.\n\u2022 C A (t) \u2013 i.e., the multiplexed codeword(s) generated by Node A \u2013 is still modulated onto s A (t) which is now referred to as the codeword frame.\n\u2022 s A (t) is divided into d parts of equal length: s A (t, 1), s A (t, 2), . . . , s A (t, d); the component s A (t, i) is referred to as an \u201catom frame\u201d and will be transmitted in time slot t + i − 1. The parameter d is referred to as the frame division factor.\n\u2022 The actual transmitted frame s A trans (t) is the concatenation of the atom frames s A (t − d + 1, d), s A (t − d + 2, d − 1), . . . , s A (t, 1), which means that the transmission time of Node A is divided into d parts and \u201cshared\u201d by atom frames generated in successive time slots.\n\u2022 If C A (t) is generated in cooperative mode, C A R (t) is encoded from i B L (t − d), i.e., the decoding delay at the receiving partner is d time slots.\nAs a result, at high SNR, each codeword is likely to be transmitted to Node D over 2d i.i.d. channel realizations \u2013 d realizations as local data and d realizations as relayed data. Improvement of the system performance is obtained at the expense of decoding delay which is typically 2d time slots at Node D; fortunately, the performance gain is signiﬁcant even if d is relatively small. We refer to this modiﬁed system as the d-SP-BICM system. The original SP-BICM system is obviously a special case in which the frame division factor is d = 1.\nFigure 5 displays the simulation results for the d-SP-BICM approach, in which d varies from 1 (the SP-BICM system), to 2, 4 and 8. As expected, the diversity order increases as d increases, and the performance gain is signiﬁcant, for example, approximately 3.0 dB from d = 2 to d = 4 for a FER of 10 −2 .\nThis paper analyzes the outage behavior of a bandwidth- efﬁcient cooperative scheme recently proposed by the authors. This analysis afﬁrms earlier simulation results indicating that the proposed scheme has a signiﬁcant coding gain (i.e, up to 3.2 dB) compared to more conventional cooperation schemes based on time-sharing. Also included is a variation on this approach with signiﬁcant performance improvement at the expense of additional decoding delay at the destination node."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"J. N.
