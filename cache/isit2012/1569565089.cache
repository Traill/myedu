We use mixing time to character- ize temporal starvation, which is a transient phenomenon where links can starve for prolonged periods indeﬁnitely often despite having good stationary throughput. Considering a general CSMA network, we study a fundamental setting with multiple frequency agility, such that more than one frequency channel is available, and a link can transmit on at most one of the frequency channels not occupied by its neighbors. The characterization of throughput in such a setting is challenging, involving a hidden Markov chain of the associated stochastic process. This paper develops new results based on the mixing time of hidden Markov chains to shed light on the temporal starvation. Our analytical results quantify the effect of the number of frequency channels on temporal starvation.

While the stationary and long-term be- havior has been extensively investigated, recent studies have only begun to tackle the more practically relevant but also more difﬁcult problem of temporal and transient behavior in communication networks [3], [1], [5].\nIn this paper, we study a commonly observed performance issue in CSMA networks, namely temporal starvation. Tem- poral starvation is intrinsic in CSMA networks, which refers to the phenomenon that links can starve for prolonged periods indeﬁnitely often despite having good stationary throughput. We characterize temporal starvation by the mixing time of the associated throughput process of CSMA networks. We are interested in how the availability of multiple frequency channels will help to alleviate temporal starvation.\nWe consider the general setting of CSMA networks with multiple frequency agility [8], in which more than one fre- quency channel is available, and a link can transmit on at most one of the frequency channels not occupied by its neighbors. Although the focus of this paper is on CSMA networks, multiple frequency agility is a basic framework for general distributed resource allocation mechanisms. For instance, a node can access a resource (e.g., a frequency channel) when it is locally detected to be idle and the operation is permitted by policy (e.g., not simultaneously accessing more than one channel). Our study provides a foundation to address the\ntransient behavior of general distributed resource allocation problems 1 .\nThe main goal of this paper is to understand and quantify the effect of the number of frequency channels on temporal starvation in general CSMA networks. We have several new contributions toward the analytical understanding of multiple frequency agility.\nFirst, we ﬁnd that the study of temporal starvation in multi- frequency CSMA must be done through a hidden Markov chain. This is in contrast to the single frequency scenario, where the temporal starvation is merely characterized by a straightforward Markov chain [3]. In particular, we study the mixing time of a hidden Markov chain considering the activeness of each link rather than the full channel state that not only includes the activeness of the link, but also which frequency it is using when it is active. We remark that the mixing time of hidden Markov chains has not been well- studied before. Thus, our study not only yields new insights on CSMA networks, but also new techniques for analyzing hidden Markov chains in general.\nSecond, we quantify the sufﬁcient conditions under which temporal starvation can be signiﬁcantly alleviated. While it is intuitive that having more channels can alleviate temporal starvation, this is true only when the number of channels is large enough. Our simulation suggests that the number of channels being greater than twice of the maximum degree of the conﬂict graph (i.e. q > 2∆) is a critical condition for temporal starvation to be substantially alleviated. We conﬁrm this observation by upper bounding mixing time for the cor- responding hidden Markov chain analytically. We remark that it is non-trivial to obtain the sufﬁcient conditions of q > 2∆ 2 .\nThird, we show that temporal starvation can be severe if there is insufﬁcient number of channels. We generalize Cheeger\u2019s inequality in the context of hidden Markov chains to\nestablish a necessary condition for fast mixing. This necessary condition is on the number of channels. Violating the condition will lead to serious temporal starvation. In particular, we show that if q << ∆, mixing time for the hidden Markov chain scales exponentially with the number of links under a complete bipartite graph.\n\u2022 New tools to upper- and lower- bound the mixing time of hidden Markov chains.\n\u2022 Sufﬁcient conditions for fast mixing when the number of channel is sufﬁcient.\n\u2022 An example of slow mixing time when the number of channels is insufﬁcient.\nWe believe our results add to fundamental understanding of temporal starvation in CSMA networks and the extent to which multi-channel agility may help alleviate it.\nBefore presenting our analytical results, we brieﬂy provide some motivating observations from simulation 3 (see Fig. 1).\nWe simulate CSMA with multiple frequency agility on a simple 4×4 torus network (i.e., a boundaryless 2D grid). Note that the detailed CSMA model will be introduced next. We test under different numbers of channels and present the data of temporal starvation at 4 different time points (i.e. t = 100, 500, 1000, 2000). We observe that temporal starvation (measured by the throughput loss as compared to stationary throughput) is signiﬁcantly reduced, when the number of channels is larger than twice the maximum degree (i.e., 8). Moreover, we observe temporal starvation is severe when there is insufﬁcient number of channels.\nMotivated by these observations, we seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of these observations in the following sections.\nIn a CSMA network with multiple frequency agility, there are n physical links and q frequency channels. Each link has a set of neighboring links. A link can access a channel if and only if the channel is not occupied by its neighboring links, and the link is not using any other channels at the moment. We\nmodel such a network by a conﬂict graph G (V, E) where V is a set of physical links (each link is a pair of transmitter and receiver in CSMA network), and E is a set of relations representing whether two physical links are neighbors to each other. We let n |V |. For any v ∈ V , we denote by N (v) the set of its neighbors. Let ∆ be the maximum degree of the graph, ∆ max v∈V |N (v)|. We assume that all the links have unit capacities. But our results can be generalized to the case of heterogeneous link capacities.\nSimilar to standard CSMA protocol, we assume that each link maintains a backoff counter for each channel. The backoff value is generated according to an exponential distribution with a certain mean 1 µ\n. The link counts down all the q counters simultaneously at unit rate. When the value of a counter reaches zero, the link transmits on the correspond- ing channel for a duration that follows another exponential distribution with mean 1 µ\n. During the countdown process, if a link senses a channel being occupied by its neighboring links, it will freeze the corresponding counter, which will be resumed after the channel is released.\nwhere x(v) ∈ C represents the channel state of v in CSMA network state x.\nWe can model the evolution of the states of CSMA network with multiple frequency agility by a continuous-time Markov chain (X t ) t≥0 with S as the sample space, which we call CSMA-MF. (X t ) t≥0 is a time-reversible Markov chain with stationary distribution as\nNote that (X t ) t≥0 not only captures if a link is transmitting, but also which channel it uses. For link throughput, however, we are only interested in whether the link is transmitting or not. Thus, the link throughput is characterized by a hidden Markov chain of the \u201clink-activeness\u201d on (X t ) t≥0 .\nFor a state x ∈ S, we deﬁne a mapping g[x] : S → {0, 1} n that maps a state of channels to a state of link-activeness:\ng[x](v) = 0, if x(v) = 0 1, if x(v) = 0\nThus, (g[X t ]) t≥0 deﬁnes a hidden Markov chain for the throughput process of CSMA-MF.\nLet B \t g[S] be the range of g. If (X t ) t≥0 converges, the hidden Markov chain (g[X t ]) t≥0 also converges to its\nTo characterize the transient behavior of CSMA-MF, we rely on the notion of mixing time. We review the background of mixing time in a general setting here.\nLet µ and ν be probability density functions deﬁned on a sample space Ω. The total variation distance between µ and ν is deﬁned by\nWe denote the worst case distance from stationarity for a continuous time Markov chain (X t ) t≥0 with stationary distribution π by\nDeﬁne a mapping ˜ g : Ω → ˜ Ω as a surjective mapping to a smaller sample space ˜ Ω. Similarly, we deﬁne the worst case distance that captures how far a hidden Markov chain (˜ g[X t ]) t≥0 evolves from its stationary state by\n(6) Based on the deﬁnitions of distances, mixing time that\ncaptures how fast a Markov chain or a hidden Markov chain converges to its stationary state distribution, is deﬁned by\nThis provides an immediate way to characterize the mixing time of a hidden Markov chain by that of a Markov chain. However, We remark that the mixing time of a hidden Markov chain can be signiﬁcantly different from that of the underlying Markov chain [6]. Thus it is necessary to directly characterize the mixing time of a hidden Markov chains to obtain accurate characterization.\nAfter introducing mixing time in a general setting, we take Ω = S be the set of all feasible states of the CSMA network, {X t } be the Markov chain CSMA-MF and ˜ g = g be the link activeness map in this study.\nA detrimental transient phenomenon is temporal starvation, where links can starve for prolonged periods indeﬁnitely often. To characterize temporal starvation, we deﬁne some notations.\nDeﬁne the temporal throughput of link v at time t, starting at initial state x 0 ∈ S, as\nNote that as the hidden Markov chain converges to its sta- tionary state distribution, the instantaneous throughput A t x 0 (v) converges to the stationary throughput T(v).\nWe now deﬁne a measure of temporal starvation at v within interval t starting with initial state x 0 by the maximum temporal throughput loss , deﬁned by\n1 t\nwhere [x] + = max(x, 0). (t) is a natural measure, which counts the loss from the cumulative throughput a link will receive when starting at a particular state within a certain interval, as compared to the stationary throughput.\nHence, if we can characterize t HM ( ), we can provide bounds on temporal starvation of CSMA-MF. In simulation studies, we usually observe that the regions of fast mixing time imply that of low temporal starvation (e.g., as corroborated in Sec. I-A)\nAfter relating temporal starvation to mixing time (as a tool to understand the simulation results in Sec. I-A), we seek to characterize fast mixing time for the throughput process of CSMA-MF in the rest of the paper.\nIn the literature of mixing time [7], fast mixing usually refers to mixing time being polynomial in terms of n, and of- tenly, it is O n r (ln n−ln ) . Thus, our goal is to characterize the regions of tuple (q, λ) for fast mixing time. Speciﬁcally, we use the superscript csma to denote the mixing time for CSMA- MF. For example, let the mixing time for the throughput process of CSMA-MF be t csma HM ( ). We aim at ﬁnding the sufﬁcient conditions that\nThe sufﬁcient conditions for fast mixing of CSMA-MF is summarized in Table I. One can see from Table I region 2 to 4 that fast mixing is guaranteed 4 for q > 2∆, λ > 1 .\nWe establish these sufﬁcient conditions by ﬁrst uniformiz- ing the CSMA-MF (Section III) and then analyzing the discrete time CSMA-MF through a modiﬁed approach for path coupling(Section IV-A) and reduction to another Markov chain(Section IV-B). Finally, we end with an example of slow mixing when the number of channels is not sufﬁcient(Section V).\nWe uniformize CSMA-MF to discrete-time CSMA-MF by taking ν = n(qµ cd + µ tx ) as the uniformization constant. Equivalently, discrete-time CSMA-MF {X k } is a Glauber dynamics, whose state transitions from X k to X k+1 proceed as follows. Note that A(X k , v) is the set of available channels at node v.\n2) The new state X k+1 agrees everywhere with X k except possibly at v. X k+1 (v) = ˜ c is updated with probability p ˜ c as follows.\n  \n0 \t otherwise b) If X k (v) = 0, we set\n  \nif ˜ c = X k (v) 0 \t otherwise\nWith notation of having ¯ (·) as the discrete-time quantity (e.g. ¯ t HM ),we can relate continuous-time mixing time and discrete-time mixing time as follows.\nLemma 2. [6] If ¯ t HM ( 2 ) ≤ k , then t HM ( ) ≤ kc ν , where c is a constant satisfying c e c−1 ≤ 2 and c ≥ 1.\nPath coupling is a useful technique to upper bound mixing time of Markov chains and thus to obtain sufﬁcient conditions for fast mixing. However, we study the hidden Markov chain\ninstead of the Markov chain. This requires a different approach of path coupling. Hence, we develop a modiﬁed approach of path coupling in order to obtain bounds for the mixing time of the throughput process of CSMA-MF.\n1) Coupling and its challenges: Given any two random variables X and Y , we are free to construct a joint random variable Z = (X, Y ) as long as the marginal probability distribution function in each coordinate in Z is equivalent to the original random variable X or Y . Such a construction is called a coupling, which provides a useful way to bound the total variation distance of two random variables.\nOne can consider one-step maximal coupling (a standard technique in path coupling to bound mixing time in random coloring literature[2]) for discrete-time CSMA-MF to bound ¯ t csma ( ). In particular, by applying such coupling, when λ <\n, we can show fast mixing for CSMA-MF in region 1 of Table I.\nNonetheless, when λ > 1 ∆ , one cannot obtain similar results [6] using the same method. Therefore, we develop a modiﬁed approach for path coupling to work on hidden Markov chain directly, and obtain fast mixing time for the throughput process of CSMA-MF when λ > 1 ∆ .\n2) Modiﬁed Approach for Path Coupling: First, we deﬁne the path metric (ρ) and a new modiﬁed path metric ( ˜ ρ) in terms of link activeness. For x, y ∈ S,\nWe present a new approach for path coupling to obtain the following results. Our approach utilizes the neighboring conﬁguration of links to construct a coupling between any two initial states.\nTheorem 1. [6] With q > 2∆, suppose that there are two Markov chains {X k } and {Y k } on S with the same transition probability, but with possibly different initial states distributions X 0 , Y 0 . If ∃α > 0, δ ≥ 0 such that the following two conditions are satisﬁed:\nfor any pair of X 0 , Y 0 differing at only one link v ∈ V (i.e., X 0 (v) = Y 0 (v)) and either X 0 (v) = 0 or Y 0 (v) = 0.\nfor any pair of X 0 , Y 0 differing at only one link v ∈ V (i.e. X 0 (v) = Y 0 (v)) and both X 0 (v) = 0 and Y 0 (v) = 0.\nThen, for all (X k , Y k ) ∈ S 2 , there exists a coupling (X k+1 , Y k+1 ) such that\nTheorem 1 is speciﬁcally devised for hidden Markov chains. Furthermore, with an extra condition, we can derive an upper bound for the mixing time of hidden Markov chain {g[X k ]} as follows.\nCorollary 1. [6] Given a ﬁxed > 0, if the two conditions of Theorem 1 are satisﬁed and δ(∆+1)n α \t ≤ 2 , then\nα \t (21) Using Corollary 1, we can establish sufﬁcient conditions\nfor fast mixing of the throughput process of CSMA-MF, in the regions of large q and λ (i.e. region 2 and 3 in Table I).\nWe note that directly applying coupling or modiﬁed ap- proach of coupling on CSMA-MF cannot offer much insights for region 4 to 6 in Table I. Therefore, we use another approach. We relate the mixing time of CSMA-MF to that of the speciﬁc type of multi-color Glauber dynamics, denoted by ¯ t mcgd ( ) and show fast mixing of ¯ t mcgd ( ) in region 4 to 6.\nWe deﬁne a speciﬁc type of multi-color Glauber dynamics related to CSMA networks, whose state transitions from X k to X k+1 proceed as follows.\n2) The new state X k+1 agrees everywhere with X k except possibly at v. X k+1 (v) = ˜ c is updated with probability p ˜ c as follows.\n  \n \nBy suitably deﬁning a canonical path between these two Markov chains, one can show,\nTheorem 2. [6] On arbitrary conﬂict graph, if q > ∆ and λ > 1 , we have\n¯ t csma ( ) ≤ ¯ t mcgd ( ) 2λ 2 q(1 + λq) 1 + (q − ∆)λ\nTherefore, whenever multi-color Glauber dynamics has fast mixing time, CSMA-MF also has fast mixing time. In [6], we characterize the sufﬁcient conditions for fast mixing time for multi-color Glauber dynamics by upper bounding ¯ t mcgd ( ).\nTo complete the story on characterizing the region for fast mixing time of ¯ t csma HM ( ), we also investigate the lower bound of mixing time to obtain necessary conditions for fast mixing of hidden Markov chains. We note that this study is non- trivial because we cannot use the mixing time of a Markov chain to obtain a lower bound for that of a hidden Markov chain.Therefore, we develop new tools, for examples, by gen- eralizing Cheeger\u2019s constant to establish lower bounds. Given H ⊂ g(S), with Q( ˜ A, ˜ B) \t x∈ ˜ A y∈ ˜ B π(x)P (x, y), we deﬁne the modiﬁed Cheeger\u2019s constant as\nπ(g −1 (H)) \t (23) We claim that the mixing time for the throughput process\nApplying this, one can show that for a complete bipartite conﬂict graph when λ > 1 and q << ∆, ¯ t csma HM ( 1 8 ) is exponential in n. Hence, this corroborates with our simulation results that temporal starvation can be severe if the number of frequency channels is insufﬁcient.\nWe study the effect of number of frequency channels on temporal starvation in general CSMA networks. We investigate this via mixing time analysis of a hidden Markov chain. This paper presents sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for fast mixing of the corresponding hidden Markov chain, which allows us to understand the simulation observations."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
