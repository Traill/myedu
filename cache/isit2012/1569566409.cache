In this paper, we focus on the photon-counting measurement and study the photon and dimensional efﬁciencies attainable with modulations over classical- and nonclassical-state alphabets. We ﬁrst review state- of-the-art coherent on-off-keying (OOK) and pulse-position mod- ulation (PPM) with a photon-counting measurement, illustrating its asymptotic inefﬁciency relative to the Holevo limit. Then we analyze two architectures that improve upon the dimensional versus photon efﬁciency tradeoff achievable with conventional OOK or PPM. We show that at high photon efﬁciency these architectures achieve an efﬁciency tradeoff that differs from the best possible tradeoff by only a constant factor. The ﬁrst architecture is a coherent-state transmitter that relies on feedback from the receiver to control the transmitted energy. The second architecture uses a single-photon number-state source."},"body":{"text":"We characterize the performance of optical communications systems by their efﬁciency in utilizing available resources to transmit information. The resources of interest are the transmitted power and the bandwidth occupancy, or, more generally, the number of dimensions (temporal, spatial, or polarization) occupied by the signal. Let ¯n denote the mean photon cost per channel use, D the dimensional cost per channel use (the number of dimensions required to span the collection of possible transmitted symbols per channel use), and C(¯ n, D) the channel capacity, the maximum rate of information transmission, in bits per channel use, under these constraints. We deﬁne the photon information efﬁciency (PIE) as\nand we denote the bound on the achievable pairs (i p , i d ) by c d = c d (i p ) = \t max\nThis paper studies the fundamental tradeoff between these two information efﬁciencies, with particular emphasis on the behavior of c d at high photon efﬁciency i p .\nSince electromagnetic waves are fundamentally governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, the maximum possible rate of reliable communication at optical wavelengths is ultimately limited by the Holevo capacity [1]. On a pure-loss channel without background radiation, the Holevo bound on achievable pairs (i p , i d ) can be written parametrically [2]:\ni p = i Hol p = g(¯n)/¯n c d = c Hol d = g(¯n)\nwhere g(¯ n) = (1 + ¯ n) log 2 (1+ ¯n)− ¯n log 2 (¯n). At high photon efﬁciency ( i p \t 1), the ultimate achievable information efﬁciency tradeoff is:\nThe Shannon capacities of optical systems using conven- tional modulation and receiver strategies are bounded away from the ultimate Holevo capacity. In other words, conven- tional systems cannot achieve the best possible tradeoff of c d versus i p . In this paper, we show how conventional systems us- ing on-off keying (OOK) or pulse-position modulation (PPM) together with a photon-counting receiver can be redesigned (in principle) to bridge some of the gap to the Holevo limit. One new strategy utilizes a coherent-state transmitter that relies on idealized, delayless, cost-free feedback from the receiver to the transmitter to shut off the transmitted pulse as soon as a single photon is detected. A second strategy uses a single- photon number state instead of a coherent state to represent an \u201con\u201d pulse in either OOK or PPM modulation. The latter architecture is sensitive to losses in the propagation path, and approaches the Holevo capacity only in the near ﬁeld when the transmitter-to-receiver coupling is high. The ﬁrst architecture can be regarded as a method to emulate the statistics of a single-photon number state at the receiver, while maintaining the propagation efﬁciency of coherent states.\nWe ﬁrst consider coherent-state OOK and PPM modulations paired with an ideal photon counting receiver. Implementations\nof these architectures have achieved the highest photon efﬁ- ciencies demonstrated to date. They also serve as a baseline for the systems that follow.\nThe on-off photon-counting channel is modeled as follows. In one slot of duration T seconds, we receive either a pulse with photon ﬂux equal to λ (expressed in units of photons/sec), or no pulse, i.e., a photon ﬂux equal to 0. With OOK modu- lation a given slot contains a nonzero pulse with probability p, and with M -ary PPM exactly one slot of each block of M slots contains a nonzero pulse. The mean photon cost ¯n per channel use is ¯n OOK = pλT for OOK and ¯n PPM = λT/M for M -ary PPM. In both cases, the photon ﬂux is incident on an ideal inﬁnite-bandwidth photon-counting photodetector, and the transmission bandwidth may be taken to be B = 1/T . The dimensional cost D of a channel use, the time-bandwidth product, is D OOK = D PPM = BT = 1.\nIn the absence of background, the output of the photode- tector during a given slot time is a Poisson point process with rate either λ or 0. Since in this case detection of a single photon is sufﬁcient to unambiguously resolve whether a pulse was transmitted, the channel output may be classiﬁed into a binary outcome: either no detection event occurs or at least one detection event occurs. This produces a Z-channel for OOK, and an M -ary erasure channel for M -ary PPM. The Z-channel\u2019s crossover probability and the erasure channel\u2019s erasure probability are both given by e −λT = 1 − , where\nis deﬁned to be the probability that at least one photon is detected during time T given that the incident photon ﬂux is λ.\nThe photon and dimensional efﬁciencies for the OOK channel can be written succinctly as [3]\n(¯n ∗ ) − h 2 ( ) d( )\nd( ) = − ln(1 − ) = λT 1 − e −λT ¯n ∗ = p = ¯n OOK d( )\nFor large i p , there is an asymptotic expression [4] for the bound on achievable pairs (i p , i d ) that holds for both OOK and PPM:\nComparing this expression to the Holevo-optimal tradeoff, we see that at large i p :\nThus, conventional OOK and PPM both achieve a DIE that has suboptimal asymptotic dependence on PIE at large i p , relative to the Holevo-optimal tradeoff. The gap between the optimal DIE and that achieved by standard OOK or PPM grows linearly with increasing PIE.\nNext we consider a conceptual modiﬁcation to OOK or PPM systems that conventionally use coherent-state pulses. Since detection of a single photon in any slot is sufﬁcient to identify whether a pulse was transmitted in that slot, any additional detection events are wasted in the sense that they convey no additional information. Hence, if the transmitter knew the instant a photon were detected at the receiver, it could stop transmitting during the current slot time, thus reducing the photon cost with no change in the channel\u2019s capacity. An idealized receiver structure that performs this operation is illustrated in Fig. 1, in which the receiver provides delay- less and noise-free feedback to the transmitter, informing it to terminate the transmitted pulse as soon as the ﬁrst photon is detected. If no photons are detected, either because the vacuum state was transmitted or because an erasure event occurred, the receiver waits until the end of the T -second window and then restarts anew. We refer to such a system as OOK or PPM with single-photon shutoff , and we use the shorthand notation \u201c1S\u201d in referring to its variables in the following analysis.\nFor this architecture, the OOK or PPM channel is modeled by the same Z channel or erasure channel as that used for conventional pulses without early shutoff. The channel\u2019s crossover or erasure probability 1 − is unchanged in terms of the photon ﬂux λ, and the mutual information between input and output does not change as a function of λ. However, now the early transmitter shutoff reduces the average photon usage needed to communicate the same information. Whereas with conventional schemes the mean photon usage in a non- vacuum slot is λT , now it is λ¯ τ , where ¯ τ < T is the mean pulse duration within the slot before shutoff. The overall mean\nphoton usage ¯n, taking into account both vacuum and non- vacuum slots, is reduced by the same factor, for both OOK and PPM:\n¯τ T\nThis increase in photon efﬁciency does not come for free. First, the feedback channel requires additional resources, which are not accounted for here, but ignoring these costs might be appropriate for a link with very asymmetric forward and backward link capabilities. More fundamentally, there is increased bandwidth usage on the forward link, which results from the same shortened pulse durations that reduce the mean photon usage. Heuristically, the bandwidth usage is roughly 1/T if λT is small, such that pulses are hardly ever shut off before the end of a slot, and is roughly λ if λT is large, such that the mean pulse duration is roughly 1/λ. More generally, the bandwidth usage may be estimated as the reciprocal of the average duration of a pulse, ¯τ = T/d( ). With this deﬁnition 2 the number of temporal dimensions per channel use, i.e., the time-bandwidth product, is given by\nSince the corresponding time-bandwidth product for conven- tional OOK or PPM is D OOK = D PPM = 1, we see that the single-photon shutoff scheme increases bandwidth usage by the same factor d( ) by which mean photon usage is reduced.\nSince the channel models for OOK and PPM with single- photon shutoff are unchanged from their respective models with conventional pulses, the corresponding photon and di- mensional information efﬁciencies of the single-photon shutoff scheme increase or decrease by the same factors relative to the corresponding conventional scheme:\nThe photon and dimensional efﬁciencies for OOK with single- photon shutoff are computed explicitly in terms of and ¯n ∗ = p = ¯n OOK /d( ) = ¯ n OOK/1S . Note that and ¯n ∗ are the same quantities used in the previous section\u2019s expressions for conventional OOK, but now ¯n ∗ coincides with actual mean photon usage ¯n OOK/1S for OOK with single-photon shutoff.\nThe factor in square brackets is a function of but not of the photon efﬁciency i p . Hence the optimum is essentially independent of the photon efﬁciency when i p 1:\nThe optimal ∗ at high PIE corresponds to λT ≈ 2.087, implying that the optimal photon ﬂux in a pulsed slot would cost 2.087 photons if the transmission continued for the entire symbol duration T . The single-photon shutoff strategy reduces the mean photon cost in a pulsed slot to 0.876 at the expense of an increase in spectral occupancy by a factor of d( ∗ ) ≈ 2.383, and this trade nets a signiﬁcantly better DIE at high PIE. Conversely, at low PIE, the DIE achieved by OOK with single-photon shutoff is worse than that of conventional OOK. In this regime, the PIE-DIE tradeoff is hurt by the increase in bandwidth usage more than it is helped by the reduction in mean photon usage. The tradeoff is favorable only when the log-domain curve deﬁned by the pair of points (log 2 i p , log 2 i d ) has slope less than −1. Numerical evaluation of c OOK/1S d \t (i p ) is illustrated in Fig. 2, showing that OOK with single-photon shutoff yields better DIE than conventional OOK when PIE exceeds 2.22 bits/photon, and the improvement becomes signiﬁcant at higher PIE.\nThe information efﬁciencies for M -ary PPM with single photon shutoff are:\nIn this case, the factor in square brackets is maximized for ∗ ≈ 0.715, corresponding to λT ≈ 1.257, and resulting in a\nUnlike conventional OOK or PPM, the asymptotic dimen- sional efﬁciency of OOK or PPM with single-photon shutoff has the same parametric dependence as the optimal Holevo bound. The asymptotic DIE is inferior to the ultimate quantum limit by a constant multiplicative factor ( 0.274 for OOK or 0.150 for PPM), whereas the asymptotic DIE of conventional OOK or PPM is inferior to the ultimate quantum limit by a factor that increases linearly in i p .\nA single-mode ideal optical channel can be modeled as a beamsplitter of transmissivity η, where η represents the end- to-end efﬁciency with which the state is transmitted to the photodetector, including transmitter optical losses, diffraction loss and absorption, the receiver optical efﬁciency, and the photodetector quantum efﬁciency. In the limit η → 1, the Holevo capacity can be achieved by transmitting a number- state alphabet {|n : n = 0, 1, . . . } with a geometric probabil- ity distribution, and receiving the signal with an ideal photon- counting receiver [5]. In this paper, we analyze how closely this approach to the Holevo capacity can be maintained when we use only a binary alphabet {|0 , |1 } and allow η < 1.\nFor this scheme, the transmitter sends either the vacuum state |0 or the pure single-photon number state |1 . The single-photon number state is transmitted with probability p for OOK, and in exactly one of M successive channel uses for PPM. When the transmitter ﬁeld mode is in the vacuum state, then the output of the beamsplitter is also in a vacuum state. When the transmitter ﬁeld mode is in the single-photon number state, then the output ﬁeld mode is in a mixed state η |1 1| + (1 − η)|0 0|. Hence, an ideal photon counting photodetector yields the conditional output probabilities:\nFor OOK the channel reduces to a Z-channel with crossover probability 1 −η, and for M-ary PPM it is an erasure channel with erasure probability 1 − η. We denote variables pertaining to this architecture with the superscript \u201c1NS\u201d.\nThe Z-channel and erasure channel capacities are equivalent to those derived for their counterparts for coherent-state OOK and PPM with single-photon shutoff, with replaced by the channel transmissivity η. Furthermore, the average number of photons ¯n counted by the receiver is ¯n OOK/1NS = pη for OOK, or ¯n PPM/1NS = η/M for PPM, 3 which are the exact counterparts of the corresponding expressions for ¯n for OOK or PPM with single-photon shutoff, provided that is replaced by η. It follows that the photon and dimensional information\nefﬁciencies for number-state modulation are identical to their counterparts for coherent-state OOK or PPM with single- photon shutoff, but with the detection probability replaced by the channel transmissivity η.\nThe photon and dimensional efﬁciencies for OOK- modulated number states are given by:\nwhere now ¯n ∗ = pη = ¯n OOK/1NS (analogous to our previous deﬁnition of ¯n ∗ , but with η replacing ). At high photon efﬁciency ( i p 1), we have:\nFig. 3(a) illustrates dimensional efﬁciency versus photon efﬁ- ciency for OOK with number states for several values of η. Fig. 3(b) shows the variation of the asymptotic penalty factor 2 −h 2 ( η) , relative to the Holevo limit, as a function of η (solid curve). For small η, this is approximately η/e (red dashed line). From (1) and (2), we see that at η ≈ 0.534 (for which 2 −h 2 ( η) ≈ 0.274), OOK with number states achieves the same asymptote at high photon efﬁciency as OOK with single- photon shutoff. OOK with number states is always superior to conventional OOK using coherent states (with no early shutoff) at high enough PIE, but the crossover point moves to higher values of PIE as η degrades. If η = 0.1, this crossover point is at approximately 10 bits/photon.\nThe information efﬁciencies for number-state PPM are: i p = i PPM/1NS p \t = log 2 M\nHence, both OOK and PPM with single-photon number states achieve the same asymptotic dependence as the ultimate efﬁciency, except for constant penalty factors independent of i p . The asymptotic penalty factor for number-state PPM, η/e, equals that of number-state OOK in the small-η limit (red dashed line in Fig. 3(b)). Unlike the penalty factors for OOK and PPM with single-photon shutoff, the penalties for OOK and PPM with single-photon number states depend on another parameter, the channel transmissivity η.\nSince the efﬁciencies of the single-photon number-state modulations depend on the channel losses, we brieﬂy discuss the typical power coupling that can be achieved in a near- ﬁeld link geometry [6]. If soft Gaussian apertures are used at the transmitter and receiver, the Fresnel number product is D F = π 2 r 2 T r 2 R /(4λ 2 0 L 2 ), where λ 0 is the center wavelength, L is the propagation distance, and r T , r R are the e −1 ampli- tude attenuation radii of the transmitter and receiver apertures.\nThe normal-mode decomposition yields Laguerre-Gaussian or Hermite-Gaussian eigenfunctions, and there are m degenerate eigenvalues equal to η m = η m 0 for m = 1, 2, . . . , where\nEach eigenvalue represents the transmissivity η of the corre- sponding eigenfunction. As an example, a near-ﬁeld system with λ 0 = 1 µm, L = 1 km, and r T = r R = 0.1 m, has Fresnel number D F ≈ 247. For this case, the ﬁrst 55 eigenvalues are greater than 0.5, and the top 200 eigenvalues are greater than 0.28.\nState-of-the-art realization of high-PIE optical communica- tion is generalized OOK (implemented as high-order PPM) in conjunction with a photon-counting receiver. In the absence of\nbackground, the DIE achievable with this scheme is inferior to the Holevo limit by a factor that grows linearly with PIE. We investigated two methods to improve the efﬁciencies achievable with a photon-counting receiver. Each signiﬁcantly improves on conventional OOK or PPM at large PIE and achieves the same parametric dependence as the Holevo limit, such that the degradation relative to the Holevo limit is a constant factor at large PIE. However, each scheme requires assumptions that make a practical implementation challenging.\nOur ﬁrst approach, OOK or PPM with single-photon shut- off, is conceptual and not at all practical. As presented, it requires a perfect feedback channel with no latency, and, moreover, we assess no cost to the feedback channel. However, its impracticality should not overshadow a fundamental insight offered by this architecture: the asymptotic suboptimality of conventional OOK or PPM with photon-counting is essentially due to continued energy transmission that does not contribute to information transfer after the ﬁrst photon is detected at the receiver. If the transmitter could shut itself off (via either ideal feedback or an oracle) at the instant when the receiver detects the ﬁrst photon in a slot, the energy conserved from shutting off the transmitter is sufﬁcient to achieve a DIE which is suboptimal relative to the Holevo limit by only a constant factor at high PIE ( 0.274 for OOK or 0.150 for PPM).\nOur second approach requires us to transmit number states, {|0 , |1 }, rather than coherent states. This architecture inher- ently pushes the complexity to the transmitter by requiring on- demand generation of a (nonclassical) single-photon number state in a deﬁned spatiotemporal and polarization mode, in addition to requiring efﬁcient transfer of this state from the transmitter to the receiver. Single-photon number-state gener- ation is an area of active research [7]. If such a source were available, the DIE would be suboptimal by only a constant factor, in this case 2 −h 2 ( η) for OOK or η/e for PPM. This factor now depends on the end-to-end efﬁciency, η, with which the number state is transmitted to the photodetector. Achieving a reasonable transmission efﬁciency is not trivial, but may become feasible with improving device technologies."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M. A. Nielse"},{"name":"I. L.
