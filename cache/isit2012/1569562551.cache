The most fundamental criterion to evaluate the performance of variable-length codes is the average codeword length. The overﬂow probability of codeword length is one of other criteria, which denotes the probability of codeword length per symbol being above a threshold R > 0. The overﬂow probability has been investigated in several contexts. Merhav [1] has determined the optimal exponent of the overﬂow probability given R for uniﬁlar sources.\nOn the other hand, as is well known, if we impose unequal costs on code symbols, we have to consider the codeword cost, instead of codeword length. The average codeword cost, which is a generalization of the average codeword length, have been ﬁrst analyzed by Shannon [3]. Karp [4] has given the variable- length code, which minimizes the average codeword cost. The inﬁmum of the average codeword cost has been determined by Krause [5] for i.i.d. sources and extended to general sources by Han and Uchida [6]. Among others, Uchida and Han [2] have proposed the overﬂow probability of codeword cost. They have considered the overﬂow probability as the probability of codeword cost per symbol being above a threshold. Then, they have shown the inﬁmum of achievable threshold, where achievable threshold means that there exists a code whose overﬂow probability of codeword cost decreases with given exponent r.\nIn this paper, we also deal with the overﬂow probability of codeword cost. In particular, we consider the ε-achievable\nthreshold, which means that there exists a variable-length code, whose overﬂow probability is smaller than or equal to ε. Then, we ﬁrst determine the inﬁmum of ε-achievable threshold for general sources. Next, we consider the second- order achievable threshold for general sources. The ﬁner evaluation of the achievable rates, called the second-order achievable rates, have been analyzed in several contexts [7]\u2013 [10]. Analogously to these settings, we deﬁne the second-order achievable threshold on the overﬂow probability and derive the inﬁmum of the second-order achievable threshold. Nomura and Matsushima [11] have ﬁrst derived this quantity in the case that the cost function is assumed to be memoryless. In this paper, we treat the conditional cost function to generalize this result. As a result, the similar analysis with [11], which is on the basis of the information-spectrum methods, is also efﬁcient in this case. These results show that the information- spectrum methods are still effective in analyses of the overﬂow probability in variable-length coding problem.\nof n-dimensional random variables X n , where each compo- nent random variable X (n) i takes values in a countable set X .\nThe variable-length codes are characterized as follows. Let ϕ n : X n → U ∗ , ψ n : {ϕ n (x) } x ∈X n → X n ,\nbe a variable-length encoder and a decoder, respectively, where U = {1, 2, · · · , K} is called the code alphabet and U ∗ is the set of all ﬁnite-length strings over U excluding the null string.\nWe consider the situation that there are unequal costs on code symbols. Let us deﬁne the cost function c : U ∗ → (0, + ∞) considered in this paper. The cost c(u l ) of a sequence u l ∈ U l is deﬁned by\nwhere c(u i |u i −1 1 ) is a conditional cost of u i given u i −1 1 such that 0 < c(u i |u i −1 1 ) < ∞ (∀i,∀u i ∈ U,∀u i −1 1 ∈ U i −1 ). The conditional cost capacity α c (u i −1 1 ) given u i −1 1 is deﬁned by the positive unique root α of the equation ∑\nIn this paper, we assume that the conditional cost capacity α c (u i −1 1 ) is independent on u i −1 1 , more exactly, α c (u i −1 1 ) = α holds for all u i −1 1 ∈ U i −1 .\nSuch a class of cost function has been ﬁrst considered in [12]. Han and Uchida [6] also have treated this type of cost function.We denote\nfor short. The variable-length codes considered in this paper, satisﬁes the preﬁx condition: ∑\nThe overﬂow probability of codeword length is deﬁned as follows:\nDeﬁnition 2.1: Given a threshold R, the overﬂow probabil- ity of the variable-length encoder ϕ n is deﬁned by\nIn this paper, we generalize the above overﬂow probability not only to the case for unequal costs on code symbols but also for ﬁner evaluation of the overﬂow probability. To this end, we consider the overﬂow probability of codeword cost as follows:\nDeﬁnition 2.2: Given some sequence {η n } ∞ n=1 , where 0 < η n < ∞ for each n = 1, 2, · · · , the overﬂow probability of the variable-length encoder ϕ n is deﬁned by\nSince {η n } ∞ n=1 is an arbitrary sequence, the above deﬁnition is general. In particular, we shall consider the following two types of overﬂow probability in this paper:\nRemark 2.1: If we set η n = nR for all n = 1, 2, · · · , the overﬂow probability can be written as\nThus, in the case that η n = nR, the overﬂow probability deﬁned by (3) means the probability that the codeword cost per symbol exceeds some constant R. This is a natural extension of the overﬂow probability of codeword length analyzed in [1] or [2] to the overﬂow probability of codeword cost.\nOn the other hand, the ﬁner evaluation of the achievable rates, called the second-order achievable rates, has been inves- tigated in several contexts [7]\u2013[10]. Analogously to their anal- yses, we evaluate the overﬂow probability in the second-order sense. To do so, we consider the second case: η n = na+L\nfor all n = 1, 2, · · · . Hereafter, if we consider the overﬂow probability in the case η n = na + L\norder overﬂow probability given a in this paper, while in the ﬁrst case it is called the ﬁrst-order overﬂow probability. The second-order overﬂow probability given a of variable-length encoder ϕ n with threshold L is written as\nIn the ﬁrst case, we are interested in the inﬁmum of threshold R that we can achieve.\nDeﬁnition 2.3: Given 0 ≤ ε < 1, R is called an ε- achievable threshold for the source if there exists a variable- length encoder ϕ n such that\nAlso, in the analysis of second-order overﬂow probability, we deﬁne the achievability:\nDeﬁnition 2.5: Given 0 ≤ ε < 1 and 0 < a < ∞, L is called an (ε, a)-achievable threshold for the source, if there exists a variable-length encoder ϕ n such that\nWe show two lemmas that have important roles to derive our main theorems. These lemmas are derived using the information-spectrum method and hence valid through the general source.\nLemma 3.1: For any general sources X and any sequence of positive number {η n } ∞ n=1 , there exists a variable-length encoder ϕ n that satisﬁes\nfor n = 1, 2, · · · , where {z n } ∞ n=1 is a given sequence of an arbitrary number satisfying z i > 0 for i = 1, 2, · · · and α c denotes the cost capacity deﬁned in (1).\nProof: We use the code proposed by Han and Uchida [6]. Then, from the property of the code, it holds that\nfor all n = 1, 2, · · · , where ϕ ∗ n denotes the encoder of the code. Furthermore, we set the decoder as the inverse mapping\nof ϕ ∗ n .Note that the code is a uniquely decodable code for general sources with countably inﬁnite source alphabet .\nNext, we shall evaluate the overﬂow probability of this code. Set\nε n (ϕ ∗ n , η n ) = Pr {X n ∈ S n } =\nwhere A c denotes the complement set of the set A. Since (4) holds, for ∀x ∈ S n , we have\nfor ∀x ∈ S n . Substituting the above inequality into (5), we have\nz n . Thus, we have\nbecause log 2 ≤ 1 holds. Therefore, we have proved the lemma.\nLemma 3.2: For any variable-length code and any sequence {η n } ∞ n=1 , it holds that\nfor n = 1, 2, · · · where {z n } ∞ n=1 is a given sequence of an arbitrary number satisfying z i > 0 for i = 1, 2, · · · .\nIn this section, we determine R(ε |X) for general sources. Before showing the theorem, we deﬁne the function F (R) as:\nThe following theorem is one of our main results: Theorem 4.1: For 0 ≤ ∀ε < 1, it holds that\nProof: The proof consists of two parts. (Direct Part) Let R 0 be as\nfor any γ > 0 by showing that R 0 is an ε-achievable overﬂow threshold for the source. Let η n be as η n = n(R 0 + γ), then\nfrom Lemma 3.1 there exists a variable-length encoder ϕ n that satisﬁes\nfor n = 1, 2, · · · . Notice that z n > 0 is an arbitrary number. Set z n = K −\nas n → ∞. Thus, since α c and c max are positive constants, by taking lim sup n →∞ , we have\nε n (ϕ n , nR 0 ) ≤lim sup\nHence, from the deﬁnition of R 0 we have lim sup\nTherefore, the direct part has been proved. (Converse Part)\nis an ε-achievable overﬂow threshold. Then we shall show a contradiction.\nLet η n be as η n = nR 1 . Then, from Lemma 3.2 for any sequence {z n } ∞ n=1 ( z i > 0 i = 1, 2, · · · ) and any variable- length encoder we have\nfor n = 1, 2, · · · . Thus, for any variable-length encoder it holds that for each n = 1, 2, · · ·\nSet z n = K −nγ , where γ > 0 is a small constant that satisﬁes R 1 + γ < inf {R |F (R) ≤ ε} . \t (13)\nSince we assume that (12) holds, it is obvious that there exists γ > 0 that satisﬁes the above inequality. Then, we have\nε n (ϕ n , nR 1 ) ≥ lim sup\nwhere the last inequality is derived from (13) and the deﬁnition of F (R). This is a contradiction and the converse part has been proved.\nRemark 4.1: In the analysis of ε-ﬁxed-length source coding for general sources, the function\nis used in the case that α c = 1 [13] (see, also [14, Theorem 1.6.1]). This suggests a deep relationship between the overﬂow probability of codeword length in variable-length coding and the error probability in ﬁxed-length coding. The similar rela- tionship in the second-order case is also clariﬁed by Theorem 5.1 in the following section and [8, Theorem 3].\nFrom the above theorem, we can show a corollary. Before describing the corollary, we deﬁne the spectral sup-entropy rate [14] 1 :\nThen, the following corollary holds. Corollary 4.1:\nSo far, we have considered the ﬁrst-order achievable thresh- old. In this section, we consider the second-order achievability. In the second-order case, the inﬁmum (ε, a)-achievable over- ﬂow threshold for general sources is also determined by using Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.2.\nWe deﬁne the function F a (R) given a as follows, which is correspondence with the function F (R) in the ﬁrst-order case.\nn ) − nα c a √\nProof: The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1. Hence, we omit the proof.\nThe above theorem is valid for general sources. Hence Theorem 5.1 is a quite general result. However, in general to compute the function L (ε, a |X) is hard. Next, we consider a simple case such as an i.i.d. source and we address the above quantity speciﬁcally.\nFor an i.i.d. source, from Corollary 4.1, we are interested in L\n. To specify this quantity for an i.i.d. source, we need to introduce the variance of self-information as follows:\nIn this paper, we assume that the above variance exists. Then, from Theorem 5.1 we obtain the following theorem.\nwhere Φ −1 denotes a inverse function of Φ and Φ(T ) is the Gaussian cumulative distribution function with mean 0 and variance 1, that is, Φ(T ) is given by\nn ) − nH(X) √ nα\nOn the other hand, since we consider the i.i.d. source, from the asymptotic normality (due to the central limit theorem) it holds that\nis a continuous function and monotoni- cally increases as L increases, we have\nWe have so far dealt with the overﬂow probability of variable-length coding with cost function for general sources. The overﬂow probability is important not only from the theo- retical viewpoint but also from the engineering point of view. However, there is few research on the overﬂow probability of variable-length coding for general sources, even though the equal cost function is assumed. Hence, our attempt to analyze the overﬂow probability is meaningful.\nWe have revealed that, as shown in the proofs of the present paper, the information-spectrum approach is substantial in the analysis of the overﬂow probability of variable-length coding with cost function. An application to more general cost function is a future work.\nFinally, as described in Remark 4.1 there is a deep relation- ship between the overﬂow probability of codeword length in variable-length coding and the error probability in ﬁxed-length coding. It is an interesting problem to consider the relation of the overﬂow probability of codeword cost to the ﬁxed-length coding."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"N.
