In this setting, computational complexity and rate- reliability performance are highly intertwined, in the sense that limitations to computational resources (commonly measured by ﬂoating point operations - ﬂops), bring about substantial degradation in the system performance. In the high rate setting of interest, the lion\u2019s share of computational costs is due to decoding algorithms, on which we here focus, speciﬁcally considering the broad family of ML-based and regularized (MMSE-preprocessed) lattice decoding algorithms.\na) Error and complexity exponents: In terms of relia- bility, the diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT, cf. [1]) has been extensively used to quantify the relationship between the rate, denoted as R, and the probability of error P err . In the high SNR regime (SNR will be henceforth denoted as ρ), this relationship was described in [1] using the high SNR measures of multiplexing gain r := R/ log ρ and diversity gain d(r) := − lim ρ→∞ log P err / log ρ. As a result the same work revealed, for the case of no feedback, the optimal DMT in the form of the maximum possible diversity gain d ∗ (r) for a given r.\nThe work in [2]\u2013[4] provided a similar treatment for complexity. Speciﬁcally for N max denoting the amount of computational reserves, in ﬂops per duration of one codeword, that the transceiver is endowed with 2 , the work in [2], [3] introduced the complexity exponent to take the form\nlog ρ , \t (1) where the value of the above exponent was derived as a function of the desired r and d(r). In the speciﬁc setting of\nquasi-static MIMO, without feedback and in the absence of lattice reduction techniques 3 , the above work revealed that to achieve the optimal DMT d ∗ (r), the complexity exponent is upper bounded by a piecewise linear function which, at integer r takes the form\nc(r) = r(n T − r). \t (2) This bound was shown to be tight for a broad range of practical settings, and it also revealed a complexity that scales exponentially with the number of codeword bits.\nThis very considerable complexity brought to the fore the need for methods that manage to achieve the same near- optimal performance, but do so with much reduced compu- tational resources.\nb) Feedback gains: In terms of feedback, the work in [5] utilized the DMT machinery to analyze the reliability gains of feedback, and to speciﬁcally show that an L-round ARQ scheme can provide for a much increased feedback-aided DMT which 4 was shown to take the form d ∗ (r/L).\nMotivated by the considerable magnitude of the complexity exponent in (2), we here seek to understand the role of feedback in reducing complexity, rather than in improving reliability. For this we seek to quantify the feedback-aided complexity exponent required to achieve the original d ∗ (r) in the presence of a modiﬁed version of the above mentioned L- round MIMO ARQ. Speciﬁcally we will derive upper bounds on the minimum 5 complexity exponent required by ML and regularized (MMSE-preprocessed) lattice based sphere de- coders (SD) to achieve the optimal DMT d ∗ (r) . We will focus on the family of minimum delay ARQ schemes (to be described later on). The derivations focus on ML-based decoding, but given the equivalence of ML and regularized lattice based decoding shown in [3], these same results extend automatically to the regularized lattice decoding case. We note that the validity of the presented bounds depends on the existence of actual schemes that meet them. These schemes will be here provided, together with the associated lattice designs, decoders, as well as halting and ordering polices.\nThe analysis and the constructed feedback schemes tell us how to properly utilize a single bit of feedback to alleviate the adverse effects of computational constraints, as those seen in the derived rate-reliability-complexity tradeoffs of [4].\nBefore proceeding to a brief description of the MIMO ARQ signaling, we quickly note that we here employ an ARQ variant which reduces the L-round scheme to a two-round scheme with uneven but ﬁxed durations, and we do so by disregarding all but the ﬁrst and last rounds. Such a scheme requires just one bit of feedback. We will however, for clarity of exposition, maintain use of the notation of the better known L-round scheme.\nWe here present the general n T ×n R MIMO-ARQ signaling setting, and focus on the details which are necessary for our exposition. For further understanding of the MIMO-ARQ channel, the reader is referred to [5] as well as [6].\nUnder ARQ signaling, each message is associated to a unique block [X 1 C X 2 C · · · X L C ] of signaling matrices, where each X i C ∈ C n T ×T , i = 1, · · · , L, corresponds to the n T × T matrix of signals sent during the ith round. The accumulated code matrix at the end of round , = 1, · · · , L, takes the form X ARQ, C \t = [X 1 C X 2 C · · · X C ] ∈ C n T × T . We note that the\nsignals X ARQ,L C \t are drawn from a lattice design that ensures unique decodability at every round 6 .\nIn the quasi-static case of interest, the received signal accumulated at the end of the -th round takes the form\nwhere H C ∈ C n R ×n T , where the scaling factor θ is chosen such that E( θX i C 2 ) ≤ ρT, 1 ≤ i ≤ .\nWe proceed with quantifying the complexity reductions due to ARQ feedback.\nWe here seek to analyze the complexity reductions due to MIMO ARQ feedback. Speciﬁcally for d ∗ (r) denoting the optimal DMT of the n T × n R MIMO channel in the absence of feedback, we here seek to describe the feedback-aided complexity exponent required to meet the same d ∗ (r) with the assistance now of an L-round ARQ scheme. As stated before, our analysis focuses on the setting of L ≤ n T and of minimum-delay ARQ schemes , corresponding to T = 1. The derived exponent is to be compared with the exponent in (2) (cf. [2, Theorem 6] and [3, Corollary 1b]) corresponding to no feedback. The following holds for the n T × n R (n R ≥ n T ), i.i.d. regular fading 7 MIMO channel.\nTheorem 1: Let c(r) be the minimum complexity exponent required to achieve d ∗ (r), minimized over all lattice designs, all ARQ schemes with L ≤ n T rounds of ARQ, all halting\npolicies and all decoding order policies. Then c(r) ≤ c red (r) where\nwhich is a piecewise linear function that, for integer r, takes the form\nThe proof of the above theorem will be presented in Appendix A, together with the proofs for the upcoming Propositions 1 and 2, and it will include the derivation of the upper bound, and the constructive achievement of this bound which is presented in Propositions 1, 2. The constructive part of the proof is based on designing ARQ schemes and implementations (lattice designs and halting policies) that meet the bound. We proceed with these propositions where we identify cases for which the above complexity bound sufﬁces to achieve d ∗ (r) with the help of feedback.\nAn important aspect in ARQ schemes is knowing when to decode and when not to decode across the different rounds. Towards this we have the following deﬁnition.\nWe deﬁne aggressive intermediate halting policies to be the family of policies that halt decoding in the ﬁrst round whenever the minimum singular value of the channel scales as ρ − for some > 0, which do not decode in the second to the L-1 round, and which decode at the last round iff a) they have not decoded in the ﬁrst round and b) the channel is not in outage with respect to the effective rate of ARQ scheme.\nGiven such aggressive halting policies, the L round scheme reduces to a two round scheme where the second round comprises of (L − 1)T channel uses. As noted before, for notational uniformity with earlier works in [5], [6], we will continue to use the notation of the L-round schemes but again clarify that only one bit of ARQ feedback is needed.\nFurthermore we will henceforth use the term ARQ- compatible, minimum delay, NVD, rate-1 lattice designs to refer to the family of n T × n T lattice designs X ARQ,L C \t with total number of transmitted integers κ = 2n T , with non- vanishing determinant (NVD) 8 for r ≤ 1, and with all the information appearing in all rounds.\nProposition 1: A minimum delay ARQ scheme with L = n T rounds achieves d ∗ (r) with c(r) ≤ c red (r), irrespective of the ARQ-compatible, minimum delay, NVD, rate-1 lattice design, for any aggressive intermediate halting policy, and any sphere decoding order policy.\nThe following describes a very simple MIMO ARQ coding implementation that achieves d ∗ (r) with c(r) ≤ c red (r). The proof of this proposition will appear later on, and is crucial in the achievability part of the proof of Theorem 1.\nProposition 2: The minimum delay ARQ scheme with L = n T rounds, implemented with any aggressive intermediate halting policy, any sphere decoding order policy, and a rate-1\nlattice design X ARQ,L C \t drawn from the center of perfect codes (cf. [8], [9]) 9 , achieves d ∗ (r) with c(r) ≤ c red (r).\nTheorem 1 has quantiﬁed the computational reserves that are sufﬁcient to achieve DMT optimality. These computational reserves can be seen to be smaller than those required to achieve the same optimal DMT d ∗ (r) without feedback. For example, given any known minimum-delay DMT optimal design which remains ﬁxed for all r, in the absence of feedback, the exponent needed to achieve d ∗ (r) is that in (2) (cf. [2, Theorem 6] and [3, Corollary 1b]) and takes the form\n(for integer r = 0, 1, · · · , n T ), whereas as we have just seen, for L = n T , T = 1 this exponent reduces to a much smaller\nwhereas the feedback aided complexity required by the feed- back scheme in Proposition 2 scales as\nGenerally, given a rate that scales linearly with n T , in the absence of feedback the complexity exponent of achieving d ∗ (r) scales with n 2 T , whereas the feedback aided complexity exponent scales with n T .\nExample 2: Figure 1 considers the case of n T = 4 ≤ n R and Rayleigh fading, and compares the above complexity upper bound in the presence of feedback (L = 4, T = 1), to the equivalent complexity exponent in (5) of achieving the same optimal DMT d ∗ (r) without ARQ feedback (Perfect codes and natural, ﬁxed decoding ordering (cf. [2])). The feedback-aided complexity exponent reveals an exponential reduction by a factor of n T = 4.\nWe now consider the case of n R ≤ n T , and speciﬁcally the case where n R |n T (i.e., n T is an integer multiple of n R ), to observe again how simple implementations offer substantial reductions in complexity. In terms of statistics, the results hold for any i.i.d. regular fading distribution.\nTheorem 2: In the MIMO ARQ channel with n R |n T , the minimum complexity exponent c(r) required to achieve d ∗ (r), minimized over all lattice designs, all halting policies, and all minimum delay ARQ schemes with L ≤ n T rounds of ARQ, is bounded as c(r) ≤ c red (r) where\nwhich is a piecewise linear function that, for integer r, takes the form\nApplying as the constructive part of the proof of the above theorem, the following describes a very simple MIMO ARQ block-diagonal repetition coding implementation that achieves d ∗ (r) with a much reduced c(r) ≤ c red (r).\nProposition 3: A minimum delay ARQ scheme with L = n T , T = 1, implemented with any aggressive intermediate halting policy, any sphere decoding order policy, and a rate-\nblock-diagonal repetition lattice design X ARQ,L C \t where the (rate-1) block component code is drawn from the center of n R × n R perfect codes, achieves d ∗ (r) with c(r) ≤ c red (r) from Theorem 2.\nThe proof of Theorem 2 and Proposition 3 will be presented in Appendix B. Of interest is the special MISO-ARQ case of n R = 1, where the above described scheme will allow for a zero complexity exponent, and for a complexity that scales as a subpolynomial function of ρ and as a subexponential function of the number of codeword bits and of the rate.\nCorollary 2a: Over the n T ×1 MISO channel, the minimum delay ARQ scheme with L = n T rounds, implemented with a rate- 1 n\nrepetition QAM design X ARQ,L C \t , achieves d ∗ (r) with c(r) = 0.\nThis corollary follows directly from Theorem 2. We proceed with a few examples.\nExample 3 (Corresponding to Theorem 2 and Proposition 3): For the 4 × 2 MIMO channel with L = 4, T = 1, applying a\n \nf 0 γf 1 0 \t 0 f 1 f 0 0 \t 0\n \nwhere f 0 , f 1 ∼ QAM , together with an aggressive inter- mediate halting policy for the ﬁrst round decoder, and with any sphere decoding ordering policy, can achieve the optimal d ∗ (r) of the 4 × 2 channel, and can do so with computational resources of N max . = ρ c red (r) ﬂops, which for integer r translates to N max . = ρ 1 nR r(n R −r) = ρ r 2 (2−r) .\nThe proof follows from the footsteps of the [2, proof of Theorem 2]. Due to space limitations we restrict this expo- sition to the proof steps that are necessary to understand the complexity exponent for the novel ARQ schemes discussed in this paper. For further understanding of encoders and decoders considered here, the reader is referred to [2], [4]. We begin by establishing necessary conditions for L-round ARQ scheme to achieve d ∗ (r) over an n T × n R (n R ≥ n T ) MIMO.\nCondition 1: To achieve maximum diversity gain of n R .n T the total number of channel uses LT ≥ n T . For minimum delay (T = 1) L-round ARQ schemes with L ≤ n T , it then follows that L = n T .\nCondition 2: To achieve maximum multiplexing gain of n T the total number of integers transmitted κ ≥ 2n T T = 2n T .\nIt can be seen from [2] that the complexity of sphere decoder increases with κ. Thus, for minimum delay L-round ARQ schemes with L ≤ n T , the tightest upper bound on the complexity exponent is established by considering T = 1, L = n T and κ = 2n T . Setting T = 1 and L = n T implies use of at least rate-1 lattice designs for L-round ARQ scheme for achieving DMT performance of d ∗ (r) for 0 ≤ r ≤ n T . We will later show that encoding-decoding policy described in Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 achieve DMT performance\nof d ∗ (r) for T = 1, L = n T and κ = 2n T , which in turn implies that lim ρ→∞ r = r 1 , where r 1 is the multiplexing gain for the ﬁrst round of ARQ.\nHaving established the necessary parameters we proceed to prove the claim of Theorem 1. Following the footsteps of the [2, proof of Theorem 2] we can show that in the presence of aggressive halting policy and SD with search radius ξ >\nd ∗ ( r L ) log ρ, an upper bound on the complexity exponent for ﬁrst round decoder can be obtained as the solution to a constrained maximization problem according to\nwhere µ j − log σ j (H H C H C ) log ρ \t , j = 1, · · · , n T with µ 1 ≥ · · · ≥ µ n T , where σ j denotes j-th singular value of H H C H C and where we have made use of the fact that lim ρ→∞ r = r 1 . In the limit → 0 this upper bound simpliﬁes to\nwhere for rate-1 lattice designs we have θ 2 = ρ 1−r L , where r L = r L denotes multiplexing gain for L-th round of ARQ. The vectorized real valued representation of L-th round system model takes the form\nx L = (x T 1 , · · · , x T L ) T ∈ R 2n T L with x t = [Re{X ARQ,L t,C } T , Im{X ARQ,L t,C } T ] T for t = 1, · · · , L,\nwhere X ARQ,L t,C \t is t-th column of X ARQ,L C \t , w L and y L can be deﬁned similarly. The vectorized codeword x L takes the form (cf. [3])\nwhere G ∈ R 2Ln T ×κ is the lattice generator matrix, where κ = 2n T and where R ⊂ R κ is a natural bijection of the code shaping region that preserves the code, and contains the all zero vector 0. For simplicity we consider R [−1, 1] κ to be a hypercube in R κ , although this could be relaxed. Combining (6) and (7) yields the equivalent system model\ny L =M L s + w L , \t (8a) where M L ρ 1 2 − rL 2 H L G ∈ R 2n R L×κ . \t (8b)\nLet G = [Γ T 1 Γ T 2 · · · Γ T L ] T , where Γ i ∈ C 2n T ×2n T , for i = 1, · · · , L.\nThen the equivalent code-channel matrix (M L ) takes the form\n \n \n \n \n(M L ) H (M L ) =ρ 1−r L (Γ H 1 H H R H R Γ 1 + · · · + Γ H L H H C H C Γ L ), ρ 1−r L Γ H 1 H H R H R Γ 1 , \t (11)\nwhere A B denotes that A − B is positive-semideﬁnite. Without loss of generality we can assume that Γ 1 is full-rank. It then follows that the singular values of M L can be lower bounded as\nwhere we have made use of the fact that σ min (Γ 1 ) . = ρ 0 and where ι 2 (i) \t i 2 .\nUsing (12) and following the footsteps of the [2, proof of Theorem 2], the upper bound on the complexity exponent for the L-th round decoding of minimum delay L-round ARQ schemes achieving d ∗ (r) can be obtained as the solution to a constrained maximization problem according to\ns.t. I(µ) ≤ d ∗ (r), \t (13b) µ 1 ≥ · · · ≥ µ n T ≥ 0, \t (13c)\nwhere we have made use of the fact that L = n T and r L = r L . The solution to this optimization problem takes the form\nFor the proof to be complete we must now prove that the aforementioned family of ARQ schemes, halting policies and lattice designs can indeed achieve the desired DMT d ∗ (r). For this purpose we recall the following lemma from [10]:\nLemma 1: For an i.i.d. regular fading channel, a minimum delay ARQ scheme with L = n T rounds achieves d ∗ (r) for all ARQ-compatible, minimum delay, NVD, rate-1 lattice designs, all intermediate aggressive halting policies and a sphere decoder with search radius ξ > d ∗ ( r L ) log ρ.\nIn the presence of Lemma 1 and upper bound c red (r), it is direct to see that a minimum delay ARQ scheme with L = n T rounds achieves d ∗ (r) with c(r) ≤ c red (r), irrespective of the ARQ-compatible, minimum delay, NVD, rate-1 lattice design, for any aggressive intermediate halting policy, and any decoding order policy. This proves Theorem 1, Proposition 1 and Proposition 2.\nIn this section we present the sketch of the proof for Theorem 2 and Proposition 3. Let lattice design θX ARQ,L C\n \n \nlattice designs we have θ 2 = ρ 1− nT rL nR , where r L = r 1 L denotes multiplexing gain for L-th round of ARQ, and where block component code X ∈ C n R ×n R .

After substituting for H C and X ARQ,L C \t in (15) we get that\n \n \nWe observe that the lattice design in (14) converts the system into an equivalent channel ˜ H C with inverted channel dimensions. It follows that for this equivalent channel ˜ H C the system parameters are given by n T = n R , n R = n T , T = 1, L = n T and r L = n T n\nr L . Since for the new system we have n R ≥ n T , Proposition 3 and Theorem 2 can now be proved by following the footsteps of the proof of Theorem 1.
